      "text": "I&#x27;m facinated by the ability of so many solo developers building their own profitable internet startups.<p>I talked to 30 of them who are making collectively more than $200,000 per month in revenue, and their revenue == profit.<p>Here&#x27;s a small free e-book I put together based on their answers, hoping this will be helpful for other devs looking to start their own SaaS or some other internet product. The book goes through following topics based on the comments of these &quot;microfounders&quot;:<p>1) How to come up with a <i>good</i> idea?\n2) How to find your first customers?\n3) How to continue finding customers later?\n4) What&#x27;s their advice in general for devs wanting to build a profitable solo internet startup?<p>I&#x27;ve been talking to many many founders like these and I&#x27;d be happy to give my perspective on any questions you may have.",
