      "text": "It occurs to me that the Dunning-Kruger effect and imposter syndrome are like mirror images of each other.  One is to see yourself as more competent than you are in areas that you know little about; the other is to see yourself as less competent than you are in areas that you know a large amount about.  (In both cases, the better alternative is to evaluate yourself accurately.)<p>Are these things the opposite sides of the same coin?  Are they the opposite ends of a spectrum of &quot;the more you know, the more you know you don&#x27;t know&quot;?  Or is the inverse similarity between them just superficial, and there is no relationship between them?",
