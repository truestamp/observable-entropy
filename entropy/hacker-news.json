      "text": "Hey all, I&#x27;m Dhruv and also the Co-Founder at EZiD (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ezid.io&#x2F;). We actually started this because all of us hated passwords and built our APIs thinking that users would only use it for simple passwordless sign up and login and we even got a few beta users who switched from Auth0 or their own custom auth methods to try us out because they believed our APIs were a lot more flexible.<p>Little did we know that our beta users were also using our APIs for other reasons such as outbound email marketing where they would embed a users email into the CTA and just like the sign-up process bypass the auth wall so they could claim any discount or promotion that was being sent to them.<p>This made us think how auth should actually be reimagined. Instead of it just being at the start, we should start thinking what kinda auth, when, and where in the user journey it should be used.<p>Here are the docs incase anyone wants to play around with it! We&#x27;re still in closed beta but happy to onboard a few more users if anyone is keen to join us<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foremost-cotija-b6e.notion.site&#x2F;Docs-94f0a168c0914a61ab5339c32750577e<p>Our beta users have seen a user conversion go up by 175% and we are close to 1200 MAU!<p>Also, we know our website doesn&#x27;t look the best and this is because we put all our effort into making sure our APIs robust and bringing on early beta users to test our product",
