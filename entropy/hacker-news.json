      "text": "How do people on HN handle backups?<p>Personally, I use MacOS&#x27;s Time Machine, since it is super polished and makes restoring files and browsing what the filesystem previously looked like a breeze. It &quot;just works&quot; and is the only backup solution I have used to restore lost files (who knows how well a backup solution works unless you actually test it). I have even been able to set up a Samba server on a Raspberry Pi so I don&#x27;t need to plug a hard drive into my computer to backup. I upload an encrypted sparesebundle to Backblaze B2 every day with rclone. As I have been looked into using Linux as a daily driver, I have wondered if there was any backup solution as flawless as Time Machine. Does such a piece of software exist?<p>In sum, I just want to hear how other people on HN do backups – even if it does not solve my problem, though software suggestions are appreciated ;)",
