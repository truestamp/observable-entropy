She has recently given birth leading to a resumption of normal immune system strength, and a resumption of the itchiness. She regularly uses an eyebag (warm bag to melt eye oils helps with bleparitis) and we’re trying to keep the central heating off.<p>What Id really appreciate is any ideas for things we can try. Im going to be shampooing the carpets (in case of allergens left by previous owners pets) and maybe CBD oil. We’ll be documenting everything we try so yeah, any ideas would be great because at the moment this feels a bit hopeless. Thanks!",
