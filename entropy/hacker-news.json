      "text": "Are you jaded about The Internet? I&#x27;ve been online 20 years now and I feel like I&#x27;ve reached the pinnacle of what The Internet is about and have in a way <i>reached the end of The Internet</i>. I&#x27;ve seen just about everything you could want, and participated in many communities over the years, and I feel everything is just &#x27;samey&#x27; now and follows the same pattern. It&#x27;s hard for anything on The Internet to stand out and be unique (at least for me). YMMV on this.<p>Now with Web3&#x2F;NFTs&#x2F;cryptocurrency people are building an abstraction layer on top of the web and want to decentralize all the things, which is good to see, but I want to see all that fleshed out properly before I dive into it and leverage it. This is the <i>shiny thing</i> I look forward to on the web, but it&#x27;s still early days. Other than that, the web seems kinda boring lately.<p>Are you jaded about the web too? I&#x27;d like to hear your thoughts!",

      "text": "What would typescript look like if it were freed from the shackles of JavaScript? Could it be a first class language compiled to machine code, .NET IL, or wasm, with runtime type checking, and cleaner and less bloated?<p>Are there any forks of Typescript (or TypeScript-like languages) exploring these ideas?<p>Rationale for Question:\nAfter using TypeScript for some years, I find C#, as good a language as it is, fairly clunky. C# lacks many things that make TypeScript so expressive: straightforward first-class functions and union types, for example. I think my ideal language would be something that marries the best parts of C# and TypeScript.",
