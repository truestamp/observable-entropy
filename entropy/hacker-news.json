      "text": "Hey HN, I made <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkians.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkians.com</a> which is a game where all the action and state is contained in the url. The game involves taking care of little pets (emojis) that live in your url bar. Kind of like tamagotchi or sims. Feed them, play with them, and watch out for enemies!<p>There&#x27;s no server, just emojis in the url and client-side logic. Any linkians url using the supported emojis is a valid game state so you can save your game, or type out your own url and send it to a friend.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback.",
