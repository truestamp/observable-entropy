      "text": "For the past 25 years, I have been involved in what today is called cyber security, mostly as a consultant based in Europe. \nWhile cyber security remains interesting and important to me, I believe society today has bigger challenges to tackle than securing corporations.<p>In the future, I would like to make a positive contribution to saving the climate, one that goes beyond just managing my own day to day behavior. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see where I could best apply my experience and skills to make an impact. I don&#x27;t believe there is a huge need for cyber security in climate challenges and think I have a mismatched skillset, or maybe I am missing something ?<p>So I am turning to the HN hivemind for your insights, any ideas on where my skills could make the most impact towards this goal would be greatly appreciated !",
