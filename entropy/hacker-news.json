      "text": "Seeing as recruitment for any company can be challenging, a good place to start for trying to hire good &#x27;culture-fits&#x27; is to ask yourself what the perfect employee looks like.<p>In your experience, what characteristics does the perfect employee have?<p>Disclaimer: Putting aside the fact that there is no such thing as a perfect employee, I would like to know what you think one would look like in your experience.<p>Some ideas from my side:<p>TEAM PLAYER\nIf the company works with teams primarily, then a poor team player can spell disaster no matter how technically gifted they are. A good team player is therefore necessary.<p>TECHNICALLY EXCELLENT\nThey have experience in the tech stack of their position. The more experience the better of course.<p>GREAT SOFT SKILLS\nProbably the most overlooked in my experience. We had an excellent tech lead when starting our company, but he could not work with anyone or teach anyone. He was completely inept socially and would insult people (whether he meant to or not) on a regular basis.<p>COMMUNICATION SKILLS\nDifficult to measure, but incredibly important. A good senior engineer with bad comms are inconvenient to work with. A mid-level engineer with excellent comms are a pleasure to work with.",
