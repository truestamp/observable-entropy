      "text": "I built a complete game using Snap&#x27;s AR platform in about 6 weeks. I&#x27;d been intrigued by Snap&#x27;s AR ambitions and wanted to kick the tires on their platform.<p>The YouTube video description contains a link to the Lens: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lens.snapchat.com&#x2F;d04efc6953fd498c87e25c92fef727e7?sender_web_id=6dfa4f56-8eca-4af1-97b3-03057da8df21&amp;device_type=desktop&amp;is_copy_url=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lens.snapchat.com&#x2F;d04efc6953fd498c87e25c92fef727e7?s...</a><p>How to play:<p>- Joypad y axis moves the helicopter along the ray pointing from the camera. You can therefore tilt the phone up to fly &quot;up&quot;.<p>- Altitude is also controlled by aiming the phone. The helicopter tries to match the altitude of a point that is fixed in front of the camera. So you can move up by aiming up or by actually lifting the phone higher.<p>- Joypad x axis strafes.<p>- If you lose track of the helicopter, a blue arrow will appear after about 5 seconds.<p>- Blow up enemies and try to stay alive :)<p>How it works under the hood:<p>- Loads of JavaScript. Lenses are surprisingly programmer-friendly. As a non-artist, this is great. Almost everything can be driven completely by code, although most creators opt to use pre-made components with minimal scripting.<p>- The game uses a custom physics engine with OBB-based collision detections that I wrote from scratch. Snap now has integrated physics that seem to be based on PhysX (i.e., the same as Unity&#x27;s) but this was released well into my development process after I had already rolled my own.<p>- I opted not to use environmental mesh reconstruction because it is performance intensive and gives dubious results on lower-end phones. When I started development, it was only enabled for Lidar-based phones but is since available everywhere.<p>- I instead detect horizontal planes using an API that Snap hasn&#x27;t really documented. I found a snippet of code in their API docs and opened up the Lens Studio .exe to find the names of the other plane events I needed.<p>- Planes are used to create collision boxes that extend to the floor so the helicopter can bump into furniture.<p>- AI-controlled enemy helicopters plot routes using a heightmap generated from the plane data to avoid colliding with obstacles when possible.<p>Takeaways:<p>- This has arguably become my favorite AR prototyping platform. Much faster idea-to-PoC iteration time than anything else out there.<p>- The platform is surprisingly full-featured.<p>- The Lens Studio Editor is remarkably polished and, despite some bugs here and there, is very stable.<p>- The deployment story is second to none. Deploying to the phone involves a single click and is done over the Internet (no need for any tethering or wireless pairing).<p>- Debugging on-device is still challenging (all you can do is log a few lines) but I was assured that an actual debugger is coming soon.<p>- Economic viability: unfortunately, it is not really possible to directly monetize lenses. Most creators contract with brands to create branded lenses.<p>Future plans:<p>- I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping an eye on Snap&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>- No plans for any more full-fledged lenses but I do have some ideas for prototypes I&#x27;d like to try in anticipation of commercially viable mixed reality HMDs hitting the market soon (e.g., Meta&#x27;s Project Cambria).<p>- I may update the game with a tutorial mode and a co-located multiplayer mode (co-op play or PvP) provided I get the necessary support from the Snap dev team.<p>Hope you enjoy and are inspired to dive into AR if you haven&#x27;t already :D",
