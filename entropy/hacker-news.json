      "text": "I have 2 children aged 1 and 3.  They both started swimming lessons at a few weeks old, and this has been quite successful.  They enjoy swimming and are starting to pick up some skills.<p>So my question is: what things have you signed your kids up to, and what was successful and why?<p>I&#x27;d like them to have lots of experiences so they can discover what they enjoy, but there is a limit to the number of things they can try.  I know they are very young now, but time goes by quickly and I want to be prepared.<p>I&#x27;m considering more sports, but also music or dance classes.  There are also non-physical things like chess club to consider as they get a bit older.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been out of the loop for awhile, but back in 2017 I was a big fan of Polymer by Google (web components utilizing shadow DOM.) At the time there was a feeling you didn&#x27;t need frameworks if you had components you could use like html tags.<p>In 2021 I got back into it:<p>I took a look at Blazor. Ok, that&#x27;s just web components, where the file name is the component name.<p>I took a look at Svelte. Ok, that just web components with reactivity. Svelte looks like the inspiration for Blazor.<p>I took a look at Angular. They have components now or did they always have components?<p>I took a look at React. Look, they&#x27;re starting to use Polymer type components inside React components.<p>I took a look at web components, not longer called Polymer it seems, and wow, they&#x27;ve made a lot of progress. Salesforce.com is a big user (a company I respect for their tech) and Google itself is a big user. Google says Web Components are everywhere and I&#x27;m using them a lot without knowing it.<p>So have Shadow DOM components arrived?<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Web_Components",
