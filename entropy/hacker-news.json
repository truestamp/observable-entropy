I though the certifications would be a game changer but I pretty much had to casually drop that information on interviews and suffocate the pain of having no big reactions to it.<p>It&#x27;s was very underwhelming, and I&#x27;d like to know more about people who are certified, what did it change in your life? Were you able to leverage that to a better salary, job, contracts, etc?<p>I&#x27;ve asked a similar question on a kubernetes subreddit and I&#x27;ve got a lot of interesting point of views.
