As an example there are flask-user, flask-restplus, flask-themes, and so on...<p>I think it&#x27;s time that the Flask community in general or Pallets Project in particular think about having a global community that will manage the extensions and maintain them, it&#x27;s really important.<p>One suggestion would be to have something like OCA (Odoo Community Association) that maintains modules from the Odoo Open Source community.<p>Let&#x27;s leave our egos aside and build a real Flask community.",
