      "text": "TL:DR How can software documentation be improved? What featured would you like to see in a knowledge transfer&#x2F; documentation platform.<p>The Long version: Software documentation and knowledge transfer are important parts of the software development process. Hate it or love it, most developers still have to do it but usually don&#x27;t do it well. In general, a Wiki is as good as it gets and is usually not enough. At my job I once had to do a knowledge transfer where we had 7 screen recordings over 3 hours long then had no where to put those videos nor was there a tool that made it easier to search the videos thus making it too difficult to find the part that I needed in the video fast. Honestly, that experience sucked but I still had to do it for work.<p>How do you do knowledge transfer and documentation? What do you hate most about it? What could be better ? If you where to have a single tool dedicated to software documentation, what would it be and what features would it have?<p>I am asking because Me and my cofounder faced this issue at our companies and decided to build, DocIt, a platform where developers can document their process and transfer knowledge. We hypothesize that with video, screenshots, voice recordings, diagram making and more, developers could create better and more interactive documents quicker and easier. We both want ourselves and others to forget the days where you need to use Excel, SnippingTool, some screen recorder( Zoom or Webex), Teams, Dropbox, a diagram maker and more to get the perfect knowledge transfer job done. We would greatly appreciate if anyone can share their experience and any suggestions. We are developing our MVP.<p>To learn more please checkout our landing page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docit.dev&#x2F;  and please signup to our mailing list so we could update you on our progress and when we will have a working beta ( it is on the website)<p>Thank you!",
