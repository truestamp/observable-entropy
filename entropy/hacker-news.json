I wanted something self-contained that helped me develop intuition rather than fluency.<p>My hope is this is helpful for casual programmers, professionals from other fields who interact with code, or engineers who haven&#x27;t had much exposure to interpreters or compilers.<p>Hope this helps anyone else who&#x27;s curious about getting a sense of Lisp and what makes it special with a limited time investment!<p>Feedback or other cool Lisp things welcome :)",
