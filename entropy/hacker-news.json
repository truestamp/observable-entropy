This is particularly annoying if you&#x27;re just getting in your car and need to figure out which street to turn onto.<p>Doesn&#x27;t the map use the phone&#x27;s built-in compass, which should be reasonably accurate even while not moving? What prevents the app from knowing the phone&#x27;s orientation accurately while stationary?<p>Always been curious about this.",
