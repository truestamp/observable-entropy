      "text": "I have always used Twitter to connect with my developer friends, keep up with what developers around me are talking about and to make myself also followable, but this has become harder and harder to do as time went by. Most of my timeline consists of random tweets from people I don&#x27;t follow, and no amount of fine-tuning appears to fix this. Even if you manage to disable likes and retweets from everyone you follow, Twitter starts spamming your notifications with &quot;recommended tweets&quot; which manage to be even worse than the likes. There&#x27;s a &quot;don&#x27;t show me this again&quot; button, but I&#x27;m convinced this does nothing but increment an integer at some analytics metric that nobody is keeping track of.<p>Which platforms could I use to achieve what I&#x27;m looking for? I want to know what certain people are talking about, but I have zero interest in any form of social media features like recommendations and networks. Is RSS my only hope?",

Since the dawn of man (the full stack developer = man), &quot;Full Stack&quot; just meant frontend and backend development. But now, there is a group of people who seem to be calling it only &quot;Full Stack&quot; if it also includes a set of feature-complete modules for doing the most common tasks, such as ORMs for interacting with databases, a way of handling caching or even reading&#x2F;writing to queues.<p>So what is it, who is right, or is there even more definitions out there?<p>Once this poll is complete, we can hopefully all agree on a common definition.",
