      "text": "I am building an online marketplace for service providers. The service provider will have the option of two profiles, basic vs. premium profile.\nMy current thoughts on pricing structure are as follows.<p>Basic Profile - Limited feature set - Free + transaction fee<p>Premium Profile - Full feature set - $25 a month + smaller transaction fee<p>How large should transaction fees be in order to not have vendors move off platform &#x2F; be discouraged from working with us but still enough to make some money? What’s the sweet spot?<p>Should the transaction fee be taken from the vendor side or on the customer side as an additional charge at checkout?<p>Should there be a small flat fee put on transactions?<p>Any other things &#x2F; options to do?<p>Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated",
