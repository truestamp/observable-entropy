      "text": "So I found gpt3, tried it out, and was generally impressed by what it could do. I wondered if I could make something that can do symptom analysis and ultimately replace a clinician entirely. So it is an AI symptom analyzer that can adjust&#x2F;suggest new medication a patient needs to take if their current one doesn&#x27;t suit them or refill via e-prescription. I want to completely replace medical doctors from the entire landscape and make it frictionless. Thoughts?",

I think the effects of big distribution model changes (e.g. VHS &amp; DVDs at rental places, then redbox, then just streaming) have shifted the business model of the industry, but have there been other more niche things that shape what gets produced? For instance, are there fewer movies that feature plane crashes because they won&#x27;t get picked up by airlines to be shown on their planes?",
