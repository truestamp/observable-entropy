      "text": "Most of the gnarly things I&#x27;ve had to deal with while building and operations K8s clusters and related infrastructure is around stateful apps.<p>Most modern cloud applications and services rely on a set of services for storage that are mostly hosted by a cloud provider. I understand Kubernetes&#x27; intention is to help support all workloads. My thought is that those starting now don&#x27;t need to inherit all that complexity - code paths, operations, possible risks in terms of security and stability as that part of the code changes, and the myriad of configuration options.<p>Instead a stateless container orchestrator can focus on things that maybe more relevant to modern cloud apps - like improved autoscaling, traffic routing, placement, etc.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to learn about new applications that are being built that require persistent disk storage.",
