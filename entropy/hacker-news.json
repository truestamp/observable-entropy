It&#x27;s hosted with Cloudflare Pages and built with Next.js.<p>As we grow and build out marketing, content, and design teams I&#x27;m looking for Jamstack compatible tooling for a more user friendly (ideally web driven) WYSIWYG SSG&#x2F;CMS combo.<p>Ideally we&#x27;d be able to achieve the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of a web development team (currently big on React) being able to implement anything that needs to be done while also maintaining ease of use for updates and new content from the various non-technically skilled teams.<p>In my initial research I&#x27;ve found it incredibly easy to get lost in a sea of SSG, CMS, headless CMS, etc options.<p>Can anyone suggest a unicorn&#x2F;silver bullet approach that meets these needs?<p>Thanks!",
