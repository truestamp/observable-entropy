      "text": "Hey everyone. After the fourth Auth0 outage in the last two months has knocked out my app, I&#x27;m somewhat at a loss of what to do. I don&#x27;t have a ton of application auth experience, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my fault, e.g., for not knowing to develop multiple tenants in multiple regions, or for not falling back to some other service. Alternatively, if it is generally reasonable to assume that an auth provider is almost-always-available, then I&#x27;m wondering if anyone on HN has had positive experiences with Auth0 competitors<p>Through some downtime accounting magic, they are reporting 99.87% availability, but my stress levels from responding to customer emails on Friday and this morning say otherwise\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.auth0.com&#x2F;",
