      "text": "Anyone notice lately an increase of spam mails breaking through Gmail&#x27;s (usually excellent) spam filters?<p>I&#x27;ve had a Gmail account since its early beta and I&#x27;ve never seen so many spams worming their way into my inbox as I can see these days. Granted, I&#x27;m not <i>submerged</i> by spam, but after many years of having simply forgotten about the spam scourge (I would get maybe one or two per YEAR!), seeing three or four per week is quite irritating.<p>Another thing I had noticed last year was the sheer number of messages accumulated in Spam; for decades there were just 150 or 200 at any given moment; starting last year, their number jumped considerably, and for a couple of months, Gmail&#x27;s Spam folder had more than 1,000! Still, only very rarely I would see one in my inbox (I use IMAP and I exclude Spam from my subscribed folders; I only noticed their huge number when I had to use the web interface.)",
