      "text": "Hey Folks,\nAs you know most modern applications are built using open source software e.g log4j. I am conducting research on “Current and future state of open source security”. As we founders do use a lot of open source software to save time and cost, I would like to discuss it with you to discuss and learn at the same time share my insight.<p>P.S: I am not trying to sell anything. I have been working in cyber security since 2013 and worked for many big organizations like Google, Facebook etc.<p>Let me know if you are up for discussion.<p>Thanks\nBest",
