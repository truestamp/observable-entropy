      "text": "Hi HN,\nOften I have observed that a relatively common approach that people undertake to complete their objectives is momentum work. So this would be something like sitting on a project and working on it continuously for next 2-3 days\ntill we reach at some point of accomplishment.\nAlthough, what I have realized that the approach of taking breaks in between and then coming back to the objectives usually ends up in leading to more objectives accomplished.<p>An eg. would be if I have to run 3 miles(or Kms) and I do it at one go without stopping I would end up in fatigue at the end\nthough it might be feel better and less cumbersome when I am walking.\nOn the other hand if I run the same distance taking certain breaks in middle I might end up covering more than distance planned\nand not with so much fatigue.<p>I am thinking about how a similar approach would like when completing our daily projects and planning them on a bigger picture.\nAny opinions or discussion would be helpful in general.<p>Thanks",
