      "text": "Hey HN: Kaveh here, founder of www.usage.ai (we help companies cut AWS spend automatically)<p>We&#x27;ve heard from users that engineers don&#x27;t like having yet-another-dashboard they need to remember to check periodically. This is our attempt at making AWS cost savings even easier: You can instantly approve new cost savings without leaving Slack!<p>In the future, we&#x27;d like to develop an even deeper Slack integration so that engineers can interact and ask questions about the cost savings recommendations Usage makes.<p>Have you experienced any issues with your AWS spend? Happy to chat directly: kaveh@usage.ai<p>Blog post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.usage.ai&#x2F;usage-launches-slack-support&#x2F;",
