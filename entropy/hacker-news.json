It means that the person can think of a problem critically, independent of any programming language and then design a solution. Then they can implement it in whatever language it needs to be implemented in. And does so efficiently. Ofcourse, to do this, they have to know the entire stack from the highest of high to the lowest of low abstraction levels of the machine.<p>Is this possible in practice? If so how? Any books?",
