      "text": "Hi everyone,\nI&#x27;m an engineer (not a software engineer) and I work as a researcher in a university. In my short career I&#x27;ve always written some little code, in particular I script in MATLAB. My programs were never more than 100&#x2F;200 lines of code.<p>Recently I was appointed as responsible for a big project that lead me in writing more complex software than just small scripts. It is still nothing big (few tens of functions, each with 50-200 lines of code), but it is for sure bigger than before and bigger than I was used to.<p>This code is constantly updated and must be shared with collegues. I also develop on two different machines (the office Windows desktop and my WFH setup composed by a MacBook).<p>Is Git the only way to go to mantain the code? The problem that I have with Git are these:\n1. It is not easy to learn. I have no problem in learning it, but older academics are not willing to put the effort...\n2. Sync between my two machines is not always easy, fur sure not as easy as Dropbox.<p>Is Git the only way to go? If yes, do you have some websites where it is well explained and easy to understand?<p>Thanks!",
