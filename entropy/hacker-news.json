      "text": "I need to get up from my chair and take a walk at regular intervals for medical reasons, But I often forget to do that when I&#x27;m immersed with work, So I wanted a solution which reminds me to take a walk at regular intervals automatically.<p>Hence I created Butt Mover to solve that problem, It has two parts;<p>1. Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.<p>2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.<p>Those who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.<p>I&#x27;ve been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.<p>I hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.",

At that point, you need to get out of the habit of using &quot;Next&quot; to proceed and start using your new document, and must use &quot;Done&quot; instead.<p>Every time I hit one of those weird little UI inconsistencies, it makes me feel like I&#x27;m about to trip and fall like in music, when a drummer misses the beat.",
