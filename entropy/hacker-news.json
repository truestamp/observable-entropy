Specially consumption without focus. In other words I&#x27;d consuming all kinds of information that may be very interesting but may never be materially useful to me or my goals. But having focus by virtue of producing I can leverage having access to the worlds information by being able to get all the information I need about something I am working on.<p>Long winded way of saying that I want to move from be a consumer of things to producer of something (Even if its super small at the beginning)<p>1) What kinds of things have you tried when you began your shift?\n2) What is some advice you would give to a beginner who intends t make this transition to increase their odds of &#x27;transitioning&#x2F;sticking&#x27;",
