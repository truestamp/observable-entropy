      "text": "I received a verbal offer from a US company.<p>The offer was for full-time employment @ $XXX,XXX USD + benefits, flexible vacation, and &quot;equity&quot; (unspecified).<p>It was a decent offer. (And, importantly, I&#x27;m bullish about the company and excited about the opportunity.)<p>After a couple of weeks I&#x27;ve now finally received the paperwork. (Likely delayed because of the Christmas break, and due to the fact that I don&#x27;t live in America and I&#x27;m not American.)<p>The offer is still $XXX,XXX USD. But no benefits, or equity... as it&#x27;s no longer an offer but an agreement to become an &quot;Independent Contractor&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m fine to become a contractor. I would prefer to be an employee. But it&#x27;s probably legally easier for the company to &quot;employ&quot; me this way.<p>But if I&#x27;m not an employee, and I&#x27;m not getting benefits or equity... should I not push for $XXX,XXX + some percentage USD.<p>How should I handle this situation? Any and all advice appreciated!",
