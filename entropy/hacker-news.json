      "text": "I&#x27;ve worked at my current company since my college internship in 2012, and have not sought a new gig in all of that time. The company was a travel tech startup that I joined as an early employee, and it was acquired a few years ago. The app is still active and supported, but it feels time to start exploring what else is out there.<p>In case it matters, my background is largely in various QA and product roles, most recently transitioning from project management to product management.<p>Are the traditional places like Linkedin and Indeed the best places to upload resumes, update skills, etc.? Do I need to fully dive into the job-hunting waters and network with recruiters to get a good idea of where I &quot;stack&quot; so to speak?",
