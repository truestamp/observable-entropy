For example, an OS that is tailored <i>just</i> for coding only would be nice, instead of having one device that I use for <i>every</i> aspect of my daily computing.<p>Privacy&#x2F;Anonymity is not my concern. I won&#x27;t be doing anything sensitive in this OS.<p>Any suggestions?<p>(I&#x27;ve looked into Apache Guacamole &amp; VNC BTW. Didn&#x27;t like them).",
