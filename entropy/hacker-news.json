I am not talking about PC with Linux where I feel safe and no need to stick a webcam with a piece of tape. I am talking about smartphone where I feel a need to have some different smartphones for every different app, in order to kind of not letting my bank to know whan I&#x27;m watching on my tiktok.<p>Is there any movements to make citizen&#x27;s smartphones safe for owner from Google or Apple despite using some apps from their application stores? Are there any cars w&#x2F;o proprietary software except of some cars w&#x2F;o computers? How does that happened?",
