      "text": "As I was attempting to log in to my TransUnion account today, I went to fill in my creds using my password manager. I received an interesting error message that stated passwords had to be between 8 and 15 characters. That caused me to raise my eyebrows since, as one might expect, my password-manager-generated password is longer than that and it has worked perfectly fine in the past.<p>On a hunch, I deleted the excess characters from my password. Lo and behold: I got right in. Unless I&#x27;m missing something, the only way they could have truncated it thusly would be if they&#x27;re storing it in plain text, right? Is anyone able to repro?<p>You&#x27;d think the credit bureaus would have invested in better security &#x2F; developers after the Equifax breach, but, perhaps not so unsurprisingly, it looks like they still have their heads in the sand.",
