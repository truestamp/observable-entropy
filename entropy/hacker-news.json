      "text": "I was ordering pizza from Domino&#x27;s this evening and noticed in the shopping cart area a little segment saying<p><pre><code>    Hiring Delivery Experts at jobs.domnos.com Earn up to $30 per hour\n</code></pre>\n<i>Weird</i>, I thought, that looks like a mispelling. So I copied and pasted the URL. <i>Let&#x27;s see where this goes...</i><p>My browser went through two redirects. UBlock origin picked up on both of them. I was curious (and lots of sites have trackers enabled on their funnel entrances), so I allowed both redirects.<p>The page I landed on wanted to install a &quot;Browser Safety Extension&quot; which looked very similar to some CDN portals and to Gitlab&#x27;s browser safety check. The ask to install caught me off guard, so I closed the tab.<p>On trying to repeat the above I landed at the &quot;parked page&quot; of crappy links and keywords one typically sees.<p>So, yeah, someone goofed and there&#x27;s a mispelled URL on the Domino&#x27;s pizza checkout sidebar.<p>Edit:<p>You can go through the process yourself, to see if the mispelling shows up for you: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dominos.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;pages&#x2F;order&#x2F;#!&#x2F;checkout&#x2F;",
