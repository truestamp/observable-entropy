      "text": "I had a contract that ended in late 2019 and that was the last job I&#x27;ve worked. My current resume still shows my freelance experience as ongoing, with the date range of &quot;2015 to present&quot;. At what point should I just cut it off and be blunt with my experience, and tell people I have not worked since 2019?<p>I&#x27;m sure this puts an interesting spin after COVID and that certainly had created obstacles (job openings I applied to have closed mid-interviews). But is it safer today, a full two years later after my contract ended, to just tell on my resume my last job was two years ago?<p>I would like to not scare people reading my resume, but I also do not want to cause people to ask, why is the section so short for 6 years of time. Seems very hard to avoid both issues at the same time.",
