      "text": "I want to setup a camera to record high quality images automatically, the images should captured at various times per day outside, sent somewhere for storage, and it should run for years with hopefully very little input from me. Outside in my situation is at my house, I live in Denmark so in the winter cold, lots of rain all periods of the year. I have some old digital cameras that I could theoretically use (high quality ones but about 13 years old), I also have some cheap gopro-like competitors.<p>Any advice on setting up such a system, projects you can direct me to for inspiration - guidance.  I would like to not go over 1000 dollars but don&#x27;t let the price guideline deter you from making the best suggestion.",
