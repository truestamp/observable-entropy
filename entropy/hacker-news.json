      "text": "I&#x27;ve had a Gmail account since the service was in its early beta and you could get one by invitation only.<p>That was nearly 20 years ago. Over the years, the numbers of messages in my Spam folder grew constantly - last year, for example, there were some 1,000 messages there, waiting for auto-deletion. I didn&#x27;t care, as I very seldom saw one in my inbox.<p>Something must have changed in the past months. Now I&#x27;m getting 3-4 messages per day and those messages are very obvious spams, that even a primitive mid-Nineties filter would have caught. I keep reporting them as spam, but nothing changes - I get the same messages the next day. Even more infuriating, they seem to be emanating from the same bot, as they arrive in my inbox between at ~10am PDT, ~12pm PDT and ~3pm PDT each and every day.<p>How is is possible for Google&#x27;s excellent (until now) spam fighting system to miss out on those ones?! I&#x27;m reluctant to copy&#x27;n&#x27;paste some fragments here, as they&#x27;re so spammy that HN&#x27;s own filter would be triggered and my message would go straight to HN&#x27;s purgatory - but, please, believe me when I say they&#x27;re in the spammiest format one can imagine.<p>Any explanation?",
