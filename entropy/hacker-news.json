      "text": "There was a long discussion on HN the other day regarding why companies are having trouble hiring engineers:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29892437<p>One of the recurring themes is the &quot;leet code&quot; interviews. I will go further and say that any interview that doesn&#x27;t mimic the job is a guaranteed way for me to turn the company down.<p><i>Stop accepting shitty interviews</i><p>When I was talking to trading firms about coming back to the finance industry, about half of them admitted they already use my open-source software. And yet, only one firm bothered to ask me about how some of my stuff was implemented. That&#x27;s the firm I&#x27;m working at now.<p>Instead, I got plenty of firms that still insisted on asking me questions that are not remotely related to the job. Tons of Hacker Rank and Codility, even though I&#x27;ve never had a time limit when building something in real life. Tons of intern-level questions as if I was a college freshman. And tons of detailed questions about how a specific programming language works, as if we&#x27;re going to build a compiler for that language.<p>And to reiterate, those were the firms that already admitted to using my software!<p><i>Stop accepting shitty interviews</i><p>The stupid assessment practices won&#x27;t change unless employers suffer the consequences for this nonsense. I have always made it my mission to reject any firm that asks me syntax questions or brain teasers. (Seriously, the New York Times doesn&#x27;t assess journalists by having them conjugate verbs; it&#x27;s just weird to ask this.)<p>Yes, people get mad when I terminate the interview on the spot. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve been blacklisted from a few places because of my stubbornness. But damn if I&#x27;m going to allow stupid shit like this.<p><i>Stop accepting shitty interviews</i>",
