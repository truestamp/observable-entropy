I tried to file a support ticket but their support desk is also experiencing issues (and I would really prefer to go back to email support, come on GitHub). A number of Twitter users are also reporting similar issues with GitHub Actions. GitHub&#x27;s status page is silent on the matter.<p>Is anyone else having issues? Any GitHub employees around to investigate?",
