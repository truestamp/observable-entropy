      "text": "I have always been interested in the evolution of the nation state and governance and a few conversations (and the release of Balaji&#x27;s new book on Network States) brought me down a bit of a governance rabbit hole and I stumbled back on the Sovereign Order of Malta which is a religious organization for the most part but also still has permanent observer status at the U.N. Are there other such groups that still exist and don&#x27;t necessarily hold physical territory but still are internationally recognized? If so, why don&#x27;t they try to purchase land somewhere and create their own state?",
