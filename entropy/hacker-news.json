What are some things that we, as ordinary people with bills to pay and mouths to feed, can do in our daily lives to contribute constructively towards positive social change?<p>Write a book? Make art? Make music?<p>Study science? Study culture? Research the world&#x27;s problems? Innovate solutions?<p>Be a better parent, spouse, family member? A better boss, employee, colleague? A better friend, neighbor, stranger?<p>Listen more? Understand more? Love more? Take better care of yourself so you can be more present to the world and all the people in it?<p>These all sound great of course, but the key question is, of the ones that we can do, how do we make it significant and concrete enough to matter?<p>For example, how do we make actions like reading books and exchanging ideas on the internet <i>non-trivial</i>?",
