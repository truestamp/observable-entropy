      "text": "TLDR; \nI am a product manager, but hate my job and want to go back to engineering. Should I do this, or loosing all I have achieved in this role is stupid, and I should just continue?<p>Full text: \nI am a software engineer by background, did some machine learning, but during my career I somehow switched to product management. In my first startup, I was in the CTO role, but effectively, I was doing a lot of product related things, so when the startup went bust I decided to proceed in that direction because somehow Product Management sounded more prestigious to me, and I felt like being able to make more high-level decisions will be a much better place for me to focus my time and effort on.<p>Now, almost a decade later, I have worked in many startups in product and product leadership roles, and I am currently in a product leadership position in a very successful company on a breakout trajectory.<p>At the same time, for the past year or so, I feel like I am in a fundamentally wrong role. I understand the value of product management, I can do a lot of product strategy, prioritization and user research activities pretty well, and I know how to coach product managers who work with me, but I feel like I am wasting my time, and I hate waking up for work. I am dreaming about coding, designing architectures, solving challenging tech problems, and spending less time on stakeholder meetings, planning meetings, strategy meetings and sync meetings.<p>Sometimes I am wondering if the problem is that I am just not doing product management right. Maybe in an ideal situation, in ideal company, with ideal product, the role can be much more engaging and satisfying.<p>But at the same time, I can&#x27;t stop thinking that product manager in general is a very artificial role. In a good, empowered and autonomous team I don&#x27;t see why team lead can&#x27;t carry some PMs responsibilities, with some people from marketing (i.e. product marketing manager) carrying the other side of product manager&#x27;s role.<p>Anyway, where I am right now is I am depressed, I don&#x27;t like my job, but I feel scared to lose the credibility and status I have achieved in my current  career direction, and go back to a lower level technical role. I know how to code, and I still code regularly for myself, but it is very different from what companies expect from tech leads or software architects who they hire, so probably I will need to start lower level. Or I just need to start a new startup and be the CTO again :)<p>There is another voice in my head that tells me that I am just lazy, trying to get into comfort zone as product management is not a comfort zone for me, and therefore I should continue fighting and suffering to get out of this stronger and successful on the other end. But I have seen too many people falling into the trap of suffering like this for no good reason, and I want to avoid this...",
