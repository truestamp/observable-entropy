      "text": "Reading code is not an easy task. I&#x27;m irritated or overwhelmed in some situations.<p>For example, a method needs multiple files to trace the flow when reading the code. Start to read line 50-55 in file A and then jump to line 30-40 in file B and then line 5-10 in file C and then... When I face this type of code, I often get lost and forget what to do. So, I&#x27;m irritated.<p>In other case, hundreds or thousands lines of code in a file always overwhelms me. Honestly speaking, I want to escape the huge code in such a situation.<p>What type of code irritates you or what situations you get in trouble while reading code?",
