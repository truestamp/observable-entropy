      "text": "Recently my SO has been complaining about the number of emails she has to send out, keep track of, and the boilerplate that is usually needed. She also has to track time like a lawyer. The company uses outlook for email and I don’t know what for time tracking. I’m wondering what software I can suggest that would make her life easier and more efficient. I hate to see her get bogged down with inefficient software. Any suggestions welcomed.",
