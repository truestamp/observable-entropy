      "text": "A friend who is a psychologist came to warn me about this problem, which I possibly have and discovered only now in my 30s. Reading all over the web, I can say that I have ~ 100% of the symptoms since I was a child: inattentive, daydreamer, unable to follow instructions given, etc. All my teachers in my childhood always complained that I was never paying attention to classes. \nUnless it is REALLY REALLY important (like to turn off the stove), I often forget something I was asked to do if I don&#x27;t take note. Man I&#x27;m just shocked, that I didn&#x27;t have any clue, my whole life, that this was actually a mental condition.<p>Since I&#x27;m now WFH, In my dayly job I&#x27;m just learning to take notes of everything in meetings, because that already lead me to a lot of problems in the nearly past.",
