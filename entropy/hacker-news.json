      "text": "Hello! I just published a book on Site Reliability Engineering.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B09QNZC2LL<p>This book is a collection of 28 chapters on SRE concepts, such as observability, monitoring, Service Level Objectives (SLOs), alerting, resilience and debugging.<p>I adapted each chapter from blog posts I&#x27;ve written over the last 4 years.<p>Most of the chapters detailed concepts that I applied while working at $dayjob, so they are 100% proven in real business settings :)<p>------<p>Some info on the backstory. Last year I started writing a book on my software development methodology. I put in ~80 hours and am ~25% done. I began getting discouraged and I wanted the practice of actually shipping an entire book from start to finish. I took 28 blog posts and combined them to create this book. I put in ~20 hours editing the book myself. I&#x27;m really happy to have this experience and am looking forward to resuming my other book.<p>I used leanpub to generate the pdf and epubs. Leanpub has its own markdown flavor called markua. I was originally drawn to leanpub because it has a pretty popular tech listing website. I didn&#x27;t actually list on leanpub because they only pay using paypal, so I listed on amazon KDP instead.<p>Thank you!",
