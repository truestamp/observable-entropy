      "text": "Two years ago, an issue was opened in Microsoft&#x27;s IntelliCode GitHub repository[0] titled &quot;Licensing issues&quot;. It receives a response from a Microsoft employee. Eventually, the argument is made that this is a derivative work, as it is derived from thousands (?) of open-source projects. From what I understand, this seems to be true.<p>However, here&#x27;s the fun part: Microsoft is training its AI dataset on these open-source projects. Would the terms of the license still apply here?<p>Further, would you say the law hasn&#x27;t caught up with this use of open-source projects yet?<p>I am also curious about the legality of GitHub Copilot, since they seem to do largely the same thing from an AI standpoint.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MicrosoftDocs&#x2F;intellicode&#x2F;issues&#x2F;201<p>EDIT: Intelli<i>Code</i>, not Intelli<i>Sense</i>!",
