      "text": "Roam Research is a popular note-taking app. It&#x27;s hard to say whether it&#x27;s the most popular in a competitive, but it&#x27;s got plenty of loyal supporters as shown by the number of people that suscribed to the 5-year-plan for 500 USD.<p>Recently, their lead engineer left for a YC competitor: Athens Research [1].<p>Is this as indicting as it looks? Or is it common? This engineer was in Roam for less than a year, so I don&#x27;t think his shares were vested, so this is at least a signal that he thinks the shares in Roam are going to be worth less than shares in Athens (assuming equal participation.)<p>I think this is an important question for prospective users, as they&#x27;re making long term investments not only money-wise but also because of data lock-in.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AthensResearch&#x2F;status&#x2F;1414254253124866052",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been an avid follower of YC for a while, looking for cool startups. But man, some of this stuff that the organization is doing is BS.<p>1. They&#x27;re straight up just funding projects that are direct copies of trending projects. I&#x27;ve seen some projects within YC that have not only taken the UI another project with the same concept but have even taken some of the copy. Where&#x27;s the innovation in that?<p>2. If someone has already been to YC less than a year ago, why the heck do they get prioritized over others that haven&#x27;t even gotten the chance at the experience yet? It&#x27;s absurd, I thought the whole point of this organization was to democratize innovation.<p>There are a bunch of other flaws that many of you can point out. But it honestly seems like YC isn&#x27;t focused on quality innovation. It just seems like they&#x27;re funding projects chasing the latest trend and backing founders within that inner SV circle. what are your thoughts?",
