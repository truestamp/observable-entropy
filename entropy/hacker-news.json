      "text": "TL;DR: Do you drink alcohol while you work? How does the drinking affect your work?<p>----------------<p>Under lockdown last year I tripled my drinking. Was working remotely. Still am.<p>Didn&#x27;t really affect my work. I continued to be as productive as I used to be. (I do some coding, some teaching, some investing.)<p>But I took a total break from alcohol for 2 reasons:<p>1. a couple of times when I wanted to drive my car out somewhere I couldn&#x27;t because I was probably over the legal limit (and I never drive with alcohol on my breath).<p>2. I&#x27;m well aware that alcohol in large quantities cannot be good for health.<p>I&#x27;ve now had six months of complete sobriety. The result: my productivity, my drive, my passion for work have gone down. And no, I don&#x27;t crave alcohol.<p>So I&#x27;m going to re-start drinking alcohol intermittently and moderately to see if it&#x27;s what&#x27;s missing.<p>My question for HN&#x27;ers: please share whether you drink alcohol while working, and how much. How does the drinking affect your work. And please also clarify what kind of work you do (e.g. Coding, People Management, etc.).",
