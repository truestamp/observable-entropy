      "text": "Hey HN,<p>Screenshots of bugs are no substitute for reproducing issues, but clearly annotated&#x2F;laid out images do go a long way for developers to understand what’s going on and start working on them sooner. These remain an odd amount of work&#x2F;overhead to do well— no one is going to fire up photoshop here, and most QA folks I’ve talked to have a simple trick or two up their sleeve for assembling screenshots&#x2F;repro content quickly.<p>A friend of mine’s spent the last few years working to improve this process and threw together what’s quite possibly the most functional screenshot tool (on windows) I’ve seen out there, meant specifically for QA teams (one click share to issue trackers, some annotation tools useful there, etc), and I wanted to share it with the HN community on behalf of them. They’ve put in pretty much zero marketing efforts so far and I’m trying to encourage them to get started— I think this could be useful for quite a few people, but other than some surface blog content, this is literally the first public post of their product.<p>There’s a free version (and like, $2&#x2F;mo for premium), it’s my hope some of you can try it out and find it useful. A bit on their product here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pixtel.us&#x2F;product.html, and you can grab a download here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pixtel.us&#x2F;download.html.",
