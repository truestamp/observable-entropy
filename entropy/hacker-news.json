      "text": "Transcendental numbers expand as a series of random, non-repeating digits (think Pi).<p>Assume Alice could find a new transcendental number between 0 and 1. (There are an infinite number of them).<p>Assume Alice and Bob know that number. This is their shared, private key. PRIVATE<p>To communicate, Alice creates a new transcendental number using the private key (for example by exponentiation, or some other offset method). This &quot;offset&quot; OFFSET is the public key.<p>To encode, Alice starts with the private key, creates a new transcendental number using some random offset. Call the new transcendental number PAD = f(PRIVATE, OFFSET). Alice uses PAD as a one-time pad to encrypt the message SECRET = (MESSAGE xor PAD)<p>Alice sends the pair (OFFSET,SECRET) to Bob.<p>Bob uses OFFSET to compute the PAD from PRIVATE. Then uses (SECRET xor PAD) to recover MESSAGE.<p>Transcendental numbers plus offset can generate an infinite set of one-time PADs.<p>Knowing (MESSAGE xor SECRET) recovers the PAD so this in insecure against a known plaintext attack. Knowing PAD then PRIVATE can be recovered. However, if Alice and Bob share a secret method of choosing a new PRIVATE after each communication then they can continue the scheme.<p>The key question is how to find transcendental numbers.",
