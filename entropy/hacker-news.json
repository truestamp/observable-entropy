      "text": "I work for a big startup in LATAM and I&#x27;m running interviews for Engineering Manager positions. It turns out to be very difficult to find good candidates because we are looks for a good mix of very strong technical background, good experience dealing with stakeholders and managing teams. This is not very common and we end up with candidates that are either very rusty with their technical skills and mostly working as &quot;Project Managers&quot; or very technical and have almost no existing experience dealing with stakeholders and teams.<p>A lot of times, I found myself thinking &quot;This person is far from what we are looking for&quot; after asking 2 questions or just hearing the first 5m of what they are doing right now. I thought several times to stop the interviews to avoid both wasting our time and his&#x2F;her expectations.\nBut I always felt if I do that I&#x27;m going to be a bad person and had a bad image. So, I always keep going with the interview trying to find questions to ask, even if I know the answer is not that important for the role, or far from my expectations or just don&#x27;t care about the answer. I just, try to keep them engage with the feeling that I getting what I&#x27;m looking for, when in reality is completely the opposite.\nI also don&#x27;t feel good about this approach. Any advice? I&#x27;m a horrible person?<p>PD1: For sure, we need to improve our pipeline and what candidates are we hunting. It&#x27;s far from flawless.<p>PD2: It never happened that I change my mind after finishing the interview.",
