      "text": "I was discussing with a friend who said she wanted to sell online instead  of selling on WhatsApp (which is primary how most individuals sell online in my country) in order to focus on other things. So instead of constantly posting goods on her status and groups she does it once. \nI know most people may not fit in to that niche but with the increase of so many channels and online marketplaces for selling stuffs how do people manage to coordinate between them all<p>And do you think it&#x27;s a viable idea to build like a platform that enables the seller sell on every channel possible like how buffer connect to the various social media but more towards sellers for selling.\nThank you.",
