I don&#x27;t play video games (which is why people usually stay on Windows) and I don&#x27;t use any commercial software that requires Windows (I&#x27;m not doing web design and the little I do I work with Figma or something similar).<p>I used to work in IT and yes I know I should&#x27;ve gotten into Linux earlier but my job involved Windows workstations and Windows servers. With that said, I don&#x27;t mind if I have to read documentation to get things working because that&#x27;s what developers do anyways.",
