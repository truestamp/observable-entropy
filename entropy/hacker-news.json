      "text": "During Coinbase signup, it prompted me to provide ACH details. This makes sense -- an easy way to convert fiat currency to&#x2F;from cryptocurrency.<p>However, then they wanted me to sign in to my bank account using Plaid. When I clicked the button to only provide regular ACH details (routing&#x2F;ABA and acct number), the website forcibly re-enabled Plaid login as soon as I entered the Bank of America routing number and wouldn&#x27;t let me switch away. This seems like a particularly evil dark pattern just so they could scrape my bank account.<p>As I understand it, Plaid uses your bank login to grab your checking account history (all transactions) as well as sharing this information with Coinbase. Why does Coinbase <i>force</i> this requirement, but only for banks that it knows it can gain access to this data for? What if I switch to a local community bank?<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem that this level of checking detail is required by law in any country, even for KYC, so why does Coinbase want access to this information that isn&#x27;t required for KYC compliance?<p>Is this the privacy nightmare that it appears to be, and are there other exchanges that are more customer friendly?",
