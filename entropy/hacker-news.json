      "text": "FYI, `INSTEAD OF` triggers on views can function like stored procedures in SQLite3.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly the same, no, but you still get to have DMLs &quot;stored&quot; in the DB.  For example, I&#x27;m not sure how to return results from an `INSTEAD OF` trigger (that is, if I write `INSERT INTO &lt;view&gt; (...) SELECT ... RETURNING ...;`, what will be returned?  Apparently what&#x27;s returned is the values of the NEW row, while one might think that if the view ends in a `SELECT` then maybe that would be used as the source for the `RETURNING` (but, no).<p>Even with limitations, `INSTEAD OF` triggers as an approximation of stored procedures is very powerful.<p>You&#x27;d do something like:<p><pre><code>  CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS things AS ...;\n  --\n  -- INSERTs on `things` function like SPs\n  -- where values furnished for columns\n  -- function as SP input parameters.\n  CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS create_thing\n  INSTEAD OF INSERT ON things\n  FOR EACH ROW\n  BEGIN\n      ...\n  END;\n</code></pre>\nand to invoke such a &quot;stored procedure&quot; you&#x27;d<p><pre><code>  INSERT INTO things (...) VALUES (...), ...;\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>  INSERT .. SELECT ..;\n</code></pre>\nThis language is Turing-complete.  You can also loop via recursive triggers.  And you can use `WHERE` clauses (and `OR IGNORE`) on statements in the bodies of `INSTEAD OF` triggers to implement conditionals.<p>Most of this is taken from a comment I just wrote, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31912640 but I&#x27;ve written this sort of thing before elsewhere too, including on the old sqlite3-users mailing list years ago.  I&#x27;m pretty sure lots of you know about this -- it&#x27;s really quite obvious.",
