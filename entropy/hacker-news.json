      "text": "A few months ago I got a new job as a senior software engineer and my engineer manager has asked me to talk about my long-term goals regarding my career. Now, I&#x27;m 30 years old, and my long-term goals (and even my short-term goals for the next 5 years) are not related at all to the company I&#x27;m working for; my goals are not related to any company at all: my goal&#x2F;dream is to have my own small company where I work on products I do care about using sane and boring tech. The only reason I work for companies as a software engineer is: money, learning (although I do learn more and better at my own pace in my free time), and yes, money again.<p>Obviously, I can&#x27;t say this to my manager! While I appreciate learning about new hot stuff like K8s and the like, I find it miserable to work with such technologies. I can handle it, and I&#x27;m productive, but I don&#x27;t think I will be able to handle it when I&#x27;m 40. Also the management path is not for me. I like programming, I appreciate well-crafted software and I like the idea of working on products that are actually useful and respect the user&#x2F;customer (even if that means less money at the end of the day). That&#x27;s why I want to have my own company. That&#x27;s my goal for the next 5, 10, 20 years. I cannot come up with something to tell my manager that is not a blatant lie. I wish I could say &quot;I appreciate your help, manager, but don&#x27;t ask me about my long-term goals. As a good professional all I can promise is: to behave like a professional regarding the quality of my job, being honest and stick to the deadlines&quot;.",
