      "text": "Hi,<p>I’m trying to figure out how billing might work for a potential subscription-based SAAS product.<p>Questions in mind include:\n1. What to charge for? Bandwidth? Storage? Other considerations?\n2. How to collect payment? Is Stripe a good option? What else do I need on the backend?\n3. How much to charge? Expenses + desired profit? Research competition.\n4. How to charge? Establishing tiers seems to be a common practice. Free, Personal, Business, Big, Gigantic. Does this simplify billing? Or is it more of a promotional thing, and establishing a single charge rate is simpler?\n5. What other questions am I not asking?<p>Any advice or references would be appreciated.<p>Thank you!",
