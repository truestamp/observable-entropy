To summarize:<p>- It immidiately attempts to access the clipboard contents after opening<p>- It makes 140 DNS requests to atleast 5 different domains in the first three minutes <i>after closing</i> the app<p>- it makes an additional 50 DNS requests 5 minutes <i>after closing</i> the app<p>- it continuously makes tracking requests in the background after being closed<p>- It requests phone and location permissions immidiately after opening<p>This is honestly even crazier than I expected. I&#x27;ve never seen an app contact this many subdomains even while being in the foreground.",
