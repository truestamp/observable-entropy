      "text": "I&#x27;ve been wondering if there is a simple fix for k8s unintuitive dx. A couple of things I find more difficult than should be:<p>- Deploy a pod, some controller doesn&#x27;t agree. Finding out the controller is a bit more difficult (why aren&#x27;t the controller logs aggregated and share a common saga id&#x2F;key). I understand the evented nature of k8s with its controllers, but still it makes it very hard to trace and debug.\n- Why is it so hard to see _everything_ that is in a namespace.\n- Why isn&#x27;t the YAML typed and so elaborate. Or why can&#x27;t we prefer a typed JS json&#x2F;json5 since the actual objects are JS and adhere to a spec?\n- why are there specs in specs in the templates and templates?\n- Why is it `kubctl (nothing here) logs` and `kubectl get pods`\n- Deleting a pod and patching the finalizers?<p>I know this complexity is somehow needed but it would be nice if the 80% would be easy and the 20% would be possible. When it works it is fine. But when it doesn&#x27;t its an absolute pain.<p>Also 80% of my time goes in the same repetitive tasks. Ideas are welcome!",
