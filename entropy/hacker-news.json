Comments cannot be deleted by the admin, just flagged if they are offensive or do not follow Thonests terms and conditions. This way people know that the conversation is not being altered by anyone.<p>This is a win-win to both the companies and the users. Users can put more trust in a company before making a decision or purchase and companies can gather feedback and answer questions.<p>I would love to hear your thoughts. You can check it out here - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thonest.com",
