      "text": "So, let me preface this by saying that I think it&#x27;s possible to have a healthy discussion on this topic, and I am not trying to be overly judgmental of Substack.<p>But, I am genuinely curious why is it getting so popular and particularly here on Hacker News. Does it have some kind of a hidden feature that makes it very appealing?<p>My number one assumption would be that it uses a global userbase, so people who write on Substack can collect subscribers&#x2F;readers much faster. Is that all there is to it?<p>I also know that Substack prefetches an email address (once you enter it on any Substack-based site) and then plasters it on all their other customer sites, which I _really_ <i>hate</i> about their platform.<p>But I can see the appeal in that, I guess.",

      "text": "I&#x27;m a junior dev that recently joined a small team which doesn&#x27;t seem to have much with regards to tracking requirements and how they&#x27;re being tested, and I was wondering if anybody has recommendations.<p>Specifically, I would like to track what the requirements&#x2F;specifications are, and how we&#x27;ll test to make sure they&#x27;re met? Which I don&#x27;t know if this could be a mix of unit and integration&#x2F;regression tests? Honestly though if this is maybe even the wrong track to take, I&#x27;d appreciate feedback on what we could be doing instead.<p>I used IBM Rational DOORS at a previous job and thought it really helped for this, but with a small team I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely they&#x27;ll spring for it. Are there open source options out there, or something else that&#x27;s easy? I thought we could maybe keep track in a spreadsheet (this to match DOORS?) or some other file, but I&#x27;m sure there would be issues with that as we added to it. Thanks for any feedback!",
