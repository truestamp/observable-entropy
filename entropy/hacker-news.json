      "text": "Hi HN!<p>I&#x27;m trying to help my wife secure some funding for her Ph.D. research. Right now she is splitting time between her funded project, and the project she came here to work on, (one is cell bio&#x2F;tissue growth, the other is space medicine&#x2F;space physiology). They are both interesting, but very different, and she ends up losing a lot of energy shifting gears between the two.<p>The space research is what she is trying to fund, and I suggested that she try the Musk Foundation, as she spent some time working at SpaceX before coming here. Her research is also very relevant to their long term goals, and ticks quite a few of Musk&#x27;s philosophical boxes.<p>After about a year of waiting for her to find the time, I decided to go ahead and draft a proposal for her, haha. It went well and she and her advisor both like it, but we can&#x27;t decide on length. We have a single-page version and a four-page version. They both read like letters, but the four page version looks more like a research paper and includes some figures and tables.<p>The single page is very good for the length, but it&#x27;s a complex topic, and we have no idea what the readers background might be...not much info out there on the Musk Foundation. For that reason, I think the four pager is much stronger, and the first page of it is compelling, but will anyone read it at that length? I don&#x27;t have much experience pitching like this, and would greatly appreciate any advice from the community.",
