      "text": "Hi, I just joined a team, where most devs are really juniors(mostly bootcamp grads who did a career change and got hired after internships).<p>I&#x27;m not that experienced myself but a bit more than them(I&#x27;ve been coding since I was a kid, but don&#x27;t have that much experience as an employee)<p>A part of my job is supposed to be mentoring a few of them. I&#x27;ve never mentored anyone outside of a few students&#x2F;friends in college though(besides maybe one intern I gave a few advices to, but it was really quick)<p>Any advice on how to be useful to them?<p>Should I be proactive and regularly ask if they need help? Or just tell them to ping me whenever they want if they have an issue?<p>Also I&#x27;m sure I could teach them a few things, but I don&#x27;t always feel legitimate&#x2F;confident, I&#x27;m younger than them, \nI&#x27;m not always 100% sure of what I&#x27;m saying, so sometimes I&#x27;m hesitating about giving them advice to not teach them wrong stuff.",
