      "text": "I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone familiar with Canada&#x27;s Startup Visa process, particularly if it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve gone through or considered.<p>I remember a lot of fanfare when it was first announced, and it seemed like an interesting novel approach to attracting startups.<p>Looking at it lately, it seems like a few of the Designated Organizations were almost operating on a pay-for-play model, where it comes across almost like they are charging fees for recommendation letters and then essentially rubber-stamping them.<p>Searching online mostly gives results from Youtube&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;etc posted by companies &amp; lawyers who will help streamline the process, in exchange for another fee.<p>Is this still a viable&#x2F;helpful process for startups? \nAre there designated organizations which are more helpful&#x2F;legitimate that one should consider, or any recommendations of who to avoid?",
