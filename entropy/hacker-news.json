The scope I&#x27;m thinking about is a microservice, maybe in a server maybe on the edge, with a pretty simple code (input conversion -&gt; inference -&gt; output conversion). Appreciated features: strict type system to avoid errors without too much testing, reasonable performance, ease of parallelization, and garbage collection (I find memory management overkill).<p>Some options I have in mind are go, rust, ocaml, haskell, erlang&#x2F;elixir, and scala.<p>What is your experience in these cases?",
