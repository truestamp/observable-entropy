When I make a proposal based on a mockup I feel that it restrains too much the development process, when I don&#x27;t make a mockup the client always feels the need to ask for continual changes to the UI that don&#x27;t fit in the original time estimate. What would be a good way to structure an offer offering minimal leeway to the client, while keeping him happy with a good and precise outline of the features that will be delivered?",
