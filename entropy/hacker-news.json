      "text": "Hello HN,<p>over the last few weeks for an internal project we (CKIN) have been building Korbinsky, an API allowing to retrieve which hostnames corresponds to a given IP.\nComing from a different background (security and embedded software) this has been an interesting journey tackling various techs and we see no reason not to open (a moderate) usage to developers.\nWe have created a key for HN so you can start to experiment without registration (which is of course free and available [0]):<p>curl -v -H &quot;apikey: l86WRM0NC2bBHMfEBQdkhXbDp2BoQw0O&quot; http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ko.ckin.it&#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;ip&#x2F;2620:0:862:ed1a::1<p>of course it works also with other IP addresses :) even the good old IPv4:<p>curl -v -H &quot;apikey: l86WRM0NC2bBHMfEBQdkhXbDp2BoQw0O&quot; http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ko.ckin.it&#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;ip&#x2F;91.198.174.192<p>there is a quota associated to the key so if you intend to build something it would be better to register your own (or ping us in case of different quota needs).<p>thank you in advance for your precious feedback.<p>Best regards,\nCKIN<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ko.ckin.it&#x2F;registration&#x2F;",

      "text": "Although there are countless Android phone makers, there isn&#x27;t a single one of them that makes compact phones. Sony was in the business for a while but it seems to lower the supply of the new models and mark them with super high prices. \nThat&#x27;s very strange as there is clearly demand for smaller phones, shown by the iPhone mini. Apple offers an almost identical compact phone to it&#x27;s regular model, but it seems that phone makers who usually copy Apple on everything, just skip this idea at all. \nIf anyone has thoughts on it or a compact model to recommend I&#x27;ll be glad to hear.",
