      "text": "I&#x27;m an experienced linux user and I tried to play doom 1 today. And for me it was a complete failure. How it has come that it is so hard?<p>There were Linus youtube series [0] about linux gaming. But I was skeptical about it as all games I wanted to play have native linux support. And I didn&#x27;t experience any problems with them at all.<p>But today I wanted to launch Doom 1(which I own via gog.com) and it was a failure. I tried to launch it via wine and dosbox with no luck. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have any <i>.wad files available.<p>I tried to search it via duckduckgo and I came across zdoom [1] and tried to download it. Ubuntu&#x27;s 64bit version is 404 at the moment. 32 bit version requires </i>.wad files which gog.com version doesn&#x27;t provide. And I&#x27;m stuck here trying to play 28 yo game.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0506yDSgU7M\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zdoom.org&#x2F;downloads",

      "text": "I have been searching for a solution to e-sign some lease agreements. It is something that I need to do maybe once a year and the only thing I need is a legally binding way to put signatures and timestamps on a PDF.  I do not need any fancy features.<p>I was doing research, and it seems like most document signature companies all charge monthly subscription fees! This does not work for me as I am not using the platform on a monthly basis.<p>Are there free, open source alternatives to Docusign? If so, why do more companies not use them?",
