I don&#x27;t have any understanding of multiverse theory but I want to define some boundaries about which part of human knowledge is Physics and which is Mathematics.<p>For example, is Probability and Statistics theory only a part of Mathematics or maybe Physicians consider this knowledge from both fields simultaneous? And one really crazy question: is there any possible circumstances (like other reality with other Physics or maybe kind of non-Euclid mathematical framework) which makes Pi non equal to 3.14~ ?",
