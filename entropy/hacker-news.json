I made a typo when trying to visit DigitalOcean, and landed on Vultr&#x27;s website instead.<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitaloean.com&#x2F;<p>I realize it is perfectly acceptable in an open marketplace to leverage all legal methods to maximize traffic to your store. But I would&#x27;ve really appreciated it if there was an interstitial page, visible for at least for a few seconds, that told the visitor that they have mistyped the domain name, and that they are now being redirected to Vultr&#x27;s site.<p>I&#x27;m an existing customer of Vultr, and this experience didn&#x27;t really lift up their image in my mind. Doing the above suggested, or something similar, would&#x27;ve made me like them more.<p>Edit: Addendum: Given that their color schemes are almost identical, and that my password manager auto-filled credentials, I even clicked on relevant buttons to login and almost launched a VM there.",

      "text": "Hey, I&#x27;m looking for suggestions on a book to help relearn some math.<p>I went through engineering school and had to take many advanced math classes, but it&#x27;s been enough years that I&#x27;ve forgotten much of what I had learned. I&#x27;m sure it is not all forgotten, it just needs to be reawoken.<p>I was considering picking up some textbooks, but then I remembered I didn&#x27;t find them all that helpful back then so that is unlikely to have changed.<p>Maybe what I&#x27;m hoping for doesn&#x27;t exist, but it would be great to find a book that does a high level overview of lots of different types of math and relates those to some real world scenarios. I&#x27;ve found this grokking algorithms book which has been helpful but I haven&#x27;t found something analogous for mathematics.<p>If you know of any good books I would appreciate you sharing it.",
