      "text": "This question is geared towards Architects, Tech Leads. DevOps Leads etc.<p>How do you communicate new recommendations or framework changes effectively to developer groups that need to adopt it? I was having a discussion with upper management recently and I came to the realization that the group I am in, doesn&#x27;t perform HumanOps very well. We don&#x27;t sell our code to our customers, the development teams within our company, we want to deal with new tech, bleeding edge changes not with the nitty gritty of framework adoption.<p>We don&#x27;t just jump on bandwagons, but we do leverage technology that becomes available. We try to be within 1 stable release of current versions. The problem is not all developers are like that. A lot of times we create a mostly turn key solution to solve problems, but the  developer groups are slow to adopt.<p>We luck the sales pitch, or marketing slogan internally. How do we do that better? How do we communicate what&#x27;s coming soon? How to adopt the frameworks that make their lives easier?",

But then I get frustrated when she brings up these topics when I&#x27;m heads-down on work. We&#x27;re falling apart here!<p>A specific thing I&#x27;ve failed to figure out is how to control notifications regarding calendar invites - emails just find ways to be missed. I know I can pipe emails into something like Slack, but I&#x27;m wary of trying to sell my wife on a jury-rigged system.<p>Please, tell me what works for you.",
