      "text": "Our small organization has signed a 7-year contract with XXXXX...a fund accounting and CRM provider based on Microsoft Dynamics. Honestly, it has been one of the worst experiences in software. The expense is through the roof at $100k pa which they started charging on Day 1 when we could not even use the system because we need to pay consultants $1500+ a day to help us organize the data. The service levels are poor both in terms of quality of response and response time....once they did not close out an issue because they thought it resolved without checking .with me and then they took months to answer. One reply to a support ticket said the request was invalid without providing a solution. The software provider admitted today that their service&#x2F;support levels are poor. Any one have advice on how to get rebates or money back or a discount on the rates going forwards? Or is it possible to break the contract?",
