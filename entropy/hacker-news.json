      "text": "I want to connect a local system to the Cloud using an extra device like an ESP or Raspberry Pi. What would you prefer? Embedded RTOS (running on the ESP32) or a full GOS like Alpine Linux(running on the Pi 4)? It only has to handle some UART reading, a bit of string modification and a MQTT connection to the cloud. Honestly I don&#x27;t think I need a full blown GOS for that. It also would make the system more complicated and increase the fault surface. Am I missing some points?",

Doesn&#x27;t matter if you assign an app to a screen in a given desktop (with or without a screen plugged in), it will always mess it up over time.<p>(And yes,) I&#x27;m keeping the first screen on each monitor empty (because MacOS merges the first screens of each monitor when the external one is unplugged), but somehow the other apps, with time, will also get into the wrong desktops.<p>I&#x27;ve found a lot of (good) apps to manage the position of apps in the screen (like Rectangle -free and open source-, and Mosaic) but I can&#x27;t find an app that keeps certain apps in certain desktops.<p>(Apologies for the long comment, but the frustration is real.)",
