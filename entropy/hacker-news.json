The ERP does not have an API.<p>To take CC payments, I&#x27;m considering Stripe.<p>Since our catalog changes frequently, i&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a good idea to keep your products synced between the two systems? Or just create a product (e.g. Stone) and use that for all invoices?<p>How do you manage your SKUs if you&#x27;re using Stripe (or any other CC processor)?",
