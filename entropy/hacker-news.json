Western countries are taking many measures to stop the war, but all measures seem to be alike - they all escalate and deepen the divide between the nuclear armed military powers. Meanwhile, innocent people in Ukraine are suffering now, innocent people in Russia are going to suffer soon due to sanctions and I cannot see how adding more suffering to the World is good and is bringing us closer to peace.<p>I wondered if an unconventional approach to trying to resolve the conflict could be of any benefit, so I created:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peaceagreement.org&#x2F;<p>You can see a mock example of a peace agreement here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peaceagreement.org&#x2F;perfect-emblematic-fulfilling-clever-world<p>I&#x27;ve committed $1000 to the best reasoned peace agreement anyone comes up with. If you have geopolitical understanding of the situation and can construct an objective and convincing agreement, please create a new one by pressing &quot;Create new agreement button&quot; on:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peaceagreement.org&#x2F;<p>The app has just been launched and not many agreement proposals have been submitted yet, so the competition for $1000 is not fierce currently.",
