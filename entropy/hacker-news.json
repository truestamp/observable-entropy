      "text": "Last year the redit group WallStreetSilver attempted to put the squeeze on the silver shorters  by buying paper silver. This failed and it became very apparent that the paper silver markets are heavily manipulated through spoofed short sells and derivative quantities of paper silver being traded between the banks to drive spot markets down.<p>Fast forward to this year and it seems there is a new approach to squeezing the market but this time it is being attempted through the hoarding of physical silver rather than paper warrants.<p>Apparently Bank of America has a 300 million ounce short position on silver that is coming due on Jan 30th and there is a belief that the COMEX does not have the physical silver to cover this.<p>So the question is: If the price of silver begins to rise, at what price point do you think it would be worth selling off the heirlooms?<p>PS: It seems the values of antique silver things are already quite high!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifranks.com&#x2F;silver-tea-sets",
