      "text": "Hi all, I&#x27;ve been wanting to create a kind of CRM for myself for a while now. I can setup a relational database with (my)sql and I can query it, but I&#x27;m looking for a simple frontend to create a program&#x2F;app&#x2F;site around that database. Be it python for a console based program or some framework for php css html, it doesn&#x27;t matter. I just don&#x27;t want to create all the input boxes and table layouts myself. I guess I just want something to plug&amp;play.. Any suggestions?",
