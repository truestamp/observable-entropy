My job is technically interesting, and I still learn&#x2F;improve. I do not have meetings. One or sometimes two 30 min calls a week with my boss. Most days, I do not have to interact with anyone from work, not even customer contact.<p>If I knew I could have a job like this ten years ago, I would have thought that&#x27;s it, the dream.<p>But somehow, it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s never enough.<p>I dream about doing my own thing or retiring early to do other projects. It is probably human to always want more.<p>So HN, how did you settle and slow down and become happy with the way it is without always wanting more?",
