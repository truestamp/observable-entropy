      "text": "This, I guess, would be pretty close to, or inclusive of, any anti-sex&#x2F;whatever harassment training.<p>In this case, though, it would actually include training on how to do things like:<p><pre><code>  - how to ask again&#x2F;remind someone of something they said they were going to do for you but have not yet\n  - how to communicate non-violently -- e.g. you would learn _not_ to say things like i heard a jerky coworker tell others repeatedly in the not too distant past, &quot;I already told you yesterday, blah blah blah&quot;.\n  - the appropriate way to deal with situations when they&#x27;re going sideways -- i.e. remain polite, at a minimum, e.g. another recent experience had a co-worker basically going off on a customer because the co-worker was impatient and incompetent.\n</code></pre>\nLots of thoughts behind this, but a couple are:<p><pre><code>  - people don&#x27;t know how to act *even when* they want to act correctly. the world is complicated, we don&#x27;t all grow up in the same cultures, same happy&#x2F;broken homes, etc.\n  - postive reinforcement in small drips&#x2F;snippets, say, at the beginning of each day, can help not only train people properly, but also actually improve behavior\n  - this type of training _could_ greatly reduce worker suffering, whether at the hands of managers or non-manager co-workers\n\n</code></pre>\nThere are a few ideas here, but that&#x27;s the gist of it. It&#x27;s like morality training for the workplace.<p>I think a lot of the School of Life site&#x2F;store&#x2F;school&#x2F;whatever:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theschooloflife.com&#x2F;<p>I think of them a lot because I often think to myself, &#x27;man -- we need a school of _life_ or something&#x27;.<p>And then i look them up again and see how they&#x27;re doing some of the things i think are cool, and some that are less than.<p>but in these times of civil society breakdown, i feel like this type of training could &#x27;help the centre hold&#x27; -- in this case, the centre of the company, or a single worker&#x27;s professional and&#x2F;or personal life (as affected by what&#x27;s happening at work).<p>so, maybe you&#x27;re about to tell a co-worker to f-off, but...your &#x27;keepin it real&#x27; morality lesson this morning told you how to deal with bottled up frustration -- e.g. go chill, take some time, wait until tomorrow to ask&#x2F;say&#x2F;do anything, ask co-worker if you can chat over coffee in the breakroom, break out the non-violence communication skills, talk it over, etc.<p>Benefits would in theory accrue to company bottom lines, worker happiness&#x2F;satisfaction&#x2F;dignity, etc.",
