      "text": "Several months ago, I built a &quot;stealth&quot; feature that I could use. It hasn&#x27;t been advertised, and I&#x27;ve been the only user. As I find it useful for myself, I believe others (software developers) may like it too. So, this is the first public post about it, and if it gets any positive feedback, I may put some time into promoting it more.<p>In essence, given that you&#x27;ve opened a GitHub repo (there are ~225k of the more popular ones indexed as of now), you can replace &quot;github&quot; with &quot;libhunt&quot; within the URL, and you will find the top alternatives and related projects.<p>For example, here are three popular repos:<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rails&#x2F;rails<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vercel&#x2F;next.js<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kovidgoyal&#x2F;calibre<p>To test it out, open any of the examples above and replace &quot;github&quot; with &quot;libhunt&quot; within the browser URL. You can also try with any other repository as long as it&#x27;s a bit popular.<p>I&#x27;d be more than happy to answer any questions and receive some feedback. Thanks!",
