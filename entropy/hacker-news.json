      "text": "The way it&#x27;s presented in popsci (and very often by pros) is that c is a very big number - bigger than any other possible speed - so c^2 must be REALLY big. Therefore a small amount of mass is equivalent to a really lot of energy.<p>So here&#x27;s the question: is this bullshit?<p>The value c is a constant; so c^2 is a constant. That means the equation can be rewritten as &quot;E=mK&quot;, and since there are no units, that&#x27;s the same as &quot;energy is proportional to mass&quot;.<p>Is that wrong? Or is the standard formulation a standard piece of science PR bullshit, whose only purpose was to make people go &quot;Wow!&quot; Did Einstein do science PR?",
