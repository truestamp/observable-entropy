I couldn&#x27;t find a source anywhere.<p>Searching on ebay you find people selling Raspberry Pis at substantial markups.<p>I&#x27;m not really quite sure how much detail is needed to make that newsworthy, or if this was already obvious and known to people, but it seems worth mentioning. Digikey had 52 week lead times, but that could have just been some default.<p>I wonder how much this supply chain difficulty will result in people designing their own computers rather than relying on integrating something like an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi due to being able to repair and substitute things more easily if they&#x27;re lower level.",
