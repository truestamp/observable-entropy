My apologies in advance if it does.<p>With the holidays coming up I&#x27;ll have some free time on my hands and would like to give back something to this community. I&#x27;ve been working as a frontend developer for almost a decade and I&#x27;ve looked at many resumes in that time. I&#x27;ve seen just about every level of quality in a resume and feel like many could have benefitted from having another developer review it.<p>So, if anyone is interested, I’m inviting you to send your resume to the email in my profile and I’ll try to give you some feedback. I don’t have any particular qualifications in doing this type of thing, so keep in mind that my feedback is subjective and not necessarily good advice. Nonetheless, I think there is still value in knowing the impression your resume makes on another developer and I&#x27;d like to provide that to you!",
