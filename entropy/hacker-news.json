The sun on each card also rises and sets accordingly (and the moon comes shortly after). I have also replaced 3 layers of clouds with sort of cloud-shape-like objects. This allows for easier tinting based on time of the day and better depiction of the cloud conditions (few clouds, broken clouds, etc.).<p>Unfortunately, svg animations from the original codepen were quite heavy on the resources, and as I wanted to run this thing on raspberry PI, it was too slow at around 15 FPS. So I reimplemented rain, snow and clouds using webgl canvas with PIXI.JS and also upgraded TweenMax to GSAP 3. That boosted the FPS rate to around 30.<p>Anyway, I am looking for any feedback on this. Does it look good to you? Would you use something like this at home? What other features could be useful on such a board? Do you think it has a market?<p>[1] This is a temporary token that has a request count limitation, if the page doesn&#x27;t show anything anymore, you need to create your own token from rapidapi by subscribing to this API (there is a free plan):<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rapidapi.com&#x2F;faraway-technologies-faraway-technologies-default&#x2F;api&#x2F;dashboard25&#x2F;pricing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rapidapi.com&#x2F;faraway-technologies-faraway-technologi...</a><p>P.S.
