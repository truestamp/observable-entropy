      "text": "Hi, this is a bit of a ramble about what to do with the capabilities that i have been gifted with.<p>I am a senior backend developer with 8 years of experience. Id like to offer my capabilities to a project that aims at improving the &#x27;global situation&#x27; in some way. \nHowever i find that most jobs are not aligning well with such goals. \nInstead, they are often about maximising revenue or increasing sales.<p>I want to know where can i find companies or organisations, that can use my capabilities to &#x27;better the world&#x27; in any way. \nI am currently working in a company that aims to accelerate the scientific process, and i am looking to find similar opportunities.<p>As an example, in the scientific area i&#x27;m thinking of contributing to  projects such as arXiv or sciHub or basically any other project that wants to make a change instead of just money.<p>I suspect that it is not just me, but that there are many talented people around here that could and would contribute to &#x27;improve the world&#x27; but are instead working in lucrative jobs around selling some goods.<p>I think this could should be talked about more, since so many smart, capable people here are just utilised for increasing sales for some company, when we could leverage this resource to better the world?<p>Thanks for reading.",

And how it appears we’re on track to meet that prediction.<p>So it has me thinking: Yes clearly political and social change are needed more than anything. But engineers like me don’t control governments.<p>So what is there that a person can work on which is most likely to have to greatest positive impact on helping the world get past the coming energy, climate and population crises?<p>At the moment I’m working on a robotics project which it is hoped will make fully autonomous mining and manufacturing closer to reality.",
