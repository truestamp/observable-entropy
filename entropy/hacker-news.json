      "text": "Comparing my pre-pandemic (in-person) and current remote working situations, I believe that I would be more productive and creative if I meet regularly in person with my coworkers. Doesn&#x27;t have to be 5 days a week - in fact, a mix of remote and in-person enable important, focused work. Though remote seems to work well for a lot of people, I can&#x27;t help but miss in-person interactions and the spark that they bring.<p>I&#x27;m looking at positions at startups and wish there was a filter for (current or eventual) in-person collaboration. I suspect that this may be the case for others who are on the hunt, so I hope that this thread can be generally helpful.<p>Which companies are hiring specifically for in-person roles? How many days a week are in person? (SF Bay Area roles would be particularly appreciated!)",
