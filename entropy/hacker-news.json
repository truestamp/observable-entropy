Five years later it’s still not launched.<p>Like many people working on side projects I’ve worked on it in fits and starts. I really want to launch it and could use some help finishing the backend, some front end and UX work and deploying. It has a Flask backend with a no-framework Bootstrap-based front end. There are some complexities with data acquisition and integrations.<p>How and where have people asked and received help for their side projects?",
