California and other states have enacted such protections, but Maryland hasn&#x27;t.<p>She is looking for example language from real employment contracts of where the employer claims to own all of the IP of the employee, even for projects created and developed outside of work hours and that aren&#x27;t related to the company. This language might appear in an employee contract in a section title &quot;Ownership,&quot; &quot;Inventions,&quot; &quot;Employee Creations,&quot; or &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; and the section likely addresses copyrights, inventions, discoveries, and trade secrets.<p>Examples from Marylanders or for companies operating in Maryland are especially helpful, but examples from other places are welcome too.",
