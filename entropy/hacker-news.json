      "text": "I had a realization about this a few weeks ago. I know there are serious problems with tech being cis male dominated, pay disparities, harassment and general mistreatment of women, non-binary and trans people are very sadly all too common. I believe that the teams I have been on have treated all team members with respect, admittedly I didn&#x27;t know anything about my teammates compensation so there could have been hidden issues I didn&#x27;t see.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be part of the problem, I want to be elevating the voices of women, non-binary and trans people in these kinds of spaces so we can change the culture of our industry.<p>I would like to hear from of the non cis-male members of the Hacker News community. Do you think the absence of things like profile pictures or a space for pronouns is a benefit of the community? Do you like participating in discussions here? Does leaving gender out of how we identify users, unless they decide to write about it in a post, make posting here more approachable than other communities?<p>I think women I have met have generally been better at identifying the gender of an author and identifying negative patterns in tone, etc. There is a lot of assertive tone in comments, people claiming to know absolute facts even in debatable topics, which I believe has contributed to the problem I have assuming so many voices on the site are cis male.",
