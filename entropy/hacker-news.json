I get a fair amount of interest from startups by posting here in the monthly &quot;Who wants to be hired?&quot; thread, but a month is a long time to wait when a job has become intolerable.<p>Any tips for beating ATS resume filters?<p>I skip and leave blank any section in a job application form that asks for information that&#x27;s included in my resume like &quot;work experience&quot;. Does skipping these invoke the ire of the ATS?<p>I also skip any demographic&#x2F;disability&#x2F;veteran status questions or choose &quot;decline to answer&quot;. I assume there are serious legal strictures against taking those into consideration when evaluating a candidate.<p>How important is a cover letter? Is a two or three-sentence cover letter sufficient? necessary?<p>General online job hunting tips?",
