I have the opportunity to swap to a top of the line M1 Max Macbook Pro for work, but as a 10 year Linux only user have some reservations.<p>Things I&#x27;m excited about:<p>- M1s seem much faster, I do a lot of code compilation so this would be a boon<p>- &quot;Just works&quot;<p>- Better hardware, much better battery life - can actually use a laptop as a laptop!<p>Things I&#x27;m concerned about:<p>- Package management not being first class<p>- Having to learn a new OS&#x2F;new shortcuts&#x2F;etc<p>- Being disconnected from how things run in production. For example, its really useful to run things like Heaptrack locally to track down memory issues.<p>- Docker not running well (maybe this is better than it was in 2021 though?)<p>- Things being similar but different enough that it&#x27;ll be frustrating<p>Have any long time Linux users switched over? How are you finding it&#x2F;enjoying it now?",

As for environmental concerns I don’t think we are any worse the having another country mine the oil and then send it over, in fact the transport costs makes it probably twice as worse in terms of the environment. So why don’t we just start mining for oil again here?",
