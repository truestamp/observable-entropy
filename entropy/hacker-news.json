      "text": "I&#x27;m making a small free web app in Django with bootstrap for frontend for small-size farmers to exchange services in between each others, the app will have no more then a 1000 users. Along the way i stumbled with a lot of problems:<p>* phone version\n* chat in with selected groups of users\n* deployment and security<p>I tried making it in django-rest with vue or using uvicorn and django-chat and even implementing my own chat system but it complicated the whole project a whole lot. Is something like firebase or aws lambda with preact or petite-vue with ionic(for phone version) better for these kind of small apps ? I&#x27;m looking for a different web framework that will have all these things included with minimal code required. I just would like to get it shipped as fast as possible. Do you have any suggestions ?<p>Thanks in advance",
