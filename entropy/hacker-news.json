There are well made email libs for them.<p>2) Very fast and responsive Frontend written in Svelte.<p>3) In-built Opt-In Encryption (maybe through age or pgp?)<p>4) Gracious Free Plan.<p>5) Spam filters must work very well.<p>6) Custom Domains for Paid plans ?<p>7) Email Tags(with automatic tagging too)<p>Are you interested ? Any interesting suggestions&#x2F;improvements you need?<p>Please suggest me , HN",
