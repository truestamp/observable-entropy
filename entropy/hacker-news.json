I want to be like them but every idea I’ve had hasn’t taken off or I’m afraid is in a industry that is too hard requires too much funding. At 26 I feel like if it was gonna happen I would at least have something by now having dreamt of this since I was like 19 but nothing. Idk I just feel like these thoughts are consuming me and I need to let go of this dream for a bit. How can I do this? Any advice?",
