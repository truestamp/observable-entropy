I remember having watched it but for the life of my could not find it again.<p>I did a search in my history and sure enough, NBC has made the video private:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hda3vvmqQHQ\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20220207105125&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hda3vvmqQHQ&amp;t=198s<p>I find it incredible that they&#x27;ve removed this video from public consumption. The event happened, the coverage of the event happened, what could possibly justify removing the video, regardless of any proceeding events?",
