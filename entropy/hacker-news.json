Like, let&#x27;s say there are already some solutions for some problems, \na lot of web&#x2F;standalone UI clients out there.\nFor example, I know managing connectors with k8s can be a problem and existing solutions (like confluent&#x27;s) are not ideal, \nbut not sure if that&#x27;s really a big problem for most of people.<p>Please share your thoughts. Do you have any problems related to kafka ecosystem really bugging you? What could be done better?",
