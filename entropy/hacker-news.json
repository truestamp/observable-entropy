      "text": "My maths isn&#x27;t great, I&#x27;ve always found it interesting but I&#x27;ve never had more than a surface-level understanding of it. I managed to graduate with a computer science degree by learning just the mathematical concepts I needed for the task at hand and I quickly forgot most of what I learned after the exams were over. I&#x27;ve worked as a backend web developer ever since, which isn&#x27;t an field that calls for much in the way of mathematics beyond the basics.<p>I&#x27;ve recently been getting deeper into interests where this lack of a mathematical background is becoming a bit of a problem. I&#x27;ve been interested in machine learning concepts for a while so I looked into linear algebra, I&#x27;ve been interested in signal processing in music so I looked into things like Fourier transforms, the list goes on and I keep running into issues with my poor fundamentals. I just don&#x27;t have a solid enough background with subjects like trigonometry and calculus to understand a lot of what&#x27;s going on in many cases, I can kind of mentally &quot;bodge&quot; things together sometimes but it&#x27;s a very inelegant way of going about it.<p>What I have found quite useful is the kind of tutorials where concepts are given a visual, geometric interpretation which is quite strange as I&#x27;m not usually a particularly visual person. I&#x27;m still running into issues with my fundamentals though, so I guess my question is: assuming nothing more than mostly-forgotten A-level maths how can somebody who works full time build up a solid mathematical foundation so that they can progress to more advanced topics?<p>Thanks in advance.",
