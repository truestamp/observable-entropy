      "text": "As a self-employed senior software developer, I mostly live off selected freelance work, aside from varying income through SaaS products and apps.<p>I get 100% of inbound work through recommendations in my personal network. Because of that, I have never had a rate negotiation, had to pitch my skills or expertise, or bid against others.<p>But, there&#x27;s a huge problem in managing work load:<p>Sometimes, I go WEEKS without a single hour billed. Other times, I need to decline two projects at once because I am still knuckle-deep in another one.<p>Which reminded me of &quot;agents&quot;:<p>I would actually be happy to pay someone a fee for managing this. I published a book a few years ago, and my book agent essentially took care of the pitching, the leads, getting it sold. I &#x27;just&#x27; did the writing.<p>The TV agent model seems to be even more applicable. You have &quot;preference on work, clients, scale and scope&quot;, and they try to fill up your unbooked time with projects that match. For each booked gig, they charge a fee.<p>Does that exist? Would that be possible? The main argument against it seems to be developer hesitance against out-of-network clients (and risk), and the agent over-promising on both ends to make the deal happen.<p>Sites like UpWork don&#x27;t really solve this (for me), because I don&#x27;t want to compete just on price and star ratings. Every client is happy with the work, attitude, communication and my price, but if I had to compete with a 100,000 developers out there who charge 1&#x2F;10th of my price, it&#x27;ll be tough (clearly a first world problem, I know, I know).<p>Just curious how you do this. I am trying to cap freelance work at 50% of my week, with most projects being &lt; 6 months.<p>I partially worry what would happen if my network stops delivering work, and I already worry about managing the inconsistent volume coming in.<p>Like, a load balancer for project work.
