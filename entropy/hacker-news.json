      "text": "Yesterday I had my 3rd &#x27;tin foil hat&#x27; moment with my iPhone and although these were spread out over some time, I find it very hard to believe these were coincidences.<p>Long story shortish... yesterday we were sitting around the table enjoying our Easter lunch with extended family.  Someone else was mentioning a new family at their church and I caught the first names in passing.  At first it didn&#x27;t click but then I said, &#x27;oh are you talking about X &amp; Y Smith?  They used to go to abc church and lived in our neighborhood briefly.&#x27;  Turns out they were.<p>Fast forward an hour or so and the kids were playing outside.  I took a picture of a friend pushing the kids on the swing and went to send it to the friend.  I pressed send, Messages and typed out the first 3 letters of her name.  The Messages app showed 2 &#x27;autocompletions,&#x27; the friend I was intending and the woman I had mentioned an hour before!<p>- the 3 letters that I typed were NOT in the &#x27;Y Smiths&#x27; name!\n- my phone was in my pocket when I uttered the name\n- I am pretty sure I only said their name once, but could have said it twice\n- I have not sent &#x27;Y Smith&#x27; a text in at least 4 years\n- I have not called &#x27;Y Smith&#x27; in at least 4 years\n- I was shocked I even had &#x27;Y Smith&#x27; contact info in my address book\n- I have &#x27;hey Siri&#x27; turned OFF<p>WTF?!  How is this possible without the device selectively listening for random words and matching against a profile that includes my address book?",
