      "text": "From my personal experience, Reddit.com is full of bugs. Right now, I&#x27;m trying to write a reply and copy some quote. The quote is getting copied like thrice upon doing it once. CTRL + backspace is deleting words like a thresher gone haywire. Every now and then, my karma count fluctuates. Sometimes it&#x27;s even 0.<p>I really didn&#x27;t want to write this here and defame a site but I am really bound. People from Reddit Inc., if you&#x27;re seeing this, please do something about it. Really it&#x27;s taking me a lot of time trying to write a reply. I&#x27;m not saying this happens all the time when I open reddit but that&#x27;s the point, I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;ll go haywire. It needs fixing.",

      "text": "Hi HN!<p>So this all started out as an experiment. I wanted to test the Golang gomobile library to build a small app on Android in Go. And it turned out to be a game, and harder than I thought...<p>After a lot of work and many gotchas (and a lot of moments where I was about to give up and started to squint on Unity) I finally manage to create a working game for Android with Go.<p>The game is quite simple and if it wasn&#x27;t for being written in OpenGL&#x2F;OpenAL from scratch it would be quite simple to make it in Unity or any other game engine for that matter.<p>Another goal of my project was actually to make something that I could sell but still keep open source. I usually never sell anything, I put up all my spare time projects as open source projects on my Github page. Even if it doesn&#x27;t sell I can now at least convince my mother to try it with a single click in PlayStore!<p>Anyway, I might be a bit biased, but the game is quite fun!<p>Sponsor my new beer drinking hobby: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=go.lang.bintris<p>Or check out the source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Lallassu&#x2F;bintris<p>Thanks for your time and have a splendid day!",
