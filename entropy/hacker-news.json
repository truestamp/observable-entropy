      "text": "Tried this before and got instantly flagged, so trying again. For the record, this is NOT illegal in my country and any contract that prohibits it is NOT enforceable here. Do your homework before you hire abroad! Don&#x27;t get pissed because you don&#x27;t understand the law in the country you try to get &quot;cheap&quot; workers from, because we WILL take advantage of your ignorance, guaranteed! Here goes:<p>I live in Ecuador with my wife. She recently got a remote developer gig through a US Silicon Valley company. They pay about $2K a month, but the work is insanely easy. She averages about an hour a day in meetings and I average about 20 minutes per day of coding to squash her tickets. I want to replicate this with people who can talk their way through a standup, but maybe don&#x27;t have the skills to actually do the work very well. In other words, where can I find bad developers who can talk tech and are down to have one or more jobs where they juggle meetings? If I could find a few such people, I&#x27;m very certain that I could bank much more money than I ever put away in the US or EU for far less actual work and hassle. Does anyone know if this has been done by others and maybe how they got it going?",
