      "text": "I am looking for good references on software design&#x2F;engineering principles that I can implement personally and for my team of statisticians.<p>I am a physicist by training, and have created some questionable code and programs as part of my PhD. I am currently a &#x27;data scientist&#x27;, at a research center and manage a small army of statisticians. For the most part most of the coding is hacking together different scripts in a stats software of choice to do analysis. Overtime  our analysis is getting more sophisticated and complex, and would like to implement some better coding practices to eliminate a lot of common bugs and to make our work more sharable. I will also most likely be looking for another job in a year or two, and would like to improve my practice as well.",
