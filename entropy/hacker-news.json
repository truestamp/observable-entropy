      "text": "I’m a mom of two young daughters and I have used my Facebook account mostly for work, and to communicate with my family, some of whom are now deceased. I have never pushed or broken Facebook’s rules or uploaded obscene images.<p>On Monday my account was suspended because someone broke into my account and uploaded prohibited images and then also used my associated bank card to make a fraudulent purchase of £200.<p>I had 2FA enabled so I have no idea how someone managed to access my account. I am not a techie.<p>My bank has refunded the £200.<p>Facebook won’t even tell me what I am supposed to have done nor will they unsuspend my account.<p>The most I have got is that 27 of my posts go against the community standards on nudity or sexual activity - which is nonsense because I am just a mom using FB to connect with family and friends. I am not a porn star and I don’t upload such images.<p>I am so upset because I have so many memories on the account with my Grandma and Grandad (both deceased), photos and videos of my two young daughters growing up, as well as many others.<p>I sent my ID to FB and have not heard anything more. I feel scared that I have sent my ID to someone that has somehow hacked my account, used my bank card, and now knows more about me than before.<p>I feel violated because of this and now Facebook won’t even listen to me.<p>I am sure that a human at Facebook would be able to look and see that I didn’t do this. If they checked the IP addresses used if they just used common sense to see what has happened.<p>Please, I am desperate, does anyone have any advice on what I can do next?",
