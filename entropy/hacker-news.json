Currently this is &quot;Learning how to ride a bike&quot;, &quot;Log4j: Between a rock and a hard place&quot;, &quot;How to train your decision-making AIs&quot;, &quot;Carolina Gold was once the most popular rice grown in America (2019)&quot;, and &quot;Packaging for instant coffee made out of seaweed&quot;. It seems to follow the story, e.g. the first one was #12 before and now it&#x27;s #13, and the numbers 12 and now 13 were colored darker. They do not have in common a recent&#x2F;old submission time, high&#x2F;low score, or high&#x2F;low comments.",
