In some countries it&#x27;s cheaper to dump waste in a river or directly in the ocean. We need to stop this.<p>How would you design a system that guaranties all trash ends up in a proper landfill?  Remember, people don&#x27;t want to spend money on it. So the costs have to be part of the overall plastic life cycle not just the end.",

      "text": "I have had a lot of trouble focusing on work, and I think it has something to do with severe burnout from software engineering.  Nothing feels new or fun anymore, I dread working for a company and writing the same four programs every day, and as a result my performance at work is suffering. I would like to transition to something else (ideally research), but doing so would be a substantial pay decrease, at least initially.<p>I have a mortgage I need to pay and cannot really afford a pay decrease, and I don’t know how to transition careers as a result.  This has led to a feeling of being “trapped” in my current role, with no way to escape.<p>Has anyone here successfully transitioned careers without it destroying their life? Are there any tricks to ease the monetary pain?",
