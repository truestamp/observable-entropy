A good excuse to learn about contact card formats (vCard, MeCard).<p>So here it is: you can generate QR codes using the online form, and embed SVG&#x2F;PNG QR codes wherever you like (Website, Markdown, Slides, GitHub README).<p>The app is FOSS and code source is on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rclement&#x2F;business-card-generator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rclement&#x2F;business-card-generator</a>",
