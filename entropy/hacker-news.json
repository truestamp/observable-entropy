      "text": "We&#x27;re about to receive a mil in funding. It&#x27;s a &quot;cool&quot; startup, as in it&#x27;s trying to solve a hard problem with a still to be completed hardware solution that also involves a lot of trendy (deep learning and more) software.<p>I had a discussion with the two cofounders where they confronted me for not being engaged enough. They have a point.<p>I&#x27;m only moderately excited about the product and the problem space. And I don&#x27;t enjoy working with my cofounders very much.<p>I am the most experienced (they&#x27;re basically newgrads). Part of what annoys me is their inexperience (leading to bad decision making, while not listening to common sense advice). At the same time I feel we do complement each other well because we are quite different personality wise, and it&#x27;s possible that as they mature the issues I have will go away.<p>I&#x27;ve invested 9 months of ~25% work. It feels crazy to leave when we&#x27;re about to get funding, and where I don&#x27;t actually even have to fully commit as I&#x27;m parttime at officially 20% supposed to go to 40, and me going fulltime is not being asked for. I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;m being a diva, I have a habit of dropping people the moment things aren&#x27;t going well. Maybe creating an ambitious new product does require people that wouldn&#x27;t hang out normally (diversity is good blabla)?<p>At the same time there&#x27;s other things I&#x27;d also like to do. And why should I invest more time working on something I&#x27;m not excited about, and with people I don&#x27;t look forward to seeing?<p>I knew what was gonna happen in the meeting, so I had planned some stuff to say to smooth things over because I thought I should try and stay. But when it was pointed out that after a recent major milestone I hadn&#x27;t posted anything on any social media, it made me think why I am I working on something that I don&#x27;t feel the urge to share with anyone? My instinctual  answer is because we&#x27;re very far from having a good product, but I feel that&#x27;s not good enough. And so I just said I need to think about it.",
