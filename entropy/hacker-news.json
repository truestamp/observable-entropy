Even just for the meaning of\nthe word, inside the Constitution the word\nnever appears, and outside the\nConstitution there is weak consensus.<p>So, now all emotional adjectives are\nrelevant in SCOTUS decisions?<p>If &#x27;egregious&#x27; is relevant, can we argue\nabout it?  We will have to argue about all\nadjectives?<p>So, now to understand the Constitution, we\nhave to argue about vague adjectives?<p>Second problem.<p>SCOTUS logic:<p>(1) Roe would make the Mississippi law\ninvalid, that is, overrule it.<p>(2) Roe is flawed in its reasoning.<p>(3) Therefore Roe should be overruled, and\nit follows that the Mississippi law has\nnothing wrong with it and should stand.<p>So, we are to conclude that any law that\nRoe would overrule should be okay and\nstand?  So, to make some radical, absurd\nlaw okay, just be sure that Roe would\noverrule it?  That is, everything that Roe\nwould overrule is okay?<p>That is, we now have a way to make any law\nA legal:  Pass law B that is obviously\nunconstitutional but explicitly outlaws\nlaw A.  Let the SCOTUS strike down law B.\nThen by this SCOTUS logic law A must now\nbe okay!<p>Hmm.<p>Third problem.<p>&quot;The Constitution makes no express\nreference to a right to obtain an\nabortion, and therefore those who claim\nthat it protects such a right must show\nthat the right is somehow implicit in the\nconstitutional text.&quot;<p>So, except for what is in the\nConstitution, explicitly, implicitly, or\nvia the 14th Amendment, there are NO\n&#x27;rights&#x27;.  In particular, states can pass\nany laws they want to take, that is\nrestrict, any &#x27;rights&#x27; they want.  So,\nstate by state, the rights people have are\nsubject to the results of the &#x27;democratic&#x27;\nprocess in that state.  In particular,\nrights are subject to the &quot;tyranny of the\nmajority&quot;.  Hmm.",
