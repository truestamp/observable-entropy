Not opinionated at all.\n7. Fedora: dnf is really slow. You need to google software you want and it leads you to some random blog to add some random repo.\n8. SUSE: terrible documentation. Most useful threads are either in German or french.\n9. Any other distro: not mainstream enough to find solutions for softwares that I need.\nWhat should I do? Seriously. I just need something that take care of me, so I can do my work. Is macOS the only option here?",
