      "text": "After moving to a new country and position, I&#x27;m surprised how often I&#x27;m greeted with this question. Maybe it&#x27;s cultural, but I find it extremely superfluous, especially in a work context. It signals a very cheap understanding of care: a standard one-shot catchphrase one can use to measure mood and happiness. Whenever I mentioned this everyone defended it saying &quot;I don&#x27;t use it in the _classical_ way, I actually mean it&quot;. If someone would actually care, one could ask something specific about the person (what game you played last time?) even without knowing background (what did you do in this nice weather?).<p>Is it just me who is annoyed by similar conversational generics - do I expect too much of small talks?",
