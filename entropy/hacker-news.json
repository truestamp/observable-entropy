      "text": "Awhile back - maybe 2-3 months - there was a comment thread that was somewhat focused on COVID vaccines. It might have been one of the threads about the pause in JJ or AZ vaccines.<p>In that thread, someone shared a link to a site they built. This site was a simple interface that compared the risk associated with getting a COVID vaccine against random everyday risky things.<p>For example: “You’re more likely to get struck by lightning 3 times than get injured by the vaccine”. (Or something similar).<p>I ask because I’ve encountered vaccine hesitant acquaintances who don’t believe the conspiracies, but still feel very worried about the risk, even if that risk is vanishingly small.<p>Humans seem pretty bad at assessing personal risk, and this site seemed like a clever way to bring things into context.<p>Only problem being…I apparently did not bookmark it.",
