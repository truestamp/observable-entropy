      "text": "A few years ago, skeuomorphism was wildly popular. From Windows XP, Vista, 7 to iOS (before v6) and android.

Google introduced Material and Microsoft offered Metro and later Acrylic (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;apps&#x2F;design&#x2F;).<p>But now we see some trends like in iOS that show that designers are embracing some of the intuitive aspects of skeuomorphism. For example, iOS icons have some depth now and look more 3D.<p>Why is this trend happening?",
