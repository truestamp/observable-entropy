It used to suggest things once per quarter tops, that was fine.<p>HN, what private alternatives to Alexa may exist?<p>For example, does anyone make a system that&#x27;s relatively polished and operates entirely in the home, with no audio sent to the cloud? I&#x27;d be happy to run a hub&#x2F;box for the system.",
