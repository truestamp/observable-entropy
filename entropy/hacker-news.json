It&#x27;s probably a good year to shop early, so I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has a good suggestion for gifts for kids? Not necessarily tech-related, but things that aren&#x27;t widely known but have been really good gifts.<p>My son is almost 11, but if you have suggestions for any age I&#x27;m sure someone will be interested.<p>Thanks!",
