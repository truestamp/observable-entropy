      "text": "I&#x27;ll be graduating with a Master&#x27;s in control systems and looking for opportunities related to autonomous driving (motion planning &amp; control) or robotics (mobile robots, multi-agent systems).<p>Background: I have prior work exp, and worked on many projects (pretty basic, not something complicated) related to these fields. I have been coding with C++ and Python for many years now, so I guess I can call myself a beginner with programming. I haven&#x27;t formally worked with algorithms or algorithm design though.<p>Question: How can I find an opportunity in these domains, given my qualifications? Right now, I see a lot of vacancies which have insane requirements (PhD or 3+ years of <i>relevant</i> exp, a master-of-all skillset, etc) even for entry level positions. Is this how it always was? People who are working in robotics&#x2F;AD, how did you guys do it?<p>PS: I live in the EU, if it helps.",
