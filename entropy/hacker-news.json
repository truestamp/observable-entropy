      "text": "My goal: run N Ubuntu VMs on a MBP M1 using either host-only or bridged networking mode. On my previous Intel MBP I was using Vagrant and Virtualbox as provider. This worked wonderful. Now, as you may know, Virtualbox doesn’t work anymore on M1s. I looked around at alternatives, and the panorama doesn’t look good as of now:<p>- qemu. Quite versatile. Works with hvf and it’s fast! Sadly, it doesn’t support yet advanced network modes (bridged, host-only) for mac. There exists unofficial patches that implement vmnet (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;qemu-project&#x2F;qemu&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;465#note_824941037) but they are unstable and require running qemu as root<p>- UTM (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mac.getutm.app&#x2F;) also works fine, but doesn’t offer advanced network modes for multiple VMs (it relies on qemu behind the curtains anyway)<p>- vagrant + vmware fusion. This is the most promising one. But vmware fusion for M1 is still in “tech preview” mode. Also it’s unstable (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;sbailliez&#x2F;f22db6434ac84eccb6d3c8833c85ad92)<p>- docker. Not really a replacement. I need to replicate cloud environments locally (so I need VMs running systemd. The VMs themselves may run docker)<p>Anyone else in the same boat?",
