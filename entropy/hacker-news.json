      "text": "Hi friends! I&#x27;ve always found CMSs a challenge in the past, whether hosting them was painful or they cost a ton. No fun :( I wanted to make a CMS that was a little more fun and that you could use for a couple of minutes and then have the job done :D So I built Berowra: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;berowra.xyz (named after my grandparent&#x27;s home town).<p>First up, I built Berowra on Deta Space. The CMS will run in your own sandboxed &#x27;personal cloud&#x27; in Deta Space, without the need for maintenance by yourself, for free (the best part IMO). You can directly view &amp; access the data Berowra stores through Space, which gives you a nice look into how it all works. I think that hosting Berowra on Deta Space strikes a nice balance between the benefits of a self hosted CMS and a hosted CMS, which I&#x27;m reallly happy with. I used Flask &amp; Python to build the backend and then plain old HTML with some Tailwind tossed in for the frontend :D<p>Here are the key parts of Berowra:<p>- Content is stored in collections to keep things nice and organised\n- Seven different data formats available: string, date, number, markdown, colour, string array and files!\n- File hosting for images, videos and more\n- A well documented API that is organised and supports filtering<p>I&#x27;ve open sourced Berowra at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sampoder&#x2F;berowra and would love to hear what you think about Berowra! This is probably this biggest programming project of mine, it&#x27;s been a journey for sure!<p>Thank you :)",
