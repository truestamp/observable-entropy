Now I have to spend another semester to finish my master&#x27;s, possibly 2.<p>I may fail my master&#x27;s because I can&#x27;t replace a course and I don&#x27;t believe that I will be able to pass it. It seems that there is a mental barrier preventing things from &quot;clicking&quot;.<p>I am tired. I can&#x27;t seem to be able to catch a break or rest. Besides my master&#x27;s I have a job that&#x27;s 30 hours per week because I don&#x27;t have any other form of economic support.<p>I can&#x27;t seem to be able to recharge my batteries. Nothing seems to work.<p>I wake up tired. I have trouble with executive dysfunction. My brain feels saturated, as if there is no more space to store new information.<p>I have reached a point of total burnout. My gears are grinding instead of spinning and I have no strength to keep going.",
