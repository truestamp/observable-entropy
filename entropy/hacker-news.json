      "text": "It&#x27;s darned difficult to make a new and fresh word puzzle app, in today&#x27;s heated word game universe, but my kiddo and I tried, and this is our take.<p>1. The Stage - A box. Words popping out with missing letters. Ominous looking tendrils peeking out from the top<p>2. The Goal - Keep your words from going off the top.<p>3. Your Moves - A moving buffet of random letters to choose from, and the riskier strategy of moving letters between words (ProTip: That way lies Mt Doom), and Hammer Time to help you squash those stuck words.<p>That&#x27;s it! No ads, no tracking, no coins, no weekly subscriptions to get more vowels; Just words - coming at you like a horde of wilderbeast.<p>Developed by me, and PMd by my kid, who drove me mad, in a loving way (you haven&#x27;t lived until your 1st grader cries on seeing your memory graph going the wrong way), but we got to the finish line, and here it is...<p>Would love your feedback",

That is, reduce data science reliance on data engineers in mature data organizations.<p>While living between both worlds of software engineering and data science, we have seen a lack of mature organizational tooling for data scientists. Data teams either require embedded data engineers or companies are forced to find a unicorn full-stack data software engineer to hire. On top of that, the tooling that does exist in this space does not take into consideration good software and infrastructure practices that most high performance software engineering teams require.<p>We are looking for interested teams to join our beta!
