Smart pointers are often used in high-performance code (like browser engines) so it is interesting to learn how their usage impacts the generated code.<p>Here is a simple function that adds two numbers using smart pointers. Rust compiles it into two instructions [1], while C++ creates about 100 instructions [2] including unnecessary memory locks.<p>I wonder, is there a way to improve C++ code so that the smart pointers get optimized out? Did I make some mistake that prevents optimization?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;godbolt.org&#x2F;z&#x2F;YqYK3sPdd<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;godbolt.org&#x2F;z&#x2F;bMrhTsjxz",
