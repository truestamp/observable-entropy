      "text": "Hi everyone. I&#x27;m a random guy based in Munich who got accidentally wealthy and thus lost my drive for pretty much everything.<p>After my Bachelor in CS I launched three startup, which all failed. So a year ago I decided to enroll in a Masters program at LMU at the age of 26. Back then I was living quite on the edge and thus was very motivated to ace my studies to get into a FAANG company.<p>Around the same time I also invested all of the ETH I had at the time into an ICO, which turned out quite well for me. In early November I sold everything and after taxes I now own 7.5 million euros. A sum I would have never imagined.<p>I have no idea what to do with the money. And I also have no idea what to do with my life now. I have not talked to anyone about it but I start to feel fatigued, even though I am not doing much. My motivation for my study is gone, I stopped working out, stopped reading books and am basically becoming insanely depressed in the process. The covid situation is not helping much either.<p>I am posting this here because I think there might be founders out there who sold their company and experienced the similar issues afterwards. How did you get out of this? What can I do?<p>I am still doing my Master studies and will finish it within the next three semesters but I worry to fall into a void afterwards.",
