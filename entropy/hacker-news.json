      "text": "I think there&#x27;s a lot of contention in a lot of mainstream conversation (esp Twitter) between web2 and web3 critics. I&#x27;ve also found that a lot of times we&#x27;re always talking around each other and operating with different frames of reference. What I would like to see is some attempt at finding mutual ground to set the stage for actually productive conversations.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear how someone might try to defend the proposition opposite the one they believe in. In other words, web3 critics comment on why web3 is great; web2 critics comment on why web3 isn&#x27;t that great. Maybe part of this convo is around how to properly define the two.<p>Hopefully this isn&#x27;t too pointless of a question&#x2F;exercise; but if you do find this interesting, I would definitely like to learn more below.<p>Also, since there&#x27;s no way of really checking, I guess it&#x27;s more of an honor code that you try to make a case for the proposition you oppose rather than the one you support.<p>Thoughts?",
