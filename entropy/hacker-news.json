      "text": "Has anyone tried setting up an open source license oriented around the idea of &quot;it&#x27;s free if you are savvy enough to compile a binary, otherwise here you can pay for a pre-compiled binary&quot;? I feel like this could be a very interesting option for solo developers who want to monetize their open source work but want to keep things free for other developers and&#x2F;or people willing to spend 5 minutes reading documentation on how to build the project.<p>This would also encourage non-developers to dip their toes in a development environment which would be an undeniably positive thing for the community.<p>Anyway was just wondering if at any point someone tried to set something up like this. I&#x27;ve been toying with adopting a model like this for one of my popular open source projects that has a _lot_ of non-programmer users and would benefit from increased participation from users in the open source process.",
