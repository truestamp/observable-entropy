      "text": "Relevant context: I&#x27;m 28, live near Philadelphia, PA, I&#x27;m single, have no degree (dropped out 40% through a non stem degree), have been unemployed since December 2019, and have little coding experience. I have a serious disc injury in my back which limits the type of jobs I can work. I&#x27;m also autistic and do much better with technical things then customer focused. I&#x27;m totally ok working in a team though! I currently live with family, which is not ideal but not terrible. I have been thinking about doing a coding a coding boot camp (specifically Launch School using their deferred payment) or alternatively learning Python with the goal of finding a entry level remote job. I currently make zero dollars a month and my savings is quickly disappearing.<p>And here&#x27;s the actual question part.. Do you think this is a good plan? Do you have any advice? My long term goal is to find a get a degree in biology or neuroscience, I think the technical skills from coding would be a great asset in those fields. Finding a remote job is more urgent to me then finishing a degree because because I want to be able to pay for healthcare stuff that isn&#x27;t covered by my insurance (medicaid) and move out of the small town I live in. I previously lived in a large city with roommates before my injury. Maybe I&#x27;m putting the cart before the horse here. Id much rather go the coding bootcamp route then take out student loans. I think I would do better with learning in a structured course then with just my Python textbook. Thank you for reading!",
