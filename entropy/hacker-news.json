      "text": "For the last two years I have been a DevOps and AWS cloud architect at a FinTech startup in Europe.<p>I have just been offered to take on a project which would consist on transferring ~300M EUR worth of customers from a partner to our company as a Project Manager.<p>Previously to being a DevOps, I was a Cybersecurity consultant for a Big4 company for two years.<p>As I am still 27 years old and I have always having dreamt of joining a FAANG company and&#x2F;or starting my very own startup, I am unsure whether this opportunity (which looks like being a project coordinator) would be positive to my CV in the tech world especially in non-european countries such as the USA. Although I have the feeling that I&#x27;d love the job, I am afraid this would be the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; for a short tech career.<p>How did you guys face this kind of situation? What would you do?<p>Thanks for your feedback",
