      "text": "Before acquiring Twitter, Elon Musk said: &quot;The intent is to retain as many shareholders as allowed by the law for a private company, which I think is around 2,000 or so. We’ll try to bring along as many shareholders as we’re allowed to.&quot;<p>How could we best estimate what number of shares one would need to be held to be in the top 2000 shareholders of Twitter? Could we assume a normal distribution of share ownership?<p>According to Yahoo finance, there are 799M shares outstanding. According to CNN, the top institutional shareholders are as follows:<p>The Vanguard Group, Inc (82,403,665 shares)\nMorgan Stanley Investment (64,722,431 shares)\nBlackRock Fund Advisors (36,536,143 shares)\nSSgA Funds (36,363,324 shares)\nAristotle Capital (20,112,134 shares)\nFidelity Management (17,112,059 shares)\nClearbridge Investments (16,733,505 shares)\nGeode Capital Management (14,314,021 shares)\nNikko Asset Management (12,467,698 shares)\nNikko Asset Management Americas (10,297,193 shares)\nMore data here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;market-activity&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;twtr&#x2F;institutional-holdings<p>And then of course, you have the individual shareholders like Jack Dorsey who owns ~18,000,000 shares.<p>tl;dr What is your best method for estimation and estimate for the number of shares required to be in the top 2000 shareholders of Twitter?",
