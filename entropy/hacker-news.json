      "text": "Seems like a support question, but it&#x27;s more than that.<p>Currently, WhatsApp allows users to export chat history in a .txt file for the latest 40,000 messages only. This limitation is rather arbitrary and annoying. Regarding this, I have two questions:<p>1. Is there <i>any</i> way to export my entire WhatsApp chat history, without rooting my Android phone?<p>2. Is this limitation even legally allowed? In other words, is WhatsApp legally obligated to allow me to export my entire chat history, under GDPR&#x2F;CCPA&#x2F;etc.? I&#x27;m guessing maybe not since this data lives on my device in encrypted sqlite files, and not on their servers. Am I right here?",
