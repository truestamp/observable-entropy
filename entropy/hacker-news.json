      "text": "Over the last years more and more people complain that Apple has too much control about which apps are allowed in the App Store. That their reviews are bad. That they take too much from your money. And so on.<p>In the very beginning of the iPhone Steve Jobs preferred Web Apps over installed apps. As we all know they changed their mind in favor of the App Store. But it’s still possible to develop and use Web Apps on iOS. So why there are so few?<p>Apple can’t kick you out and they can’t take your money. Two keypoints of criticism so far. Are there other limitations?",

      "text": "This is coming from a place of ignorance. It&#x27;s not a challenge to the status quo because I think I&#x27;m smart. But a dictionary attack starts with a list of common passwords and applies them successively to the same username, correct? So why doesn&#x27;t the authentication framework just add a heavy cost to the IP address for each failed attack?<p>For example, add a 1 second penalty preventing the code from logging in on failure, then a 2 second penalty, a 4 second penalty, and so on? If it were me struggling to remember a password I&#x27;d barely notice, but if it were automated code running it would quickly become infeasible.<p>My only guess as to why this doesn&#x27;t work is that IP addresses are actually network addresses, which means that if everyone in my building is on Comcast then everyone would in the building would be prevented from logging in. But that doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense because ad tracking mechanisms are brilliant at fingerprinting individual machines, which means a authentication code could use a similar strategy, right?",
