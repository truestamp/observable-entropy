      "text": "Back in the day, I was a programmer, and I use to get hired in a day, sometimes over the phone, etc. It always seemed to work out fine.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that I haven&#x27;t bounced early from a position -- just that, I haven&#x27;t been able to spot any discernable difference in the success rate of a hire based on the length&#x2F;intensiveness of the hiring process.<p>Potentially with one exception -- if I feel strung along by the time it&#x27;s over, I&#x27;m going in with a grudge. That can dissipate very quickly if all things are semi-normal at the new gig, but how often does that happen?<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the hiring timelines have stretched out from say 1-2 weeks to 6-8 weeks. I assume that is because I&#x27;m older, because the industry has changed, because the positions I&#x27;m applying for are not quite as cookie cutter as &#x27;sr. java dev&#x27;, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think the longer, more-everything hiring processes have resulted in better results, if by better results we mean a match that is mututally beneficial for myself and the company.<p>I try to stick to contracting for this reason, but if the perm gig is there, and it seems fine, I&#x27;ll take a chance, why not?<p>I&#x27;d probably prefer if more startups hired on a contract-to-hire basis, so we can try to rock and roll for 3 months, and if it sucks, we part ways, no problema.<p>But if that type of situation exists or is evolving, I have not heard of it.",
