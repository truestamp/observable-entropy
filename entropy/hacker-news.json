      "text": "Hey HN!<p>Recently, I&#x27;m thinking a lot about &quot;practical software freedom&quot; as branded by GNU Guile (aka. &quot;customize and extend while running&quot; + self documenting&#x2F;live introspection).<p>I really understands how cool that can be when it&#x27;s done well, and I see many successful project doing it this way (Guix, and Emacs obviously, but also outside of LISP world there is awesomewm and many others).<p>I&#x27;ve already tried integrating Guile in some hobby projects written in other languages, so I understand how it works, although I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis.<p>On the other hand, most of the time I&#x27;m using (and tweaking) programs that are extended and configured externally through IPC (e.g. sockets, d-bus), like i3 or NetworkManager. I&#x27;m  more familiar with running helper programs (or a front-end) that I wrote in the language of my choice with a library, using d-bus discoverability features when available or after reading some documentation.<p>I often hear that this second way is &quot;only almost as powerful as having a real programming langage built-in&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure I understand why. I realised I don&#x27;t really know the practical pro and cons of each way.<p>From where I stand, I see three main advantage of the IPC&#x27;s way and none for Extension Language (sorry) :\n- It&#x27;s language-agnostic, at the reasonable cost of writing libraries (vs the cost writing and maintaining e.g. a Lua-&gt;Scheme compiler like Guile&#x27;s folks are doing)\n- It can be extended remotely through network\n- When using d-bus almost everything is standardised and runtime cost is <i>never</i> an issue (at least from what I&#x27;ve seen so far in 10+ years).<p>Obviously the reason why I&#x27;m seeing things like this is because I never had the opportunity to learn the advantages of the Guile&#x27;s way, so... I&#x27;d like to learn some bits from you :)<p>I know there&#x27;s a lot of enthusiasm here for LISP-related tech here, so if you feel like proving me wrong and explaining me why the extension language path is better, I&#x27;m all yours!<p>PS: I really don&#x27;t want to start a flame war lisp vs not-lisp or d-bus vs not-d-bus, I&#x27;d like the conversation to stick mainly to IPC vs Extension Language. Thx!",
