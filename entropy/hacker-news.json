      "text": "Hi, everyone. I got big flood last week. Weather was crazy and water got to my company warehouse. Luckily company local server was not in that room. Of course I was to lazy to set up any automatic off site db backup. But now I got it working. I wanna hear you thought? Is it smart to use email for db backup or should I just upload it to remote server?<p>For those lazy like me, try to setup this app and give it a go.",
