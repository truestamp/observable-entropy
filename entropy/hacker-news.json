Is there some process to get out of the purgatory, or to check what caused it, or even only a way to confirm it&#x27;s effectively the case ?<p>I am asking here just to understand from others experience. And I am just wanting to know what I should know, nothing more ( I don&#x27;t think it warrants more than that).",

      "text": "Having just recovered from COVID got me thinking: how do I make sure, that my family can continue using all the systems I have set up and am currently maintaining for them? How do I hand over my digital presence (the one that matters) to them so they can decide what to do with it in case of inevitable event of discontinuity of my life some day even when I don’t expect it to happen any time soon.<p>Having a software engineering background and curiosity to trying things out, I have, over the years set up several systems partly hosted by myself, or in the cloud, for myself and the family. Custom domain name for email, hosting for some family, home network with backed up storage, etc. I realised that no one besides me knows how it all works - and I think it would be unfair to expect them to learn it.<p>I am thinking to simplify it drastically now, but then many things seem to cost a ton if I let it all be managed by service providers for each family member.",
