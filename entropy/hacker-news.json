Then, as soon as I show it to some &quot;seasoned&quot; people (I don&#x27;t know them too well, just strictly professionally) they tell me that I&#x27;m just building a feature.<p>This always stings me, because I end up shelving the project. I&#x27;ve done this a few times in the past, and years later I still don&#x27;t see the type of product I&#x27;d put together in the wild.<p>Can someone with startup experience tell me what people actually mean by &quot;don&#x27;t build a feature&quot;?
