      "text": "I am in the current session of Hack Reactor. Galvanize has basically removed all Hack Reactor branding from the instructional content.<p>Hack Reactor no longer offers any in-person courses or an SF campus.[1]<p>There appear to be about 30 students in the course, in the entire Western US (not just CA). They literally can&#x27;t fill sessions. The internal Slack is completely dead.<p>Worst of all, the material so far hasn&#x27;t been updated in at least 10 years, judging by the dates on the latest commits. We&#x27;re learning early 2000&#x27;s Doug Crockford-style JS. I wonder if the rest of the course material is like this, too.<p>The course still costs ~$20K.<p>Is Hack Reactor basically dead? Are there any Bay Area bootcamps that are a better deal and offer industry networking or employer contacts?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackreactor.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shift-to-remote-software-engineering-education",

      "text": "Background: We&#x27;re a bootstrapped company with monthly revenues in the $4,000&#x2F;mo. range. We want to grow, but both of us have full time jobs and cannot dedicate time to sales.<p>We thought of two options:<p>1. We can raise $200,000 from a potential investor who approached us, and that would give us the funds to hire one or more salespeople<p>2. We can look for a third cofounder, offer them equity (e.g. 20% ownership) and put them in charge of sales<p>I suppose there&#x27;s a third option, which is to wait longer until we have more cash in the bank before hiring a salesperson, but we consider that the slow approach and are looking for a faster way to grow.",
