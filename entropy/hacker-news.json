      "text": "It&#x27;s bugged me for a long time but it seems so much of the working world is filled with sloppy, poorly done jobs. Maybe not the tech jobs and other higher-paying jobs, but definitely the lower-paying jobs where people are only concerned with fulfilling the most minimal of duties. It&#x27;s understandable of course, so I don&#x27;t blame the <i>people</i>, but I&#x27;m still quite bothered by the lack of attention people give to their work. My guess is that it has to do with our culture&#x27;s increasing obsession with speed and &quot;efficiency&quot;, rather than quality of work. And it&#x27;s impossible to take any pride in your work if an organization&#x27;s bottom line is speed, so much so that any attention paid to quality can become detrimental. Amazon comes to mind, but I see it in many other companies, small and large.<p>Do you observe this as well? Is it a trend, or has it always been like this? Are there ways to restore pride and quality in people&#x27;s work?",
