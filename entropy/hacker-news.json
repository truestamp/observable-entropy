There is no interesting tech behind them, and they can potentially steal or con people out of their money.<p>Stuff like this could drag the site down. How did these survive?",

      "text": "Just hit three months at a new full remote startup I joined.  The job provided a nice 30% pay bump from my last job, decent benefits and seemingly cool work based in Elixir (which is what I&#x27;ve been working on the most over the past two years).  However, after &quot;ramping up&quot; they aren&#x27;t even using elixir for beam and the work is wholly un-interesting.  Curious if I should stick it out or go back to leetcoding &#x2F; interview grind and land something new for the beginning of 2022?  I&#x27;m 27 with 4yrs experience and what&#x27;s scaring me is that staying here would make my engineering rigor &#x2F; ability worse.  New job would need at least a 20% bump from my current comp - also considering actually taking the plunge and going for a faang &#x2F; growth stage.<p>Any advice or recs for hybrid work startups &#x2F; companies in NYC are also appreciated!<p>cheers ;)",
