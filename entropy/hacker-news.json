It has always been a prepper talking point to include precious metals but recently I have noticed this become one of the most frequent topics being brought up in chat channels.  Most likely this is due to the current inflation numbers but personally I don&#x27;t want to end up at the end of the line waiting to buy TP ever again.<p>I think it is possible that many preppers have accumulated their hordes of food and firearms and are now looking for something else to add.<p>In any case, I think it is prudent to acquire a small amount of silver given the current low prices.<p>Does anyone have a good reason to not buy a stack or two of silver, is it any better or worse of a gamble than crypto?",
