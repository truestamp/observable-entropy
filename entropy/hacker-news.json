      "text": "This is an Android Live Wallpaper that displays the percentage of your life that has already gone by. Being constantly reminded that life is finite will force you to think about how you spend your time.<p>The inspiration for this wallpaper came from the article &quot;Your Life in Weeks&quot;[0] by Tim Urban. From the article: If you multiply the volume of a .05 carat diamond by the number of weeks in 90 years (4,680), it adds up to just under a tablespoon. Looking at this spoon of diamonds, there’s one very clear question to ask: “Are you making the most of your weeks?”<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;life-weeks.html<p>Play Store: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.machinerychorus.lifeprogresswallpaper<p>Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethanmdavidson&#x2F;DeathProgress",

      "text": "In my last project, I was struggling to create and monitor cron jobs.<p>So, instead of creating hundreds of standalone scrips and executing them with cron, I decided to turn those scripts into multiple endpoints. Next, I created a single service that I could schedule HTTP requests to those endpoints and monitor its execution. No more scripts, now everything is endpoints that I can run manually at any time<p>I turned this scheduler service into a Micro-SaaS so you don&#x27;t have to build it yourself: beew.io<p>I know you can Schedule HTTP requests with Zapier but come on... I will not pay 50 bucks for that hahahaha<p>btw, feedbacks are welcome.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beew.io",
