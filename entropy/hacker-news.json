      "text": "Though any book on compilers or computation will make some reference to grammar (defining terms such as regular vs. non-regular), it is often in passing. I&#x27;m interested in a deeper dive. I believe a lot of the terminology we use comes from Chomsky, but his own books seem to be focused on humans and language learning.

Oh, and while I&#x27;m being wishful, one written in layman&#x27;s terms.<p>Is there a &quot;Grammar as it Relates to Computing for Dummies&quot;?",
