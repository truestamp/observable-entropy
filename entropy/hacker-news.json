      "text": "I was just thinking about how difficult and expensive it is to get a review. How could a blind review of manuscripts, independent of journals look like, would this be relevant for accelerating research progress. Someone like Ramanujan faced a lot of difficulty in being accepted in the Mathematics community until GH Hardy welcomed him and saw his genius at Cambridge. The use-cases I am thinking of are people who might be out of the academic circle, perhaps at a startup, high-school, sabbatical or a pseudonymous collective like Bourbaki.<p>Other advantages are , we could be able to find a way to hack the PhD program with this approach, meaning people who are not at colleges could demonstrate their abilities in a particular topic and can be awarded a PhD by an independent institution.",
