      "text": "I have been struggling this problem since early 2020 (ever since WFH was enforced). I work as a software developer and I find it immensely\ndifficult to get much work done in the mornings. I usually wake up around 8 and after coffee, moderate exercise, shower and breakfast I start my work around 10:00. Apart from the daily stand-up (which happens around 11:00) I find it extremely difficult to be energetic and focus\non my work during the morning session. As day passes by and after a short nap around 12:30, I become energized and am able to focus and\nwork in a productive manner. Till that time I find it harder to be energetic and do anything meaningful. I do sleep well (7-7.5 hours)\nand I wake-up without an alarm.  The place I work from is well ventilated, gets abundant sunlight, and is quite silent.<p>I tried different things to keep myself engaged in the mornings like: skipping breakfast, taking a short walk after the breakfast, making an\nhourly plan of things to work on the previous night. But nothing helped.<p>Essentially I am not able to focus and work for a few hours in the mornings. However to keep up with my commitments I work late into the evenings, and end my work day somewhere around 8 or 9 p.m and on somedays end up working after dinner too . This essentially cuts me out of many things I enjoy (or like to do): learning new things, reading (tech, and non\ntech), watching a nice movie&#x2F;episode etc. I don&#x27;t think my initial inertia&#x2F;tardiness in the mornings is because I find my work to be\nboring, as I like my work and in the afternoons I am able to do my job with a good focus. I also tried to do my readings, learnings etc. in\nthe morning, but I find myself unable to feel enthusiastic about them in the mornings.<p>I am looking for any suggestions to help me do better. Have any of you find yourself in similar situations, and has any life hacks, tips\nhelped you to do better ?<p>Thanks in Advance",
