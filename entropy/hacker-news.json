      "text": "As downloading and using 3rd party dependencies is as normal as writing code nowadays, it feels like the process of reviewing said dependencies has fallen out of fashion.<p>Normally (or &quot;back in the day&quot; rather) you&#x27;d read through the code, see if it&#x27;s of &quot;maintainable&quot; quality in case you&#x27;re gonna have to fork it, see if the code quality is at least average, the author being consistent, having good tests and so on.<p>But today I see people just pulling down fresh 3rd party dependencies just because their peers are using the same ones, or going by number of GitHub stars to see if it&#x27;s OK to use.<p>If you&#x27;re reviewing dependencies before using them, what kind of things are you looking for? Is there something obvious that would immediately make you reject the dependency outright?<p>If you&#x27;re not, do you go by some other metrics or even feelings to understand if it&#x27;s OK to depend on this dependency or not?",

I can manually check every incident to see if there is any correlation between those events, but you know... this takes ages.<p>Do you have any other suggestions?
