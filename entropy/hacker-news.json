      "text": "Hi!<p>I&#x27;m currently an Eng Manager in a FAANG (total current comp is high end 6 figures). I&#x27;ve been approached to join a startup as a co-founder on an area that&#x27;s really close to my passion.<p>Money is not an issue (there is funding and even it there wasn&#x27;t, I have enough buffer to hold for at least a year and not change anything on our life style).<p>What I&#x27;m looking for is advice from people that did the jump from Big Tech to startup and then went back to Big Tech: what went wrong? what are the things you would&#x27;ve done different? What did you regret not doing?<p>I&#x27;m obviously thinking, if I do the jump, do it and not burning bridges, by helping find a replacement as much as possible and leave the teams I support setup for success.<p>I&#x27;m thinking that if for some reason the startup goes to hell (there&#x27;s always a risk there) I could still go back to Big Tech because tbh I do enjoy it here, but I&#x27;m also really interested and actually miss a bit the startup scene.",
