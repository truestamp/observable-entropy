      "text": "Hello HN!<p>I’m a career language instructor —17 years!— that has used shadowing exercises (i.e. teacher says, students repeat) throughout my career to train for pronunciation success. About a year ago, I decided to build a product around this to help students prepare for their IELTS (a language proficiency exam used for university admittance and immigration purposes). So far, the product has attracted lots of signups and positive feedback, which I find reassuring.<p>I’m very interested to get valuable HN feedback, particular on the UX of my project. I have never been good at UK design, and I worry my presentation here is confusing to navigate. This is a Podia-based project, so I’m trying to wrap my presentation around Podia’s powerful but somewhat rigid framework.<p>What do you think? Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ieltsspeakingblog.com&#x2F;<p>(I’m aware you can’t see what a paid account holder would see, but is navigating the landing&#x2F;free content intuitive?)<p>Greatly appreciate your time and feedback!",
