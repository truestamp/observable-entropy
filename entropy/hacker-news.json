      "text": "The current ep. of JRE is #1772 Randall Carlson.<p>I found it fantastic, and I think HN would be interested in it.. but I came to a theory I want to post, based on listening to every podcast this guy has been on.<p>I personally love to look at mountains and thing about how they were formed.<p>---<p>I think that water was on earth a lot earlier than has bee postulated.<p>I think the earth formed very smoothly and the source of water hit the planet (comet?) - but created a very thick ice shell around the water - and as the planet solidified and vulcanified the ice liquified and caused huge interactions with the landscape, on the scales that Carlson talks about -- and it seems that as the earths core heated, a very large meteor swam hit the earth (as well as the moon) and the many impacts caused volcanism plus exploding and melting the ice, and forming the major mountains and then the alluvial erosion..<p>Carlson estimates this type of event happened 3 times. But I think it happened earlier, MANY MANY millions earlier - as these huge cataclysms would have not allowed for the evolution of species - due to the fact the evolutionary track it obv billions of years, which required lots of water.<p>I believe the major impacts occurred billions ago, and the impacts helped crack-the-egg and create the tectonic plates.",
