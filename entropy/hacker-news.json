      "text": "Specifically, I live in a residential neighborhood in a moderately sized city in Minnesota.<p>I&#x27;m willing to go as far as to start a WISP if I can get enough community support; but my question for the telco HNers is this: what specifically drives the decision to burden the consumer with a significant cost? I can understand if this parcel were somehow drastically outside the ISP service area, but I am certain that isn&#x27;t the case as I have personal friends within .5 miles that have 1-gig service.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t the ISP benefit from investing by expanding their available service, given most of the lines (AFAIK) around here are aerial, pole-to-home.<p>Anyone have advice or ideas on how to get reliable fiber to my community?",
