The item sent by Samsung is only a 1TB SSD ($109.99). In plain English: Samsung charged me for a product advertised as containing 8 terrabytes of storage capacity and costing $816.19, but they sent me a product containing only 1 terabyte of storage capacity and costing $109.99.<p>They are refusing to issue a refund.
