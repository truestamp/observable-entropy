      "text": "Full disclosure - I&#x27;m making a ToDo application as a rite of passage as I approach 10 years of teaching myself to program (thanks Peter Novig).<p>These ToDo features make me feel bad:<p>1) Ever expanding lists that put me in a defeatist mindset and distract me from what&#x27;s urgent and important...\n2) Analysis paralysis when prioritizing.<p>I like to track all the things. Currently I&#x27;m using WorkFlowy to record every thought and whim worth writing down, but it&#x27;s becoming unwieldy and distracts my thoughts when I start down branches to enter some new information.<p>When it comes to prioritizing tasks, I can never seem to feel like I&#x27;m doing the right thing at the right time and maybe that says something more about me than the application, I&#x27;m quite the idealist and more of an inductive than deductive reasoner. I have to have a &quot;why&quot; in all I do.<p>Perhaps one solution is some kind of anti ToDo application that just keeps tracks of what you did and reminds you of your moral compasses, and maybe holds you to them in some kind of peer pressure way based on your public commitments? Or maybe it&#x27;s just straight social altogether? But then help vampirism...<p>I&#x27;ve seen other applications that outsource management consulting which I love, and am toying with the idea of using an AI or some kind of moral compass mechanism, but tbh that kind of scares me - like I don&#x27;t want to train some soulless machine to dictate to me what I ought to be doing, morally. Maybe I&#x27;m over thinking this. Maybe I should just do some stupid MVC ToDo app and let it grow cobwebs on GitHub. Penny for your thoughts - I want to at least make something that&#x27;s enjoyable.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve never used Twitch before other than seeing them on youtube, but I&#x27;m starting to get more curious about using it as a platform for engaging with an audience and&#x2F;or building a community etc..<p>I&#x27;m not a gamer and won&#x27;t be using it for that. I&#x27;m still not sure what <i>I</i> want to use it for, and that&#x27;s why I wanted to see how your experiences are with this, what kinds of live-streams you watch or know of, what topics, what format, using what types of features?, etc. And also why people even watch live-streams?? No judging, just curious because I don&#x27;t do it myself.<p>I&#x27;m also clueless as to how I would go about actually <i>starting</i> it. &#x27;Cause it&#x27;s not like youtube where I can clean up a video and present it and share it etc etc. Clearly when I start off there&#x27;s no audience? So I&#x27;m live-streaming to myself? Feels so sad haha. Is it normal to share this afterwards? How does one attract an audience?<p>Sorry for all the questions! Of course I can just start exploring Twitch myself but it&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother world and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be nearly as wide-scoped as asking on here.<p>Thanks!",
