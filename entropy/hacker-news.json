      "text": "We recently received an SBIR Phase II grant, and while there&#x27;s not money for new employees yet, it&#x27;s got me thinking about how I&#x27;m going to onboard our first technical hires (currently just two founders, one technical, and a CEO).<p>As our codebase has been developed over close to 10 years under one developer, it&#x27;s acquired a lot of cruft, and also uses technologies that are fairly dated now. We&#x27;re planning to do a rewrite of the codebase with our OEM partners, and I&#x27;m deciding what to do about the legacy code.<p>Do we:<p>- Take what architecture decisions worked and use the corresponding documentation to develop a new design?<p>- Transition the code base slowly from legacy to new (and hence inform the new hires how the legacy code works)?<p>- Start completely from scratch and retire the legacy code before bringing the new hires on?<p>We&#x27;re going to have about 18 months at a minimum from the first hires to having a product in hand to bring to market.<p>I want to avoid using people&#x27;s limited resources on technologies that I know we&#x27;re going to retire, and just want to see how best to go about that.<p>How have you handled this transition in your experiences?",
