      "text": "I&#x27;m only speaking from my experience, but we shipped things quicker and were better received, and I&#x27;m curious if part of that reason is that, for the first time in my career, product didn&#x27;t start with a background in the target domain. I wouldn&#x27;t say this area is simple either. We deal with a lot of features on the merchant side of things (ecommerce).<p>I also don&#x27;t doubt a lot of other factors came into play, but I want to focus on the product&#x27;s background for a moment. One thing that stood out to me was that there were less arguments to push for something just because it&#x27;s been done in other software for the past two decades. Which very well may be true, but uncertainty pushes my current PMs to investigate.<p>It&#x27;s almost like we&#x27;re starting from a blank slate and only adding the essential parts. They do take cues from other existing products, but I love how their attitude defaults to challenging them. We&#x27;re also fortunate enough to have good relationships with our clients in order to validate our ideas. But we&#x27;re not letting them lead the direction of the product.<p>Because that&#x27;s what I feel sometimes with PMs rooted with deep domain knowledge. What we&#x27;re building is being designed by a customer. This not only has the potential to make it less user friendly (UX designers feel less empowered to challenge them because the PM has relevant background while they don&#x27;t), but it cascades down to the engineers with the amount of work that&#x27;s been added.<p>I won&#x27;t dismiss that that a PM can have both a background and release good products. But why do certain companies make it necessary for *all* PMs to have such backgrounds?",
