      "text": "I have an idea for an I.O.T project to detect whether or not a door is bolted (not just closed), but I&#x27;m struggling to choose an appropriate sensor. Additionally, I&#x27;d like it to be wireless (and battery operated) so there wouldn&#x27;t be any cable management to deal with.<p>I did a quick prototype with an inductive proximity sensor which didn&#x27;t work well, and looked into reed sensors. Any recommendations?",
