      "text": "Transcribing is hard and slow, speech-to-text transcripts are uncomfortable to correct in usual text editors.<p>Transcriptor is a pseudo-modal editor for transcribing. This modal nature is optimised to accelerate the correction of speech-to-text transcripts. This optimisation was based on a statistical model we created for the most common speech-to-text errors weighted by the time it takes to correct them. Transcribers that have been using it have told us that it makes transcribing faster and more comfortable.<p>It’s possible to encrypt the transcripts while still allowing to share them with collaborators, it&#x27;s also possible to use local recordings without uploading them to the server. This makes Transcriptor ideal for working with sensitive information.<p>We’ve created a short-lived link that allows to try it in demo mode. www.inopinia.com&#x2F;sharing-companies&#x2F;transcriptor&#x2F;4pz2jVzGA2m3wg<p>Finally Transcriptor is the first project of “Sharing Companies” a different take in the sharing economy where companies share so people profit instead of the other way round. You can learn more about it here www.inopinia.com&#x2F;sharing-companies. We want to release several other projects in the coming months that will also be part of this initiative, if you are interested on following this you can write to us at info@inopinia.com. We are also looking for NGOs to collaborate with :)",
