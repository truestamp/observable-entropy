      "text": "Chrome mobile is one of the only apps that laughs at you (via :D icon) and it also accumulates other slowdowns as your tabs accumulate.<p>Tabs are useful though, and can represent a lot of research cost in terms of time, and also organizational energy. A lot of people use Chrome for work, and rely on the tab functionality as part of their day to day work.<p>But it seems like large numbers of tabs are clearly an internal issue for Chrome mobile that make it a worse experience, such that this must be communicated to users via emotional cues and other unwanted side effects.<p>So why doesn&#x27;t the app offer to save your tabs to a Google Doc for you, before closing them and placing the doc link in the tab dialog?<p>Or something else?",
