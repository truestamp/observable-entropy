We help to set up short paid calls with your favourite micro creator (10k-50k followers on instagram) using our platform. You can choose times that the creator is available and arrange the call. The best part is you don&#x27;t have to prepare for the call, based on the creator&#x27;s theme (comedy, lifestyle, fashion) we create conversation topics to break the ice or laugh about.<p>We are on a mission to open up the creative industry to everyone. We want to make it so that anyone can create great content with someone they admire.<p>We&#x27;re in private beta so if interested please comment",
