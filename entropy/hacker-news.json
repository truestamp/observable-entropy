      "text": "Hi, HN.<p>I was struggling to get a color palette right for a small game I was making in Unity and decided I&#x27;d throw together something that gave me a few dials to play with. Naturally, when the proof of concept worked I began expanding it and then some every time I wanted more independent control.<p>It was initially born of frustration of not being able to do certain basic things in Photoshop, like invert HSV values independently. And if they were possible they were usually cumbersome.<p>Anyway, It&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job for me for now. So given that color related content seems to be popular here - and I&#x27;ve never contributed a piece of software to the world - I thought I&#x27;d upload it to the web &quot;as is&quot; for free and perhaps someone else might find it useful. Any feedback is appreciated and if there is enough demand I might continue working on.<p>Thanks for your time.",

      "text": "I love building and working - always have, always will. I&#x27;ve been programming for nearly 10 years, 5 of those professionally but the industry is literally destroying my soul and it has recently become crippling.<p>I&#x27;ve been in all kinds of jobs, from start-ups to massive corporate companies. I&#x27;m forever building my own side projects as I love it, as well as love the idea of making my own living but as you all know, side hustles don&#x27;t make money over night.<p>I&#x27;m currently in a great job. By great job I mean, the money is really good, there&#x27;s room to grow and the opportunities are endless... Yet I can&#x27;t bare it. I can&#x27;t bare the devs that go out of their way to work weekends without being asked, I can&#x27;t bare the endless meetings, constant micromanagement, bringing the stress home to my family.<p>I don&#x27;t know where or who to turn to. Can anyone relate?",

      "text": "We recently released an online course. [1] It&#x27;s $29, but we&#x27;ve had users saying, &quot;I&#x27;m in {poorer country than USA}, and I can&#x27;t afford the $29. Do you offer regional pricing?&quot;<p>I would like to support this. The dollar-value to a customer in India is probably lower than in the USA.<p>Most big platforms (Udemy, App Store, Play Store) seem to solve this with a price tier matrix. They maintain a big table of prices per (tier, currency). The tier comes from the product, and the currency comes from ... the user&#x27;s IP address? (See example matrix [2])<p>To build this from scratch, I would have to:<p>* Define a list of tiers, each with a hard-coded USD price.<p>* Maintain a list of Purchasing Power Parity multipliers for each currency. For example, regularly scrape OECD data.<p>* To get a tier&#x27;s price in currency X, multiply by the current PPP.<p>* Somehow clamp the prices to &quot;appealing&quot; values, so we get e.g. £25 instead of £24.19.<p>* Ensure we never make a loss after subtracting Stripe fees!<p>* Detect a user&#x27;s location. Presumably using IP. Map location to a country, and country to a currency.<p>* Probably many more things I haven&#x27;t thought of.<p>This feels like a generic problem that I shouldn&#x27;t be re-solving myself. So, questions:<p>* What libraries&#x2F;services can I use instead?<p>* How do you do implement localized pricing?<p>* Are there complexities that explain why there&#x27;s not an out-of-the-box solution?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32118530\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;udemy-images&#x2F;support&#x2F;Udemy+Price+Tier+Matrix+-+EN+09-17+Matrix.pdf",
