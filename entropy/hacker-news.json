I use it for maybe 5 minutes every few days (no notifications so I only login when I remember), and I see some interesting posts from people I like, press a couple of hearts and a retweet here or there.<p>Because I get to choose who I am following and it’s relatively impersonal so I don’t feel obliged to reply &#x2F; acknowledge the message and so forth. The benefits of one to many communication.<p>So I wanted to ask if this was a general trend and more people are enjoying Twitter, more in a relative sense in comparison to its own history and in comparison to its peers in social media.",
