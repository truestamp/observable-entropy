      "text": "Why does my brain refuse to turn off? What purpose is my brain if cannot preform such a basic function as turning off. How is it that my consciousness never seems be repressed. The moment consciousness is programmed to go out from the chemical hormones and biological systems, my consciousness is there to interrupt this. I give up on believing that my conscious thoughts and actions have any effect on whatever unconscious errors that unpredictably malfunction because of what? Genetics, stress, idk. How can I reset this brain and let it do one of its most basic functions that for some reason decides to not work regardless of any activity, hormone, sleep quality, circadian rhythm. I give up and am reporting an issue with my brain or the DNA replication that failed when i was born or something.",
