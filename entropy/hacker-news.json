      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m looking if any of the solopreneurs or small shops (5-10 people) could give some insight into their CD.<p>Do you practice CD, and if so how?<p>I run two unrelated Django monolith applications, which serve me very well. I use CircleCI for Continous Integration, and it works well enough. The benefits of CI are of course muted if one is rolling completely solo, however I&#x27;m bringing on another dev this year so that&#x27;s fine.<p>Where I get lost is CD. Right now I still manually ssh into the VM and pull latest changes, run migrations and install any new dependencies, compile static if necessary, etc. etc.<p>How can I reliably integrate CD into this small application? Would Ansible be a good solution?<p>A key obstacle for me are the migrations. Is it best to migrate your DB completely separately? Test any migrations before hand and commit the migration scripts as well? It&#x27;s uncommon but not out of the question that I need to manually edit a migrations script to massage the database back to a state it needs to be. Any Django user probably has a similar experience to share.<p>Although I welcome discussion about Kubernetes and other orchestration tools, I&#x27;m looking for something a little more lightweight.<p>Looking forward to a good discussion, some of the best threads on HN are those with founders swapping knowledge.<p>Thanks in advance.",
