While supporting any calendar app (not just Google Calendar).<p>How have you solved this in the past (or present)?\nIs there a service&#x2F;project that handles this smoothly?<p>My gut tells me that this problem has been solved many, many times before, and that someone may have written a service for it, but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything.<p>The obvious choice seems to be the open formats: CalDAV, iCalendar etc. But I read nothing but bad things about integration with the likes of Google Calendar.
