      "text": "I&#x27;ve spent a month building an open source application for windows [1] mostly assuming that windows worked as it did the last time I built a desktop app (circa 2003). Obviously, things have changed and we now live in new world of Authenticode signed applications! Exciting!<p>In no particular order:<p>1. This seems extremely hostile to open source. I have to outlay ~90 AUD per year for the cheapest possible code signing? When I&#x27;m not making any money off my product??<p>2. It looks like have some movement towards a service that will do code signing much in the same way Lets Encrypt offers free certificates in the form of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigstore.dev&#x2F; - has anybody used this? any other options available in the near future that might also solve this?<p>3. Finally, I&#x27;m about ready to give up and just eat the cost. Any suggestions on what provider to use? (I&#x27;m based in Australia)<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Rodeoclash&#x2F;vodon-pro",
