      "text": "I started to code at 10yo in 2010(some crappy php&#x2F;sql websites and a tiny bit of C)<p>A few OK projects at 15&#x2F;16yo.(like a free music streaming app)<p>Then I went to college, at 18yo I quit my first internship at a successful startup after a month because I felt like they were taking advantage of me&#x2F;not respecting me.(low salary, lied about part-time remote, founders being a bit condescending, the tasks given to me were also boring...)<p>Then I participated in entrepreneurship programs for 6 months, made one MVP there and a few very basic MVPs in my spare time(zero success)<p>Then I had a few short gigs, mostly as a freelancer(~1 year total)<p>All of this is mentioned in details on my resume and linkedin(from 10yo to today)<p>Now I&#x27;m looking for a job, and in the past few weeks I got offered at least 5 interviews for senior roles.(and more junior&#x2F;intermediate roles than I can count)<p>But I don&#x27;t consider myself a senior at all, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m intermediate, at best. I didn&#x27;t even graduate.<p>I also got rejected for junior roles at companies that I would have really loved to work at(not even ultra selective companies, I didn&#x27;t even get interviews), so I&#x27;m really wondering: am I overselling myself and people think I&#x27;m better than actually am?<p>Depending on who I talk to, I feel like I&#x27;m either underestimated(to lowball me?) or way overestimated.<p>How do I show my worth without looking better than I actually am?<p>I really don&#x27;t want to be under-delivering and disappoint everyone at my next job",
