      "text": "I just fell into ticket scam:\nRight now most events in covid-times need a ticket.<p>For a specific event I found a ticket on Facebook. The seller asked to send the money for the ticket as family and friends. No problem. After transferring the money I discovered the seller is not in the city instead in Africa. So I mark the transaction as an unverified transaction. The case gets closed, saying it&#x27;s nothing wrong with transaction. But seller here is marked by Facebook as a scam. PayPal probably has thousands of those cases a day. What can I do? I can not contact support on the weekends. How many here have been falling for a scam through PayPal recently?",
