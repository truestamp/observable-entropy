      "text": "I&#x27;ve built what we believe to be the most distributed Kubernetes (public) infrastructure, spread over 350 datacenters worldwide. We are not using standard federation, we faced multiple challenges not supported by K8. We looked at this from a different angle than your typical run-of-the-mill k8 deployment since we host multiplayer game servers. Those can’t scale like web apps (stateful connections), and require low latency which prevents steering through many proxies. Our goal was to allow on-demand, in a real-time environment, requests to deploy an application (game servers, or anything really) anywhere on this distributed network. We use this technic to get pods in the best location to lower latency which is critical in multiplayer games. We’ve shown latency reduction by 50% in average for majority of the traffic. We leverage edge computing which is why we called the startup Edgegap. Feel free to ask me anything.<p>I&#x27;m guessing some private infrastructure may have more locations, but they&#x27;re most likely private like food chain or something like that. None of them are public, and they&#x27;re typically built to run only 1 set of applications (aka the apps from the food chain).",
