I made a React compatibility library for a Virtual DOM library (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aidenybai&#x2F;million).<p>The idea is to have much faster rendering (a compiler optimizes virtual DOM beforehand) while ensuring the same developer experience React provides.<p>This is very, VERY early stage, so be prepared for weird bugs &#x2F; plugin incompatibility &#x2F; etc. If you have any suggestions, I&#x27;d be more than happy if you replied in a comment with it!<p>You can spin up the demo here &gt;&gt; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aidenybai&#x2F;million-react-compat",
