      "text": "This may well be a controversial question, but as a developer who hates doing UI work, but would like to be able to build UIs for my projects I often find myself wondering why not build and render everything on the server?<p>Thinking about the internet I assume this is how most stuff worked in the past, and clients had little logic. We now have Vue, React etc and really heavy websites.<p>So I would like to understand is there a level of complexity at which a UI framework is needed? Do people build UIs using for example Python? Why not have a Python lib to build a full UI?",
