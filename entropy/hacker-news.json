If they do store it, how do they generate it across so many different machines?<p>A simple solution would be to create a counter, however I would think that would cause a lot of locking?<p>I would like to use hashids across multiple machines as PK and not UUID, ULID, etc., but I want to actually store the hashid as the PK, but hashids are normally generated from a regular auto incremented ID.<p>So how do they do it?",
