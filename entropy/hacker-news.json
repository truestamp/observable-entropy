Max range only needs to be about ~50 feet, tops. What&#x27;s the name of that kind of technology that I&#x27;d need to look up to learn more about it?<p>EDIT: Bluetooth occurs to me, but I&#x27;m thinking more low-level, fundamental than that, entirely without the need to receive (just broadcast only).",
