Among the participants reporting child abuse, 48% had a tattoo or piercing, while only 35% of people not reporting child abuse had a tattoo or piercing.</i><p>It says that <i>48% were abused</i> — almost half. Impressive, ha?<p>However, if you plot what they say, or recalculate, or rebuild the sentence, you get that:<p><i>only 12% are tattooed and were abused, and ~35% are just tattooed</i>.<p>Just saying.",
