The main argument i keep finding is alike  &quot;heavy smokers are lazy and likely won&#x27;t get successful in their job or life&quot; and stuff like this, which might is true in statistics but not for me.<p>On the opposite i am happy to have a tool that i can use to calm down that isn&#x27;t valium or alcohol, that helps my migrains as well as is able to give me creative kicks i need for my work.<p>I am wondering what your experience is, what changed?",
