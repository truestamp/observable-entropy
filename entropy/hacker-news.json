It works great, but no longer receives security updates.<p>I&#x27;m mostly afraid that some unpatched bug will leave my home network vulnerable; or that I&#x27;ll wake up one day and find that my router turned into a paperweight because of an unpatched vulnerability.<p>Better reception would be nice, but, except for one problem spot, I have great reception throughout my home.<p>Thoughts? Should I replace my router just because it&#x27;s old and unsupported?",
