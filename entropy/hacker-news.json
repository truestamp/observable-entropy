      "text": "We built a site that posts one machine learning question every day.<p>Each question presents a problem. Usually, a real problem that you and I have or will face at some point in our careers. Questions are multi-choice, and we show you a full explanation after you answer them.<p>No bullshit: you load the page, answer the question, and leave. The next day, rinse and repeat.<p>We are using AWS in the backend. The questions are stored in a simple DynamoDB table. The React app fetches the questions from an API and tracks some basic stats, like the accuracy of the answers. Very basic functionality, but after the huge reception, we are already working on a few features like sessions and email subscriptions.<p>We have many ideas around a database of high-quality machine learning questions. We are already planning to extend the site in different ways.",
