Another thing to think about is noise - it&#x27;s louder for you, the consumer, than window units, but in some cases, it&#x27;s good because sometimes your neighbors start complaining about the noise to their landlord if you&#x27;re renting.

So a friend advised me to contact one company https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airconservicing.org&#x2F;type-of-aircon-service&#x2F; and said they could solve my problems. It was my last hope, and yes, they were indeed accommodating.",
