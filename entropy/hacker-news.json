In the last 4 years, I made:<p>•   https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visalist.io, an all-in-one visa requirements website for travelers with 300K Monthly Active users<p>•  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anexplorer.co, an all-one File manager for phones, watches, TV&#x27;s and tablets on android with crossed 1M downloads recently<p>•  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acrypto.io, a cryptocurrency app to track and get real-time alerts with 200K downloads<p>•  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simpleops.io, performance, web vitals and API monitoring tool for websites with 2000 users<p>I started my indie maker journey to become financially independent and travel the world. I had a simple and small goal, build things I wanna use and make $100&#x2F;day. It started slow, I had started building and improving while traveling, it took a while but I crossed $100, then I crossed $200&#x2F;day. Then pandemic hit and I went back to $100&#x2F;day, but after 6 months and building a new microstartup, it slowly picked pace and again crossed $200&#x2F;day then I crossed $300&#x2F;day, now I&#x27;m close to $400&#x2F;day and my next goal is $500&#x2F;day.<p>If the momentum keeps up, I will hit $150K this year.<p>AMA!<p>And if you wanna know the learning that I share, follow my journey on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;1HaKr.",
