I have been interested in more of the mathy parts of CS, algorithms, theory of computation, discrete math, graph theory, game theory, and behavioral economics.  More recently, I&#x27;ve done a lot of applied machine learning at work and have an MS in CS with a focus in ML.  Within or adjacent to these interests, I&#x27;d just like to take some good classes.",
