I am wondering if there is a similar report or just shared experience with USB thumb drives?<p>I am working on a project where we need to buy a bunch of them for a specific application that requires the storage to be reliable (write once, read only in emergency and hopefully lasts)<p>I&#x27;d be interested in hearing if there are any formal reports out there (I haven&#x27;t been able to find any) or just anecdotal experiences. What brands are best, which models, which can handle a drop or two while also offering a faster USB interface and write speeds? etc.",
