      "text": "Hi!<p>What are the hard problems I can expect if I try to build realtime features into our product?<p>Should I even try to build it or look at third party suppliers? I&#x27;ve seen various articles that compare DIY with buying it in, but they&#x27;re from those suppliers and I wonder how neutral they are.<p>It&#x27;s obviously complex, but what are the primary engineering challenges? Message delivery ordering&#x2F;duplication and missing messages? Is it security&#x2F;authentication or problems with debugging and observability? Or should I worry most about infrastructure, scaling and performance?",
