      "text": "Hey everyone. It is Friday and I just had rather unpleasant experience on one of the last social media sites I use ( dropped FB few years ago ). The details are not super relevant, but I dislike being threatened with lawyers over relatively benign comment under parent&#x27;s post. In truth, I think I forgot this is a corporate space.<p>It does not help that LI has become less valuable to me over the past few years ( no referrals, very few real connections and conversations are limited to corporate propaganda ).<p>Anyway, the real question comes now. What do you guys do as a replacement of sorts? I suppose I could set up a personal website ( I have an old page I did not touch in years that is basically empty ), but is that really worth the trouble? It seems that all recent jobs I had are from people that know me to begin with.",
