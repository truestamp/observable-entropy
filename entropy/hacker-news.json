      "text": "https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30664767<p>Seriously.<p>Not sure what the flaw is in the HN algorithm that allows such things.  In this particular thread I went way out of my way to provide mathematical support and detailed analysis for the issue I suggested should be discussed.  And yet, as is often the case with certain subjects, the mob descends and cancels all possibility of a potentially eye-opening discussion.<p>Now, I know just how difficult it is to moderate a public forum.  I did it myself going back to the wild USENET days.  Not faulting you or anyone at HN on this at all.<p>I just want to raise the question because, well, it sometimes seems that a monoculture is the only thing that is acceptable here.  Not to draw a parallel, but the world is seeing just exactly how damaging it can be when people are not allowed to even mention anything that does not align with the approved culture (Putin&#x27;s Russia).  Not a fair comparison?  Why was my post flagged then?<p>I don&#x27;t have the right to be, well, right, on everything I say or think.  Of course I don&#x27;t.  Nobody does.  And yet, nobody should have the right to cancel what I have to say provided it isn&#x27;t an incitement to violence or utterly abusive to others.<p>In this particular example, what I put on the table is a perfectly reasonable engineering&#x2F;scientific discussion that can be quantified.  Math and physics.<p>Instead, what comes back is the equivalent of religious belief and ganging-on of like-minded people to effectively silence and cancel that with which they disagree.  It is, to use the term, deplorable at best and down-right dangerous at the extremes.  It is odd this happens today, when the history of science has so many examples of brilliant minds that were silenced for daring to not fall in line with what was deemed to be &quot;the truth&quot;.<p>Progress isn&#x27;t made this way.",
