The site is pretty scrappy, so any feedback is appreciated!<p>Also, please submit any projects that we don’t already have listed!<p>Thanks,\nJarren",

Everything I&#x27;ve seen so far is just for people trying to make money off of their blog and is all about SEO&#x2F;monetization. I write my blog just for fun, and I feel like it would be nice to get feedback and advice from people in the same boat. None of my friends are really into tech, so I hoped HN might know about some online communities?<p>Thanks,",
