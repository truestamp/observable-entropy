      "text": "If you build it, they will come is a fallacy. I know it. I have built several products that have bombed. My latest flop is an HTML to PDF conversion API called PDFMark.<p>The pundits and coaches say you should always do your market research before writing a single line of code. And I think I have done market research. I had once built a cloud-based photo backup application after surveying existing users of my photo watermarking application. Many of them said they would use a cloud-based photo backup application. I had thousands of photographers using my photo watermarking tool and they were the obvious target users of a photo backup tool. Yet hardly anyone signed up for the product. When I conducted a survey and I asked them if photo backup was a problem and if they would use a cloud backup service they said yes, but when it actually came to signing up for the service and shelling out real money, not many people did.<p>I am lost as to what do I even ask the prospective customers anymore? Henry Ford said if I had asked customers what do they want they would have said a faster horse. I am confused about the whole market research business.<p>New trend on Twitter is about building a community before you build a product. I have followed several community builders. And I quickly realised, people who have thousands of followers are mostly good at gaining more followers. Those who are building real products have no time to post 20 times a day to build a Twitter following.<p>When I look back, I realise that many of the products I have built simply because I thought building them would be cool. My most successful product – the photo watermark software uMark ($4K monthly) is one such product. I had built it because I thought it would be cool to build. I had no use of that product myself, I did not ask anyone if they needed such a product, I did not check if there was anything available in the market already. I did not waste time thinking a name or designing a logo. The first version was built over a weekend and released on a free download site. It got 1500 downloads on the first day.<p>I really don’t know if market research and community building and all that is as important as it is made out to be. After that first product I have had no such luck with any other products.<p>What do you guys think? What kind of market research did you do before launching? How did you decide which product to build?",
