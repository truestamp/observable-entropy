That was well over a month ago, and after a few follow up emails I&#x27;ve gotten no response. Is there anything I can do?",

It has that shiny new WebOS 6 that seemly is plagued with ads even if you disable all permissions, and I heard reports it is circunventing pi-hole too (by putting ads on same server as content you actually want).<p>The Brazillian version of it insists in advertising content available on &quot;Looke&quot;, with little filtering, it has no shame in just pasting there posters of splatter horror movies or adult stuff, for example ads for a documentary about Rocco or another named just &quot;Porn&quot; with a giant naked ass on the poster.<p>Anyone know how I buy a dumb TV? One that does not need internet, at all? Or if it does need internet to update its firmware, it won&#x27;t spy on me or fill stuff with ads?<p>OLED TVs aren&#x27;t cheap either, and I am very disappointed that even paying a ton of money I am still the product.",
