      "text": "Ok so the high level breakdown:\n1. Read and do the problems for the first half of the book. Do not rush this part of the process.\n2. Skip the second half of the book when the chapters switch to being real world examples\n3. Having trouble on a particular section? Watch the youtube video to get a cleaner read: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=22hwcnXIGgk&amp;list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx\n4. Don&#x27;t spend too much time on NP&#x2F;NP-Complete&#x2F;NP-Hard topics\n5. Over learn chapter 2. This is arguably the most important chapter having a deep understanding of runtime analysis helps you in every other chapter and on the interview\n6. Don&#x27;t spend too much time on writing proofs in Chapter 1. Understand them and be able to work through them and understand how the math comes together, but writing a specific proof isn&#x27;t too valuable. \n7. Sometimes the interview problems at the end of the chapter are silly. If it feels dumb, example: 1.36. How much does the ice in a hockey rink weigh? Skip it. These are older school programming interview questions and have been largely phased out<p>Ultimately I feel like this book is the best resource for big tech interview prep, and I want to help my students spend their time as efficiently as possible. If anyone has additional advice or feedback on how I can improve this list, I&#x27;d love to hear it.",
