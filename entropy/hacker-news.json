      "text": "I am trying to construct schema of an api call response, made inside the code, based on the usage of the response object inside the code.<p>Since this is a javascript code base there is no defined schema for the response object. To construct the response schema, i am planning to parse the entire codebase into AST, and traverse the usage (to multiple level) of the response object to find its usage, there by I would be able to reconstruct the actual schema.<p>Can you refer me to any existing tool&#x2F;implementation&#x2F;methodology to achieve this.<p>It will be great how you will approach this problem",
