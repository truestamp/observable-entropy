      "text": "Dear HN,<p>We just launched a small micro-financing fund for startups and businesses that deal with inventory&#x2F;physical stake.<p>The project is known as Comenda which is a classic form of financing that was used in Europe during the Renaissance. We&#x27;re aiming to revive this.<p>There is currently upto Â£200k ($250k approx) available for startups that meet the funding criteria.<p>The great thing about Comenda is that there is no equity stake required by the investor and there are no interest repayments.<p>Comenda is centred purely around using the inventory as security&#x2F;collateral.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in getting a capital injection for your startup, please check out the website and fill in the form<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comendafinance.com&#x2F;",
