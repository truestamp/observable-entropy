      "text": "Sometimes when I&#x27;m exploring code that I need to edit, it would be nice to be able to craft a &#x27;journey&#x27; through different places in the codebase that I could easily jump forward or back through to easily follow along with what&#x27;s going on so I can more easily reason about the changes I&#x27;ll need to make.<p>Like say there&#x27;s a react component in file A that sends an event to an xstate state machine in file B and then that has a number of state transitions that result all in different places in that file, it would be nice to be able to create a sequence of bookmarks so to speak between each of these places and then be able to easily jump forward and backward in that sequence in order to more easily reason about the code.<p>Does anybody know of tools like this?",
