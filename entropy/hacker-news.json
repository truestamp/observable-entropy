Just because a domain is expired, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s available right away. But still, I&#x27;d like to keep my eye on them.<p>- Sometimes, it&#x27;s just super interesting to see when some high profile names are available through obsecure TLDs (e.g. twitter.beauty, twitter.accountant, twitter.dealer domain names are available. What would happen if I buy them and do something with it. Twitter will probably come after me, but hey, it&#x27;s an interesting thought. Maybe they&#x27;ll buy them off? I don&#x27;t know. What other high profile names are available through other TLDs?<p>cheers!",
