Our end goal is either to have our own things that we&#x27;re attached to, or have clients where we can be more involved.<p>So we figured that we will learn more about product lifecycle by releasing whatever we can, and this is our first step: a simple bot that notifies you on Discord whenever something happens on GitHub.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback! Or if you&#x27;ve been on this road before and you have some insight.",
