      "text": "Hello HN, what is your development strategy?<p>I am a relatively experienced hobby developer who recently joined the workforce. In one of my recent projects, which as a small solo project, I noticed that I was not putting in my best effort when it came to the quality of my code and work. I was so focused on the hand-off that I forgot some parts of the main feature, which ended up not working.<p>My question is: how can I prevent this from happening again?<p>Do you use lists or mental models to remember the main objectives? And how do you assess your own work to ensure that you didn&#x27;t miss anything?",
