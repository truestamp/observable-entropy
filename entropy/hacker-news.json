      "text": "I recently had my Facebook account hijacked. My password was compromised and they were able to log in. Facebook sent my email account a message that I logged in from somewhere new, and then an email to &quot;verify this browser&quot;, but the malicious actor was able to log in despite my email account not being compromised. They then changed the password on my account and then the email address. This all happened at 4am local time<p>Each email had a link that said &quot;if you did not do this, click here to secure your account&quot;, but that link requires you log in, which you cannot do if a 3rd party has changed your email or password. Also, contrary to what Facebook says in their help, they did not send my primary email account a message to revert the email change. As such, I was unable to maintain control of my account.<p>How the heck am I supposed to get it back? I eventually got to some process that asks me to submit a government ID for verification, and I was able to do that, but all they did was send me an email that they can&#x27;t give me back the account until they verify my ID and it&#x27;s been radio silent since. There&#x27;s no case number or anything else I can use to follow up or ask for help.<p>What the hell? Facebook, you can&#x27;t have strict rules around how people make and use accounts if you can&#x27;t guarantee them access to their accounts like this. \nIf I never get it back, what am I supposed to do? If I make a second account I will be in violation of Facebook&#x27;s rules.",
