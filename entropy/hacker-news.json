      "text": "I have the impression that only a small fraction of Python jobs are for general programming and backend (my area)... Data science (not my area) seems to be the majority of Python positions.  Am I correct in my analysis? Java+Kotlin, on the other hand, rules the backend.<p>What I love about Python: \n- Programmers culture of simplicity, simple solutions are always preferred (contrast that to Java, below)\n- Fast development and iteration\n- Easy debugging\n- No need to deal with Maven or Gradle<p>What I hate about Python:\n- The language is huge, a lot larger than Java, takes a lot more time and effort to master it. It&#x27;s easy to get started programming in it, but I&#x27;m talking about <i>mastering</i> it, not intermediate-level knowledge of Python. And it keeps growing. It&#x27;s going the way of C++.\n- The GIL and lack of multithreading. There are several workarounds but they are still workarounds.\n- Deployment (pip, venv, etc)<p>What I love about Java:\n- The JVM\n- The performance\n- Easy deployments with JARs\n- Language small enough to master, unlike Python which is huge (although it seems that Kotlin is also huge)<p>What I hate about Java:\n- Cold start time\n- Maven (which is its own beast)\n- Gradle (which is its own beast)\n- XML obsession\n- forced OOP where it doesn&#x27;t fit well\n- Programmers culture of complexity, love for &quot;design patterns&quot;, overengineering, &quot;enterprise&quot; stuff, getters and setters (public fields frowned upon), etc<p>(I know modern Java has gotten better and less enterprise-y but some points above still stand)<p>I have a feeling I&#x27;d be happier writing backends in Python instead of Java (or Kotlin), but the availability of jobs is a huge factor for me.<p>Background: software developer with &gt;10 year experience, haven&#x27;t touched Java since 2012 (so I&#x27;d need a big refresh and relearn it), have worked on simple Python scripts for automation (so I&#x27;d need to dive deeper and learn it more) and most of my work has been with Golang. Plus if I decide to go with Java I feel compelled to also learn Kotlin since it seems the future in the JVM world.",
