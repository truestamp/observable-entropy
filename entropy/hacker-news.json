      "text": "I have various small projects and home automation systems that I want to be able to invoke remotely and receive alerts from, without setting up a web server and UI.<p>I used to use Notify17 for receiving alerts, but since this shut down I&#x27;ve been forced back to email, and am now looking for a solution to cover both receiving alerts and sending basic commands.<p>These are the options I&#x27;ve considered already:<p>* Pushover - Fine for receiving alerts, multiple recipients supported. No options to respond to them.<p>* Telegram - Sending + receiving. Might be a bit heavy for my use case, and would be better not having the bot publicly accessible. Also makes managing notifications (DND etc) more difficult when also receiving human messages.<p>* Gotify - No iOS app.<p>Essentially what I&#x27;m looking for is an app with a chat-like UI which converts messages to a webhook, and allows me to send responses via an API.<p>On a related note, if anyone else is missing Notify17 and thinking about building a replacement I&#x27;d be willing to pay up to $15&#x2F;mo for a tool that ingests webhooks, allows me to reformat the response with a templating language and sends notifications to my phone.",
