I&#x27;ve also taught CS to younger kids and seen students struggle to internalize the mental model of Git. The learning curve is steep for early devs. Is there merit in having a VCS that has a less steep learning curve or are the benefits of knowing a universal VCS too great (even if you end up using a small subset of the features)",
