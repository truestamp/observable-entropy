      "text": "I want to write a minimal browser layout engine. I know it&#x27;s an extremely daunting task, I don&#x27;t intend to converge with HTML5 compatibility. I just find browsers fascinating and would like to learn more about them.<p>I want to have an actual Window appear that can emit text, color, and shapes. I don&#x27;t want to use a graphic UI framework like WPF. I also believe a graphics library like DirectX or OpenGL would be overkill as it&#x27;s adding features I don&#x27;t need, but I really don&#x27;t know. Chrome and Firefox use ANGLE, maybe that&#x27;s a start?<p>TLDR If I wanted to write a layout engine for multiple OS&#x27;s, should this be built on top of a graphics library, a windowing system, both, or something entirely different?",
