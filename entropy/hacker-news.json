      "text": "I&#x27;m working on an unusually useful way to leverage a daily journal. I&#x27;ve built a pretty complex system&#x2F;app, but it uses my personal daily journal, and am at the point where I&#x27;d like to demo it to others.<p>It incorporates some pretty useful features that I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere else. For my personal journal, I tend to have 5-10 entries per day, so it would be best to showcase a decent volume of data, at least hundreds of entries going back a couple years.<p>I&#x27;ve search all the usual places and just haven&#x27;t found something that would work. Ideally it would be from a relatively modern perspective, like within the last 50 years or so, but I guess it could work from older. And for now would prefer something in English and in parsable&#x2F;plain text format.<p>Does this ring a bell for anyone?",
