      "text": "So I&#x27;m someone who created an iOS app that tells you whenever either bitcoin or ethereum moves x% up or down.<p>I made this app because I would check prices too often and knew others would want this app too.<p>There are no in app purchases, or ads. I think this is why Apple really rejected it. They don&#x27;t like the fact that I&#x27;m not trying to charge, just providing a free app for the masses in my spare time.<p>The app requires users to use the &#x27;Sign in with Apple&#x27; sign in method, so that I can associate price move alerts with accounts.<p>They are rejecting my app because it also shows real-time prices of crypto assets. They say I need to move these price checks to be before the sign-in prompt.<p>I can do this, but the whole episode just irked me the wrong way. What&#x27;s their freaking problem? Coinbase makes you sign in before showing you crypto prices, so why am I being singled out? Or do you just reject new apps for no reason because you have to show you&#x27;re doing something?<p>I try to see the best in Apple, I really do. I&#x27;ve shipped 15 iOS apps for them, but they irritate the hell out of me.",
