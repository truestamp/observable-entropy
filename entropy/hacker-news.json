      "text": "I&#x27;m a hobby cartoonist and I wanted to know how to go about building an AI model that could help me make New Yorker style cartoons<p>I do have a decent amount of experience with ML and have worked with an image to text generator before on the flowers and birds dataset.<p>However this is a very different problem compared to that. For some context, new yorker style cartoons have a scene and a line below the scene which acts as a punchline. The actual scene would represent an another description.<p>For example, the image here is basically of a deserted island but the text below the scene talks about searching for someone. \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CeZSmJ6hr8z&#x2F;?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link<p>I believe it would be better if I just focused on the visual description of the image than the scene based description. But I would love some inputs on that<p>Also would it be possible for me to use a larger text to image model and train it on a few images to get this style of output? Any resources on that would be appreciated!",

The search returned dozens of spam messages offering drugs in Asia and the US with information to contact on Wickr for price.<p>I reported these drug spam posts to LinkedIn - which is supposedly an anonymous report.<p>Next day I got a flood of reports on my own comments (nothing to do with that topic), so many I didn&#x27;t bother to appeal as I had other things to do. Few hours later my account was down.<p>Seems that for retaliation the drug network decided to find me out and use their accounts to subvert LinkedIn&#x27;s policy and ensure I can&#x27;t stop their spam. They have new spam up now while my account is gone.<p>No good deed goes unpunished I guess.",
