      "text": "Aside from the trolling and otherwise immature behaviour we see in certain online communities (usually ones with a lot of very young people), I&#x27;ve actually observed that people in real life seem so much more complacent and uncritical compared to people online.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s a sample bias because of the online communities I visit (like HN) and the real world that I live in, but in general, I&#x27;ve observed that people in real life seem overly concerned about keeping things &quot;harmonious&quot;, with all the small-talk, the lack of real listening, talking past each other, not voicing differing perspectives, etc. They also seem to lack patience in various things, whether that&#x27;s discussing or examining something (can&#x27;t think of examples right now), and would rather &quot;go back to their own lives&quot;. In contrast people online seem so much more generous.<p>I&#x27;m guessing this is partially because &quot;being on the internet&quot; naturally filters people. But what else is there? What&#x27;s your experience with people online vs in real life? Why do you think this is the case?",
