This morning was cloudy, and as such there was no shade. Of course the sun was still behind the tree top, just shrouded by cloud.<p>I felt the heat on my skin, and it was obvious I’d get burned before long.<p>I hadn’t considered this before; is it possible that the blanket of cloud is diffracting the sunlight, and makes the clouds themselves a source of UV, as opposed to a singular source (the sun).<p>Would this explain why I’m being burned despite the sun being hidden behind the tree canopy (and clouds)?<p>I never considered that clouds could be negative for seeking shelter from the sun.",
