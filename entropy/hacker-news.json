      "text": "I built this websocket game with the intent of learning the actor model with Actix, and getting better with Rust. The front end is made with Svelte, though I&#x27;m not really a frontend person, so if you poke around it&#x27;s bound to be clunky. I&#x27;ve tested it with with Chrome, Firefox and Android, but not iOS or Safari. If you find errors with those, I&#x27;d appreciate a quick note.<p>I have yet to clean up the frontend, but you can find the backend source [here](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kilroyjones&#x2F;game-server\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kilroyjones&#x2F;game-server</a>), if you&#x27;re curious. This could have been built with socket.io, but who doesn&#x27;t want to spend more than double the time building a higher performance server to push around 100 bytes of JSON?<p>The game is cooperative because I enjoy cooperative play more than competition, and wanted to build something that pushed people to work together. There&#x27;s no in-game communication, so you really need to pay attention to what your teammates are doing.<p>Advice, comments and criticism are welcome.",

      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m Arnav, the creator of Rune. I&#x27;ve been a long-time reader of newsletters.<p>Historically, newsletters have been about sharing a collection of links or short form content. However, with platforms like Substack and Revue becoming the preferred publishing medium for many, newsletter content has become more long-form in nature.<p>As a reader, Gmail, Outlook and other general purpose email clients are less than ideal interfaces for reading this such long form content, let alone remember what I read by annotating, adding notes, etc.<p>After grappling with this problem for a while, I decided to build Rune – a dedicated email client for reading &amp; annotating newsletters.<p>Upon signing up for Rune, you&#x27;ll be assigned a unique email address that you can subscribe to newsletters with or setup autoforwarding to from your email provider of choice.<p>TL;DR: Rune is an alternative email app for reading and annotating newsletter content.<p>Excited for you all to try it :)",
