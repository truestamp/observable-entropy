      "text": "Hello!<p>I am no political person but lately I&#x27;ve wanted a way to better see what changes are being made and who is voting for them. I decided to create and app and then make it into a nonprofit to ensure we are not leaning towards any political party.<p>My nonprofit project is called VoterScore and with it, I hope to reshape some of the political conversations by allowing anyone to voice their opinion on bills with a simple vote. By allowing users to cast their own votes on bills in their state and now nationwide we can provide new metrics in the political space. We can show users who on the ballot best align to their viewpoints. We can show how many voters in a state want a bill to pass or fail. We can show which legislators push bills that the general public disagrees with.<p>Would love to hear some feedback on how to make this better fro everyone! Also if anyone is interested in helping out with the project that would be wonderful too!<p>Take a look! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voterscore.org&#x2F;admin&#x2F;home",
