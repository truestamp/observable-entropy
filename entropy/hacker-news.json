      "text": "Hello everyone\nTLDR: I created a website(DevDrills): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.devdrills.io&#x2F;<p>I recently realized whenever I wanted to practice frontend problems I just googled around, read articles or found questions which weren&#x27;t auto evaluated. This made me think about creating a platform for devs where they can actually solve problems which we devs face in everyday life.<p>My intention with the platform is to help people improve their development skills, help them learn about new concepts through problems and hopefully make a dent in how our industry conducts interviews(shift away from leetcode).<p>The platform is still very young so it only has frontend problems currently and I am working on improving the test cases &amp; adding more questions.<p>Let me know what you guys think this or any feedback you have :). There might be a few bugs here and there but they should be gone soon.",
