To be eligible for one of these roles, you must meet these criteria:<p>1. You must be a regular user of either Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube<p>2. You must have a reliable internet connection<p>3. You must be available 10+ hours per week<p>4. Full training is provided on all of the tasks and you can begin work immediately if you qualify. The companies that you would work for are all around the world, so working times are flexible.<p>Most of these companies just don&#x27;t have time to manage their social media accounts on a day-to-day basis anymore, but also don&#x27;t want to hire another full-time staff member in their office just for this role. So you will be working for 2 or 3 companies at a time, but working remotely from your house.<p>Pre-qualification is done with a simple quiz that takes 5 minutes. You need to fill this out, if we qualify you we are happy to work with you. Please email us here so we can send you the quiz: happylifemakers001@gmail.com<p>Best regards,<p>Gerard",
