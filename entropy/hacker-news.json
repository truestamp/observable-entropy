      "text": "My name is Suket and I built The Moai (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themoai.org). It&#x27;s a platform that enables habit change through social support groups.<p>The idea was born out of my frustration with &quot;productivity porn&quot; on the internet. People would just consume motivational content, but not act on it. This is by design - the attention economy incentivizes consumption over action. The Moai aims to fix this at the root, by providing content creators an aligned business model that makes money only when their audience succeeds.<p>How we achieve this:\n  * Students must place a deposit for accountability. If they don’t complete the program (judged on effort, not results), it is donated to charity (not us). Skin in the game for them and for us.\n  * Students pay what they want. It’s free to join - they only pay if they see results. So far, students average $30 for a 30 day program.\n  * Cohort sizes are small (4 people) to foster real community.\n  * Students must share weekly check-ins on what worked and what didn’t. This creates a tight feedback loop and the foundation for shared learnings, motivation and accountability.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a program built using the platform: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;themoai.org&#x2F;intentional-technology. The goal of the program is to help people use technology more intentionally - less as an escape, more as a tool.<p>I would love your feedback on whether you would consider joining such a program or be interested in building your own program using the platform.<p>Thanks in advance!",
