      "text": "I&#x27;m a ~30y.o. physics researcher and my family is at the moment living on their skin the Ukrainian crisis. \nUp until now they have been able to get (bad) internet access however, after the latest news I fear that Russia will soon disrupt network communications.<p>Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been smart enough to foresee this situation and I didn&#x27;t provide them in time with any satellite phone&#x2F;starlink&#x2F;similar.<p>I&#x27;m in search of any do-it-yourself device capable of connecting to satellite and send SMS or make phone calls. My father has some electronics skills and is fairly good at programming.<p>My hope is that, perhaps, someone could guide me to a good tutorial on how to build a communication device so that I could still hear from them in case the internet will go down.",
