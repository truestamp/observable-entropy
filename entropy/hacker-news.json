If you are suffering from depression, anxiety or are experiencing any sort of mental distress, please seek help.<p>The easiest way to find help is to search for &quot;therapist in {your city}&quot;. If you believe you need medication, you can ask your primary care physician for help and they can refer you to a psychiatrist.<p>If you&#x27;re new to therapy, you should know that one of the most successful approaches to treating depression and anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy. Be sure to ask your prospective therapist if they have received training in that approach.",

      "text": "Hi Hackers,\nI am building a meme discord bot and i was wondering where you guys get good memes from...<p>Is there an api that:\n (1) recommends memes based on user feedback: AI or not. something like a hosted &quot;for-you page&quot; that recommends memes based on likes or dislikes, image or even &quot;mood&quot;.<p>(2.) has reverse image&#x2F;meme search capabilities.<p>(3.) has text or &quot;mood&quot; search capabilities (too).\n (4.) has a wide array of templates, beyond the &quot;trendy&quot; ones.\n (5.) (optional) has a simple way to create memes from text -  it&#x27;s a discord bot, that removes the ability to graphically edit templates.<p>Paid or unpaid, i am interested.<p>Am i asking for too much, maybe? :)<p>Thanks in advance.",
