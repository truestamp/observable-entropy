Other times I am in flow at 100% and feel like if I didn&#x27;t have to sleep or have meetings I could get everything on my plate finished.<p>How do others feel? Are you mostly working at your optimal productivity &#x2F; motivation level? Has it changed as you got older?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me but there are days I get nothing done, and when you have daily stand-ups you simply cannot say that so you just make shit up or say you were swamped in busy work.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if there is a better philosophy to managing people with this in mind, although I am finding that humans need deadlines and external pressure in some form or nothing gets done.",
