      "text": "My startup has created a platform integrated white labeled service. Basically, the users of the platform will see the service offering on the platform, but they will think it’s offered by the platform itself. The COO of a big tech company (market cap &gt;1B) is interested in integrating our product, and has referred us their head of product, but being that it’s a big company, the head of product tells us that should continue this conversation in Q2 of 2022.<p>What can I even do in this situation? I can’t get any value from them in a year or more? We don’t know if we’ll even exist a year from now.<p>Also, how do I make sure this deal doesn’t fall through after a year of waiting?",
