      "text": "The velocity of releases of useful technologies has gone through the roof and I&#x27;m finding it hard to keep up. There&#x27;s enormous churn throughout the &#x27;technical value chain&#x27; with established ways of doing things rapidly being supplanted by sometimes far superior novel methods (wrt one or more of time&#x2F;cost&#x2F;quality).<p>Some things are easier to keep track of because they&#x27;re signaled well, such as GitHub Actions, Copilot, Next.js, and Tailwind.CSS. Other useful solutions can be harder to find, such as Astronomer.io.<p>Any advice on strategies would be appreciated!",
