      "text": "I&#x27;ve always enjoyed chess but when I was in the office today, a colleague had the NFL draft up on the screen and we started talking about economics and budgets for major league teams. What if there was a style of chess where instead of each team starting with equal pieces, each type of piece was assigned a value (e.g. pawn= 2, queen = 50, rook = 10) and each player gets a set number of points (e.g. 100 total) which they could use to spend on any piece they wanted and everyone of course has a king. So someone could end up starting a game with a queen, 4 rooks, and 5 pawns. I know this is a bit of a silly idea but thought it might be a fun twist on an old game and lend a new dimension to how people optimize their strategies.",
