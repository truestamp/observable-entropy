      "text": "After the events of yesterday, I decided to convince my close friends to move to other platforms. I already use Telegram and it&#x27;s been superb to Messenger, WhatsApp, IG messaging, etc. in every way.<p>However, I want to see if it&#x27;s possible to create &quot;micro-messenger&quot; apps; basically, a messenger app that you only use with a handful of people[1]. I want to have full control over the server side, so please don&#x27;t say &quot;just use Signal&quot;.<p>Given Telegram&#x27;s open-source base code, is it possible to create a decent messaging app that goes down when you also go down? (e.g., when you die, or when you just want to terminate it).<p>[1] I think if you&#x27;re going to say something or share photos&#x2F;files that are personal, chances are you are already close to your recipient. And there aren&#x27;t many of those people.",
