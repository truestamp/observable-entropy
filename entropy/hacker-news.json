So I thought, doing a certification would make my profile stronger. Banking on it thought of preparing for a &#x27;Google ML Professional&#x27; certificate.<p>Am I on the right path? I am not sure, as I am doing everything on my own. Please share your advice.<p>Background :<p>I am an experienced senior software developer based out of CANADA wanting to do a career switch to Applied ML.<p>Appreciate your help and support.<p>Thanks!!",
