      "text": "It&#x27;s been a few years since I last looked into virtual DOMs to speed up web app perf. Have browsers solved these problems and there&#x27;s no need for Virtual DOM layers any more? Are there new browser APIs I should be aware of?<p>I now have a new simulation web app, where I&#x27;m often rendering 50,000 agents at once, with 1 agent === 1 dom element. I expect to target WebGL&#x2F;Canvas in the future, but right now my thought was to push DOM to the limit.<p>I&#x27;ve already sped things up multiples through standard profiling using Dev Tools Performance Tab, but while I do that I wanted to start another &quot;thread&quot; going where I look at state of the art ways of faster DOM updates.<p>Is there some blazing fast tiny new virtual DOM only library I should look at?",
