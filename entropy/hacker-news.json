Nothing wrong with this, and not judging; just an observation.<p>So the question is, if we can generate incredibly detailed and believable faces, why not entire bodies with faces?  This must exist already.<p>Who is working on a system to build adult content, made to order, that doesn&#x27;t involve actual humans?  We can already produce very believable landscapes, structures, and moving objects.  How long until the carnal content is algorithmically produced?",
