      "text": "After reading this[0] I can&#x27;t help but wonder how Alice talking to Bob will now be compromised by a third actor: Mallory[1]. From the Wikipedia article on Alice &amp; Bob:<p>&gt; Mallory: A malicious attacker. Associated with Trudy, an intruder. Unlike the passive Eve, Mallory is an active attacker (often used in man-in-the-middle attacks), who can modify messages, substitute messages, or replay old messages. The difficulty of securing a system against Mallory is much greater than against Eve.<p>I had a look at Matrix[2] and it&#x27;s developed in the UK, per their site (&#x27;a non-profit UK Community Interest Company&#x27;) so since the UK is no longer a member of the EU I presume they&#x27;re immune from the EU backdooring Matrix, unless I&#x27;m mistaken?<p>Then there&#x27;s Session[3] &amp; Cwtch[4] which look promising too. I can&#x27;t imagine how Matrix, Session, or Cwtch could be backdoored since they&#x27;re designed differently than other apps.<p>Are these chat systems immune from Mallory? Can we use them going forward when all the mainstream messenger apps are compromised in the near future (Whatsapp, etc)?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutanota.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;eu-surveillance-csam&#x2F;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alice_and_Bob<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getsession.org&#x2F;<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cwtch.im&#x2F;",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m Mario, the creator of Immersive Communities.<p>I’ve been working in my spare time as s solo-developer on this project for the last 4 years and finally completed it last month.<p>Immersive Communities is a social media platform for content creators where they can create and monetize their own communities and collaboratively write articles about their interests. Each community can be monetized with Member Subscriptions and Self-Service Ads. Payments have been implemented with Stripe.<p>A user can register a community from the main page and it will be available on the subdomain of his choice. I chose the PWA-first approach so each community is installable on desktop or mobile and behaves as a full-screen app.<p>Feel free to check it out and let me know if you have any questions.",
