      "text": "As history record shows that a bunch of religions have been survived for thousand years, a lot of church and temple, along with modern technology and government of secular and non-secular states.<p>So, I am adjusting my attitude to live with cryptocurrency stuff because I think it is not going anywhere and could still exist for my lifespan. Cryptocurrency&#x2F;blockchain knowledge like religions, there are good concept applicable and useful in life, there are also tons of bullshit, scam, even violence. I would like to collect sources of knowledge that is not related to any cult non-sense.<p>Knowledge in crypto&#x2F;blockchain stuff I would like to know, for example, what&#x27;s top 5 coins, overall promising regarding transaction rate, fee, market cap, suitable for application (e.g. dapp), technical and philosophical limitation. I have pretty good exploring skills, read a lot of data, but when it comes to knowledge around cult, it takes a lot of energy to filter out greed based statement.<p>Where are secular sources of crypto space knowledge?<p>Thanks.",

I&#x27;ve got some ideas on how I can anchor and fill in binary data into the graphic design but I&#x27;m a bit unsure as to how I should approach the reading&#x2F;decoding part (with a camera).<p>Sorry if this isn&#x27;t the right place to ask this.<p>QR codes have been around for a while. I like the way facebook messanger or snapcodes approach the task of human-friendly and machine readable designs, but I&#x27;d like to experiment with something new.<p>It doesn&#x27;t need to encode too much information anyway.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading into AR with unity. I don&#x27;t mind learning some c# but I&#x27;d ideally want to write a solution in python or javascript.<p>Thanks again",
