But he didn&#x27;t care about the thought process, he just wanted me to code the optimal solution as quickly as possible. When I got stuck for a minute, and I was trying to think it through, he just told me to code it. I don&#x27;t understand why I would want to work with someone like this?<p>Another interview, I went in thinking it would be leetcode questions, but the interviewer proceeded to ask me questions specifically pertaining to the language. He started asking me questions on syntax, how do I filter or group data sets using the language, how would I create threads, etc. Of course, he also wanted this all on Notepad. I was taken aback, as all of my focus was on studying algorithms.<p>On and on. There is no set format, I&#x27;m not told beforehand what I&#x27;d be asked about.<p>I&#x27;ve asked the recruiters what I&#x27;d be asked beforehand, and obviously not so helpful on that end.<p>How does one handle the variety of questions that you could possibly be expected to answer? I&#x27;m at the point where I just want to go do something else with my life.",
