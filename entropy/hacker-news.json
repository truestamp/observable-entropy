      "text": "(I&#x27;ve clearly spent too much time with Feynman and quantum but...)<p>Quantum computing is statistical in nature. Experiments need to be performed multiple times to get reliable results.<p>Which got me to thinking... Quantum effects occur everywhere at room temperature. One example is the thermal noise in a resistor.<p>It ought to be possible to impose forces, such a magnetic fields, on the resistor to &quot;shape&quot; the thermal noise in various ways. Using this shaping effects it ought to be possible to impose some logic &quot;on the noise&quot;. From there, it seems reasonable that statistical measurements could yield &quot;computed results&quot;.<p>The useful point is that it ends up using quantum effects at room temperature, albeit somewhat slower than in a supercooled quantum computer. It seems reasonable that there must be a &quot;speed vs temperature&quot; curve for this &quot;in the noise&quot; computing.<p>One interesting experiment would be to create a Toffoli gate in a resistor using N vs S magnetic fields as the control elements. Since this would be symmetric it would also be reversible.<p>The end result is a &quot;room temperature&quot; quantum computer.",
