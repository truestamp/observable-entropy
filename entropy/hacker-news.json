      "text": "More often than not, after the fact we learn that we weren&#x27;t fully informed.<p>This time, russia is accused of mass-murdering innocent civilians. Not sure if you even heard of what I&#x27;m referring to, I&#x27;m in germany and we&#x27;re being bombarded with messages how evil russia is, and so on.<p>I&#x27;m neither russian, nor a mass-murderer, nor someone even remotely close to liking a mass-murderer. I&#x27;m not russian, for that matter, I don&#x27;t have a relation at all to russians, aside from liking the now destroyed AN-225 engineering marvel.<p>I don&#x27;t use facebook, aside from occasionally noticing mails from remote family branches posting an update there, which I (with a bad conscience) ignored for as long as I can remember.<p>I don&#x27;t like Putin. He&#x27;s the head of a shithole country pampering intellectually challenged folks which happened to be at the right place in time to own lots of natural resources (&quot;oligarchs&quot;).<p>But still, I don&#x27;t buy any of the propaganda regarding the current conflict. It&#x27;s not true to me that Russia is trying to destroy Ukraine. If they wanted to, and if they really don&#x27;t care about nuclear destruction, why didn&#x27;t they drop an A-Bomb over Kyiv yet?<p>We&#x27;re intelligent folks, most of us at least.
