      "text": "Goals:<p>i. I&#x27;d to learn and put in-place a great app architecture for a front-end app similar to server side code structure that we commonly see in service-oriented apps.<p>ii. Once a framework is in-place: It should be very easy to add a new page as most of data read and bind code would be already in place<p>iii. If I can drive the system (pages, header, sub-headers, menu) via a config then it&#x27;s even better, like want to add a new page - just insert a new entry in the config file.<p>iv. Adding a new textbox on a page should not require a db table change, as the fields can be stored as a json text in just one column. I know it could be a pain for high traffic pages, but for low key pages, I think it&#x27;s a great idea.<p>v. Adding a new page, child page, sub-header should not require a lot of code to be rewritten. The system should promote high reusability of existing code.<p>I inherited an app which has just one main page (old school SPA) but a lot of child pages and sub-headers. It has about 10 js files and each file has about few thousand lines of knockoutjs code. Even a small change requires a lot of fiddling through many files - nightmare.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at many open-source ReactJS projects, but none is having a craft of structure that I&#x27;m looking for.<p>Any leads, resources are highly appreciated. Thanks.",
