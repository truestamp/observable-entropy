I&#x27;m hoping as I look to take an extended break, I&#x27;ll be able to spend more time creating some fun projects off the back of the book, cementing what is taught.<p>- &quot;Project Hail Mary&quot; by Andy Weir, I enjoyed martians, and I&#x27;m keen to keep extending my fiction library (after largely focusing on non-fiction for the past few years).<p>- &quot;Exhalation&quot; by Ted Chiang. Last year I read &quot;Stories of your life and others&quot;, and really enjoyed the writing style, I would like to continue to explore more work by Ted.<p>- &quot;Notes on a nervous planet&quot; by Matt Haig. I can relate highly to this authors view on the current world climate, and am enjoying working through his catalogue.",
