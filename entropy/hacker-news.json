      "text": "I had never heard of ToonApp until recently and it&#x27;s pretty phenomenal. The AI that it&#x27;s using to generate cartoons is so artistic and detailed. All of the vtuber and face filter software (snap cam, animaze) I see around looks like pretty basic face tracking without any AI and not very photo realistic. Are there any technical reasons why someone couldn&#x27;t build vtuber software but with ToonApp level of photorealistic AI? Seems like that would be insane!!?? Why can&#x27;t AI just generate something near the level of CodeMiko?",
