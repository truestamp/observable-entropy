      "text": "I consider HN to be pretty much my &quot;home&quot; on the internet. In spite of all its flaws, I find interesting news here and generally thoughtful and intelligent discussions.<p>Now, after becoming a father I have felt a stronger desire to move towards doing something for the climate. I am not making that transition now, but I have started a &quot;background thread&quot; that researches potential fields that I can explore.<p>One such field that I find interesting is refrigeration tech. There is a subreddit for this, but it&#x27;s not very active and I am wondering if there are other communities where I can start to just listen in on discussions to start getting familiar with the area. Does anyone have a suggestion as to where to go?",
