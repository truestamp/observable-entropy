Or...is it just me that&#x27;d be interested in this?",

This year I will try to use more of my time to try to learn stuff that interest me or can be useful. I probably will fail miserably, but at least its a plan :) And now I have said it, on the internet, so best I stick to it :)<p>Once again\nHappy New Year",
