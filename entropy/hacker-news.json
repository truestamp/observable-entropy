      "text": "Hi,  I am a very happy Java programmer who likes writing internal DSLs.  (Mainly generic methods where you don&#x27;t have to fight with type erasure.)<p>I feel like I understand how generics work in Java pretty well but every so often I am scratching my head about &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t it solve for the right type here?&quot;<p>Asking on forums I find a lot of people give up,  there are some others at the same level or who know a little more but it&#x27;s not a complete understanding.  Looking online there is a lot of thing content.<p>Is there a really good book and&#x2F;or a set of problem sets for this one?",
