We saw that current materials and pedagogy tend to be dull and irrelevant. We focus on inspiring kids with interesting content, getting them to draw, and creating their own stories.<p>We now have our own books [1], published books written and drawn by young children, an art exhibition for kids [2], and now a musical!<p>We have kids from around the world performing including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Ukraine.
