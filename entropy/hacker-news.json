      "text": "We all read the same news. The world now is remote. The big companies (not just FAANG) all do algo interviews. There is a shit ton of money in tech. You heard it all. Everybody makes 200k or more.<p>I currently make 130k USD living in Europe. I can maybe get 10k if I switch jobs or, being lucky, 30k more if I try contracting.<p>But no way I&#x27;m going to make 200k+, so there is only one option, US companies. Which mostly look for remote workers in the US. Yeah, I know there are folks from Europe working for US companies, but how many?<p>Outside of the big cities in the US, the average dev salary seems to be around 120kish for a senior position, from what I&#x27;ve read. It seems like they are in a way better position than I am to play the algo game?<p>So I do really not know if I should go down that road or not? I would need to spend serious time learning algos. I never had to. I could pick jobs because there is so much demand.<p>I&#x27;m 35 and working as a dev full time since I&#x27;m 20. I just don&#x27;t know if I should invest that time in learning the algo game or just work a sideproject.<p>What is your take?",
