In an attempt to raise the issue, I uploaded images with text explaining as much and requesting them to reopen the account without ID documents. (FWIW this would be the first time I supply any such documents to FB).<p>They just replied saying: <i>&quot;We can’t give you access to this account or help with your request until we receive an accepted form of ID that matches the information listed on the account.
