      "text": "If we can make plant-based meat which is healthy for carnivores, should we give it to them? I was watching a video showing a komodo dragon eating a deer alive from back to front.

We do a lot to reduce human suffering, but don&#x27;t animals also deserve a life without suffering.<p>Cons : No right to interfere with nature; knowing people, we will probably screw it up completely.<p>Thoughts?",
