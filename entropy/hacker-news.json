      "text": "I graduate high school this year, and I&#x27;d like to keep in touch with my classmates. Since just 15 of us spent almost every class together because of the program we took, we&#x27;re very tight-knit and I&#x27;d like to think we want to keep in touch with each other in the next few years, even if we don&#x27;t communicate regularly.<p>There is a convenient 5-letter .com domain that aptly describes the program at our school specifically, so it would cost maybe $100 to register it for the next 10 years and toss a comment section and photo album onto it. I don&#x27;t want to have to teach everyone how to make an account, etc on another service (plus I can&#x27;t guarantee everyone will remember their password, or that it will still be running) so a comment section might be ideal.<p>If I don&#x27;t act quickly, someone&#x27;s gonna make a Facebook group..<p>Can you think of a better way to allow a group of people to stay in contact with each other, planning for the long-term future?<p>Other things I&#x27;ve considered: Social media group (not long term), email thread (push notification style might stop people from updating it), group chat (ditto).",

      "text": "For my work, I often have to present scientific topics to an audience. This often includes a fair amount of notation in form of LaTeX math that has to go into the presentation slides.<p>So far, I have not found a good solution to efficiently include LaTeX in any presentation software.<p>There are plugins, but they rely on a local LaTeX distribution which, let&#x27;s be honest, is always a pain to manage.<p>These days, I find myself using a browser app to render equations, then download and import the math as SVG or PNG. This somewhat works: The problem is that I have yet to find a web app that supports bot, a wide range of commands (like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;katex.org&#x2F;) or\nthe export to SVG (like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;viereck.ch&#x2F;latex-to-svg&#x2F;).<p>Any suggestions how to optimize my workflow?",
