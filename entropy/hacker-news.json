      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for a solution to help me do calendar management in my system (something like Calendar as a Service).<p>Some of the features that I would need are\n1. Ability to create a calendar for every user in my system.\n2. Allow everyone to set their availability and Off Days. They should also be able to change the availability for a specific day.\n3. Ability for the system to book a timeslot on any of the user&#x27;s calendars.\n4. Ability to check conflicts before booking a slot.\n5. Ability to get notified via Webhooks whenever someone cancels the already booked slots.<p>I don&#x27;t need a UI. I can use any readily available Calendar UI Component. All I need is a service that can provide APIs to manage multiple calendars (one of each user in my system).<p>I&#x27;ve explored Calendly, but it requires every user within my system to have an account on Calendly as well. So it&#x27;s not going to work for me.<p>Currently, I&#x27;m exploring Calendso, but I would appreciate it if you could share any other services you are familiar with that I should explore for this use case.",
