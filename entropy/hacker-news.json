      "text": "HN has been my morning coffee favourite read for years now but it&#x27;s my very first post. I&#x27;m an old man, so please bare with me.<p>I am a seasoned systems architect and developer, now retired. While I was tempted in the first few weeks of my retirement to just turn the page and let it go, I remembered how much I used to enjoy writing small utilities for my own daily workflows. A year ago, I asked my fellow forum members (a Mac-dedicated one) if they would like to beta test some of my applications (and oh, they did). I got high quality feedback I would not have gotten elsewhere. I kept striving to answer their feature requests and today many of my first beta testers are insisting that my applications have outgrown the private beta.<p>I was caught completely off guard by FinderFix (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synappser.github.io&#x2F;apps&#x2F;finderfix&#x2F;), the first application I&#x27;m opening to public beta, making the top row on Reddit a couple of weeks ago. This sudden limelight is both an opportunity and a challenge.<p>I am not complaining. Any publicity is good publicity and I got this kind of genuine enthusiastic feedback: &quot;OH MY GOD! Bro you’re a god sent. Thanks man I love this app. Also that Cmd + X for cut&#x2F;paste. Oof so good!&quot;.<p>I however cherish anonymity and I laud the Internet for allowing me to enforce it. I am thus publishing my software under a pseudonym (a pen name, if you prefer) with a free Apple Developer Certificate. How long will I be able, with Apple&#x27;s current Gatekeeper policy, to preserve my anonymity if I were to turn this hobby into a real business, albeit a small one?<p>For more context, please refer to a couple posts of mine (a manifesto of my core ethos):<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;synappser.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;<p>I guess this is a tough question to answer, unless you&#x27;re an Apple insider, but I&#x27;d really appreciate any guidance you could give me.<p>Thank you",
