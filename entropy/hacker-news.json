      "text": "Is there such a thing as a social media for developers? A little about me, I&#x27;m from Madagascar. After learning English, I am now learning how to program, with the help of various free online courses from top US&#x2F;EU universities, and a specialization in web development. I&#x27;d like to get in touch with developers, from US or EU as I&#x27;d like to get a remote job there and maybe in the long run move out. Most devs here work for so called &quot;freelance companies&quot; that takes care of teaching and finding contract for them, but in the end keeps all the money, while the devs gets just a little above minimum wages (around $300) to keep them happy. If you didn&#x27;t know already, my country is really really really poor (yes that poor). If someone is looking for a mentee also, I would love to have someone more experienced guide me through this journey. Kind of a long shot, I know, but lady luck favors the one who tries. If you have any questions, we can have a chat.",
