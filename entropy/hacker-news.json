      "text": "I&#x27;m an undergrad who did an internship in the query compiler team of a DB company, let&#x27;s call it company A.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve received an internship offer from another DB company B, and I&#x27;m in the process of interviewing with DB company C.<p>Companies B and C are asking me which part of the DB I want to work on for team matching.<p>My question is, what part of the DB should I focus on for these internships, and after I graduate? I&#x27;m mostly split between staying in a compiler&#x2F;optimizer area vs exploring the execution side of the DB, and other areas.\nIt might be good to explore different areas while I&#x27;m an intern (pick execution this time) or start focusing on one area (pick compiler again).<p>My goal is to find an area of DB work that has room to grow (in terms of R&amp;D) and can set me up for a strong SWE career (i.e. the role will have good demand in future markets).<p>What suggestions would you have for me?",
