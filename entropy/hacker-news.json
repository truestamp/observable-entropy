      "text": "Love everyone&#x27;s opinion here on if the serverless functions (Like lambda functions from AWS, GCP cloud functions) have reached a position to create scalable apis to handle User apps with Millions of DAU?\nAlso if you can share your views along:\n1. Databases support available to Lambda (Due to connection exhaust issue.)\n2. Learning curve for new database technologies like dynamo db\n3. Some of these db technologies are vendor lock in. only available from AWS, like Dynamodb, Rds proxy\n4. Do you consider a cold start an issue big enough to not move into Serverless?\n5. Your choice between traditional microservices using docker and ECS&#x2F; Cloud Run or Kubernetes VS Lambda functions to create user facing apis?\n6. Cost comparision of both technologies on scale?",
