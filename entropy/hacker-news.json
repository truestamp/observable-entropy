      "text": "Mild hearing loss in one ear will require me to wear a hearing aid (BTE or RITE) on one side. I enjoy listening to podcasts and music but also need to be on a fair number of calls for work throughout the week. I don&#x27;t have high requirements regarding sound quality as long as the music sounds good enough, I do like a bit of base if possible.<p>Until now I used in-ear headphones for music and an on-ear headset for work. Upon a bit of searching the web, I couldn&#x27;t find an obvious alternative that works well with a hearing aid, over-ear and on-ear seem to cause feedback and in-ear simply won&#x27;t be possible anymore. At least that&#x27;s what I found.<p>Does anyone have experience with this and can recommend a setup? Thank you.",
