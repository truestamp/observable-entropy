It just somehow didn&#x27;t occur to me at the time.<p>This trivial example is basically what my whole life looks like. I keep plowing around,\nback and forth whenever I decide to do ANYTHING. Just chaos.<p>I&#x27;ve tried thinking ahead, whenever I do, I can only think of a monkey smashing two cymbals together.\nEverything I do, I do inefficiently because of it and things only makes sense in hindsight.<p>A software developer without foresight, what a dumb combination :(<p>Is there any hope for me? ANYTHING at all? Any mental exercises?\nOr is it purely genetics?",
