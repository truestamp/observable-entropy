      "text": "TLDR: I use Todoist, Clockify, Gitlab issues, Google Calendar to plan and track my work, but also have to use notion and slack in relation to tasks. I also used Trello extensively in the past.<p>My problem is that none of the tools I use covers all variants of things I need.<p>1-Clockify is good to track where my time goes (and is used by my employer to roughly track how much resource is used per project and kind of activity. It has no planning ability. So I should plan somewhere else and then use Clockify to track the time.\n2-We use Gitlab issues for tasks that relate to product features, bugs, ..., but it&#x27;s not usable for meetings and such activities.\n3-Todoist is a good personal Todo list. It&#x27;s good for things that either should be done on a specific time, or should be done in priority. Not good for things that should be done periodically, especially if you have many of those.\n4-For meetings, using a common calendar is a must. To be able to find free time, etc.\n5-Trello is great for a simple Kanban experience and for its core features, but for things like time tracking it rapidly becomes difficult to use.<p>So I end up having to check Todoist, Calendar, Gitlab issues regularly to decide what to do next. I also need to use Clockify to track the time of the task I chose from those products. If something from Todoist escalates to become a team task that should not go into Gitlab, I have to delegate it, and keep the task open in Todoist to remember the follow-up.<p>I think that experience is not optimal: I like to have one tool (that ideally integrates well with Calendar, Clockify, etc), but check one single place to decide what to do next, and track my time from there, and if I delegate, it should go in a separate list, and ideally I should get an even better experience if some of my team also use the same product.<p>I&#x27;m even ready to start a project if none exists, but I hope I can find something, as I know it would be a non-trivial effort.<p>1-How do you plan your team&#x27;s tasks and your work related tasks ans personal tasks?\n2-Are you aware of such an all-in-one product?\n3-If not, do you think there is a reasonable demand for such a service?",
