I&#x27;m mostly interested in the VC funds that invest in Saas and technology companies from seed to series A.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about this strategy for my video production service, and I&#x27;d love to hear if any of you have any experience with these types of partnerships and if it&#x27;s something worth pursuing.<p>Btw, my name is Heleana, and I run a video production service called www.videodeck.co.<p>We produce product demos, and explainer videos, and we help companies repurpose their written content by turning it into videos.<p>I&#x27;d love to connect with you on LinkedIn so feel free to reach out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;heleana-tiburca&#x2F;",
