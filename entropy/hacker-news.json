      "text": "Say, I have three entity types `Senior`, `Junior_A` and `Junior_B`. Each entity specifies access control for other entities. So I can either create tables as follows:<p><pre><code>   Senior, Junior_A, Junior_B, AccessControl\n</code></pre>\nwhere AccessControl holds access control details between all the entities. This simplifies the code but could lead to performance issues as everything is put into one table.<p>But, then I can also create the tables as follows:<p><pre><code>    Senior, Junior_A, Junior_B, AC_Senior_Senior, AC_Senior_Junior_A, AC_Senior_Junior_B, AC_Junior_A_Junior_A, AC_Junior_A_Junior_B, AC_Junior_B_Junior_B\n\n where `AC_ABC_XYZ` is a table that holds access control information between entities `ABC` and `XYZ`. This complicates the code as the code now has to handle different tables depending on the entity types involved, but will improve performance.\n</code></pre>\nWhich design would you prefer, and why?",

      "text": "Normally I rarely write my own opinion on things but this just has to come out now. The other day I participated in a Cloud Meetup in my area, since ages again in even in-person. How could it be otherwise, many of the participants have a DevOps background. But the variations in job titles really amazed me.<p>I feel like the term DevOps is becoming inflationary. Sometimes I feel like many people forget what DevOps is all about. It is not a job title that you print on a business card, it is not a department within a company that you can create and then you have automatically established DevOps principles, no DevOps is a culture that must be lived.<p>In the two hours of the Meetup I got to know more of the xOps variations than I would have liked, including FinOps, GreenOps, SecOps and many more.  Is this a trend to combine various areas with DevOps and invent new words?  Where will this lead us, will every area that has contact points between development and operations now be given a new name? ComplianceOps, PeopleOps? I don&#x27;t think they are doing themselves any favors.",
