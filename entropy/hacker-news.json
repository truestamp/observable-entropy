      "text": "I ask because I went through this process many times in my previous business, and the process was just incredibly complex and time-consuming. Our process went something like this:<p>1. Finding suitable users\n2. Scheduling back and forth\n3. Preparing for interview\n4. Conducting interview\n5.

Or has anyone else had a similar experience?",
