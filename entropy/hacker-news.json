      "text": "Hi hacker news, so I&#x27;m working on a project where I&#x27;d like to basically run an application 24&#x2F;7. 24&#x2F;7. But this is a graphically intensive application so I will need to have a GPU for whatever server I&#x27;ve run this on.<p>Amazon is an option I&#x27;m very familiar with, however it&#x27;s very expensive. An EC2 server with a GPU is something like $50 a month.<p>Ideally, I&#x27;d like to get this down to $10 a month. I don&#x27;t really plan to make money here, but I think this would be an awesome project.",
