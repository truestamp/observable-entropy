I think the effects of big distribution model changes (e.g. VHS &amp; DVDs at rental places, then redbox, then just streaming) have shifted the business model of the industry, but have there been other more niche things that shape what gets produced? For instance, are there fewer movies that feature plane crashes because they won&#x27;t get picked up by airlines to be shown on their planes?",
