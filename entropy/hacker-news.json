      "text": "Hi<p>Two weeks ago we launched our swiss MS 365 alternative which was in development for about one year. We now focus on advertisement and are currently wondering how to approach companies.<p>Maybe somebody of the community has a great idea how to do it. Also do you think a there is a big market for our product? We are currently not sure if we maybe have used too much time for development and not enough for testing the market &#x2F; market analysis.<p>The cloud based tool has a quite simple GUI and is capable of\n- File storage &amp; editing\n- Team communication (connected to the storage)\n- E-Mail (connected to the storage)\n- Project Management (Trello like)\n- Time Tracking\n- Password management<p>At the moment there is no App (but if we see that the product has success we will build a Progressive Web App (PWA).<p>Thanks for your feedback. I wish everyone a nice week!",
