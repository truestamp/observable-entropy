      "text": "Hi Hackers,\nI am building a meme discord bot and i was wondering where you guys get good memes from...<p>Is there an api that:\n - recommends memes based on user feedback: AI or not. something like a hosted &quot;for-you page&quot; that recommends memes based on likes or dislikes, image or even &quot;mood&quot;.\n - has reverse image&#x2F;meme search capabilities\n - has text or &quot;mood&quot; search capabilities (too).\n - has a wide array of templates, beyond the &quot;trendy&quot; ones.\n - (optional) has a simple way to create memes from text -  it&#x27;s a discord bot, that removes the ability to graphically edit templates.<p>Paid or unpaid, i am interested.<p>Am i asking for too much, maybe? :)<p>Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "I recently added a Segments feature to the Hangtime mountain biking app for Android and IOS.  If you are familiar with Strava’s segments, this new feature works much the same.  For example, you can add a segment to an existing recorded ride by simply defining a start and end point for the segment. Once the segment is created, it will match any new rides, and optionally “back match” all previous rides. If a segment matches a ride, you you will see your time to complete that segment as well as your personal record (PR) and king of the mountain (KOM) for that segment. The KOM represents the best segment time amongst all riders that have matched that segment. You can also open the segment to see your complete history on that segment to gauge how your performance has changed over time.  Some screenshots and videos as well as other features at the link below.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtbx.bike?page=hangtime\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtbx.bike?page=hangtime</a>",
