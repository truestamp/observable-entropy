Maybe you can plug in your laptop to your body, or have a chip inside your body to mine Bitcoin or whatever. After some research, I assume the generated energy would not be that much but the goal here is to find a way to burn [use&#x2F;waste] the extra energy so that you can lose weight.<p>Any input on this would be appreciated.",
