People are no longer achieving goals aligned with their values — and, since this technology allows no time for introspection — may even not know their values.<p>This was certainly true for me.<p>So I’d love to hear what acts of resistance (or productivity hacks) you’ve engaged in to help yourself avoid these apps.",
