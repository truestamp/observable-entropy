      "text": "The vast majority of us get our news and updates from YouTube these days according to Alexa. YouTube rewards the most recent content in your subject matter by ranking it at the top. For lack of effort and speed of publication, content creators are incentivized to produce content that contains no more than a paragraph&#x27;s worth of substance along with canned slideshows or videos from Shutter Stock or at best, media stolen or copied from previous stories loosely relating to the subject at hand.<p>The slideshows and videos simply have to remotely match what the speaker is saying in often machine-read text or strong foreign accent. We desperately accept this in a mostly vegetative state using the shpeal-stream to distract us from our unremarkable work.<p>The state of our media consumption is at all all-time low, designed to perpetuate our procrastination trance for more views and longer viewing times. What may help our lethargy is a youtube that summarizes our interests into a 5 minute blurb that also happens to auto-update and let us know if we&#x27;re already caught up.<p>Currently, there is no motivation for this format as it doesn&#x27;t match the YouTube reward algorithm for content creators.<p>But if this was the case, perhaps, then, we can get on with our meaningless lives, completing todos faster and show more points on the board for our JIRA Overlords, thus increasing our chances of raises and higher rates of PTO accrual, ultimately getting more afk.",
