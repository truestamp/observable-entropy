Maybe everything was converted to bezier curves or something. The result could be saved as a svg?<p>At that moment I did not see a use case. But now I think it is useful for drawing logo&#x27;s by hand.<p>I think I saw it on HN, maybe even as a Show HN, but I am not sure and cannot find it. Maybe someone else knows?",
