      "text": "Hey HN. I am looking for experiences on how the Data Team is organised within your organisation. There are couple of insights from DBT[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getdbt.com&#x2F;data-teams&#x2F;data-org-structure-examples&#x2F;] and GitLab[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;business-technology&#x2F;data-team&#x2F;]. There are many different functions like infra, application engineers, pipelines, analytics engineers, analysts, DWH engineers, data modellers and so on ... . How do they work together? How ownership model is defined especially in modern SaaS world with GC, Azure and AWS providing more and more out of the box &quot;manage-free&quot; solutions. How do you manage enterprise applications and their integrations into tools? Do you have team per domain, team per tool and&#x2F;or team per function?",
