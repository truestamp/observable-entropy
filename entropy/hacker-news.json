      "text": "We’re trying to bring new ideas to the optimization space. We’ve used a bunch of technologies over time (CP, MIP, LP, heuristics, etc.). We’ve built our own solver (for www.nextmv.io) and learned a lot along the way.<p>Solvers are amazing. MIP solvers, for example, are some of the fastest and most mature software packages that exist. They’re also wickedly challenging to use effectively.<p>Do you use optimization solvers? Which ones? Why? Do you like them? Why or why not?",
