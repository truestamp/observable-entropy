      "text": "As has become increasingly obvious to some parts of the greater Anglosphere&#x2F;UK-diaspora: many universities that were considered bastions of &quot;free speach&quot; have become hotbeds for a form of radical activism against anyone who understands that &quot;transphobia&quot; and &quot;groomerism&quot; and &quot;gaybashing&quot; all come from a common root.<p>Everyone I have worked with directly or indirectly in Games design, development, or engineering seems convinced that there are no Universities left internationally that would sponsor visas for students outside of the EU or Japan that believe that homophobia is unacceptable in any form.<p>Given that I have a long track record as a &quot;radical&quot; when it comes to rejecting papers and submissions for awards that promote racism, hatred, and violence against &quot;outsiders&quot; including Muslims, Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and Jains: I&#x27;m obviously asking this for some friends.
