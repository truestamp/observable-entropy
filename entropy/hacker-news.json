      "text": "My primary browser is Chrome. And it works great for me except when it comes to Google Meet. If more that one person is in the call it is totally unusable if I use external USB camera. I&#x27;ve tried using it with two difference cameras (both from Logitech), and result is the same. If I switch to built in camera on laptop - everything si great. If I open Google Meet in Firefox - external USB cameras work great.<p>Is there some plugin for Chrome that would tell &quot;If the domain is meet.google.com start Firefox and go to that URL&quot;?",
