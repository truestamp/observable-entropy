      "text": "After working at several software companies I’ve noticed most have no way to measure developer productivity. Yet they have a way to measure sales (bookings), marketing (mqls&#x2F;trials), customer success (churn&#x2F;upsell), and product (nps&#x2F;product analytics).<p>As an experiment we’ve starred building an app that measures things like PRs and commits for each developer. I’m not sure this is the best way to solve this problem. I’m curious how engineering managers philosophically think about measuring the performance of their team and if engineering managers are using any quantitative measures how do they do it? How do high performing software teams measure performance?",
