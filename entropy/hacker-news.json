      "text": "I&#x27;d like to work in the US, for that I need an H-1B visa. It seems tough to get one [1] and slightly easier if one did a master program there.<p>Does anyone know of a cheap university offering 1 year (online) master programs that guarantees being selected for the extra 20K H-1B visa lottery?<p>I&#x27;d probably be interested in AI or data science since I&#x27;ve always been interested in the application of machine learning. I wouldn&#x27;t want to choose a degree that I have already done (e.g. master CS&#x2F;master game-design) since in order for this to be worthwhile it (1) needs to be interesting and (2) give me better access to US employers and (3) need to be affordable enough.<p>[1] I applied over 100 US companies, only one responded back and gave me an onsite (pre-covid so I flew to SF). Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t selected due to lack of experience back then.",
