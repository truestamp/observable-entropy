I myself have been using Google to sign into many of the new services these days. So I went about implementing Google Identity SDK. Easy to setup. but when it comes to validating the Google ID token on the server side, it requires Google Client SDK.<p>The php SDK I am using has 14800 files totaling 37 MB!<p>I just want to validate a user.<p>I tried removing unnecessary services from composer.json. Still 14000+ files.<p>I just want to validate a user.<p>This just reinforces my general dislike of frameworks. Just so much of unnecessary fluff that your project if never going to use.<p>I just want to validate a user. It shouldn&#x27;t require including 14000 files in my project.",
