However, multiplayer mode is not mentioned.<p>When I started the thread about multiplayer mode not working, and later suggested an alternate product, my response never gets approved to be posted. This has happened twice. And there&#x27;s still no response from Parallels on actually fixing multiplayer. Or making a note that MP does not work on their blog.<p>Instead, they just don&#x27;t approve comments that link to other software vendors. Or, I guess the &quot;I let my Parallels subscription lapse&quot; was too tongue in cheek. This is dirty behavior either way.",
