Some reasons that come to mind are a) most people don&#x27;t know how to create and share a public key and b) there isn&#x27;t very good integration between public keys and browsers, which are obviously necessary to use services that have complex GUIs. But given the benefit of not having to rely on a third party identity provider like Google, why aren&#x27;t there more people focused on solving those problems?",
