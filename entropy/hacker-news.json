      "text": "I have talked to several people who struggle to figure out which tax deadlines apply to them and their entities, particularly when they have multiple entities. It takes away from peace of mind and makes them worried they&#x27;ll get fined.<p>Is there a good solution to this, other than talking to multiple accountants?\nI&#x27;ve been thinking about creating a solution that uses CPA-validated tax deadlines and software to help business-owners track deadlines, and customize it to use a users&#x27; specific entity types. I would consult with multiple CPAs to make sense of the conflicting info for different entities, then create a software program that sends reminders based on a user&#x27;s specific type.<p>Do you think this would be useful? Does something like this exist?",
