      "text": "yeah, and naturally Linux. I think it is 13 years now. We all have a secret, &quot;Any idiot can make things more complicate,  it takes a genius to simplify.&quot;  Unfortunately,  we do have to become geniuses to use computers and open-source. Git will indeed suck up way-to-much of our time. the process of simplifying it requires a &quot;genius&quot; to cut the learning curve for most common use cases. i see some comments here from proto-geniuses. anyway,  open-source is always waiting for us to do something great merely simplifying the interface to a program in relation to most-common-use-cases. as far as the commandline and its associated programs ...:  hint, it is designed for you to craft aliases and functions that serve your needs.  that is the first thing i would teach.  I think Steve Jobs remarked, &quot;The best interface designers are multi-discipline synthesizers,  not coders.  hard-core coders have their own worlds and not many have a larger view of things.  say the same for 95% of specialists in our society.",
