The company primarily focuses on fulfilling the need for an adequate and fully-fledged enterprise-level software solution.<p>In 2017, Vinod Shukla (founder and CEO), along with Vinit Pandey (CTO) started working on an idea, proposing a solution for an essential need of a viable human resource management system.<p>In 2019, the product was introduced as a beta version in some of the startups. And after a few positive responses, in 2021, the product was successfully launched into the mainstream market.<p>The company grew rapidly even in the COVID-19 pandemic. Being a human resource expert for more than 12 years and understanding the market demand, Vinod inspected each aspect of problems that are being faced by companies nowadays, and hence trying to solve the exact same problem which has been sticking around for ages.<p>EasyFace, a Zeus&#x27; product, claims to cost-cut up to 50% of the management cost for the companies by providing the cheapest face attendance system out there.",
