      "text": "There is more talk than usual about bitcoin as an alternative to cash (vs as an investment) for transactions that are not government mediated. So, if I wanted to use bitcoin (or any major crypto), is it actually possible? Can I pay &lt; .1% fees like I would with fiat and can I buy physical goods anonymously? Or is it really just that I can send money to someone else? I&#x27;ve tried some googling but certainly not found anything definitive. If I don&#x27;t want to &quot;invest&quot;, why would I get BTC instead of cash for personal spending? Or is that not what it&#x27;s for?",
