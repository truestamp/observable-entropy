      "text": "Hello HN,<p>Over the last 15 months, two friends and I developed the music recording app we felt we wanted based on our own needs as musicians. It&#x27;s called Tape It [1] and has just recently hit the Apple App Store [2].<p>We put a lot of effort into a good UX to help musicians really focus on playing their instrument instead of pretending to be a recording engineer. The app records in stereo on newer iPhones (although that&#x27;s a premium feature; the free version only records in standard mono audio quality).<p>I would be really grateful for advice from this community on how to best approach marketing. We had a great TechCrunch article covering our launch [3], and we posted it on various music websites. Turns out advertising on Google or Apple Search is a dark art, though. We have some good ideas for developing a good social media presence, but they will take time.<p>Please hit us with feedback, opinions and advice that you think a young indie company like us can use at this point :). And of course, please go and try the app!<p>Best,<p>Thomas<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tape.it<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get.tape.it<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tcrn.ch&#x2F;3nbODHD",
