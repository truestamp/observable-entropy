      "text": "Over the past, say, 5 years I’ve seen so many headlines about honeybee populations in decline around the world, along with gloomy forecasts of what that means for ecosystems etc. Then I read an article in the most recent Economist that mentions, in passing, that that’s a myth. Which of these is true? And maybe more importantly, if honeybee populations are not in decline, what accounts for the persistence of the myth?",

      "text": "Hi all,<p>I&#x27;ve been hiking in areas with many trail splits and low&#x2F;missing signage recently and my phone &amp; ham radio GPS has been handy. However the app I&#x27;m using doesn&#x27;t seem to have a path-retracing feature, which would be really nice since lots of trails lead back, but only some are not &quot;dramatic&quot; trails.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a FOSS Android app solution if possible. Any recommendations appreciated.",
