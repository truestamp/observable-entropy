The page appears to reload and I&#x27;m left at the top of the page. The only way to hold my scroll position is to open the link in a new tab with a long press.<p>This doesn&#x27;t happen on any other mobile site for me. Also doesn&#x27;t happen when using Chrome on MacOS in mobile emulation mode.<p>Have tried closing all tabs, logging out of HN, quitting browser, deleting HN Safari cache, rebooting phone, all to no avail.<p>$20 Venmo or PayPal to first commenter with a solution. :)",
