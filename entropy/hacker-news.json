      "text": "I have to use Discord and Element on a regular basis (which both use Electron). They both use an unreasonable amount of RAM, and I feel this even more as my laptop is quite old and has 4GB of RAM.<p>I keep looking for alternatives to Electron, which wouldn&#x27;t require such heavy resources to run, but my searches always seem to come up short. There are a number of solutions that are either dead or are not ready for production yet, such as React NodeGUI[0], Proton Native[1] or react-native-desktop-qt[2].<p>There&#x27;s react-native-windows, but I&#x27;m not running Windows, and even if that did gain Linux compatibility it seems that they&#x27;re quite focused on Microsoft-owned platforms.<p>Is &quot;just stick Chromium into all your apps&quot; seriously the best we can do as an industry? It&#x27;s resource-inefficient to high heaven, not to mention that it&#x27;s slow and doesn&#x27;t integrate with the native platform styles at all. As a JavaScript developer, I&#x27;m quite surprised this is the best there is for cross-platform JavaScript development.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nodegui&#x2F;react-nodegui\n[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proton-native.js.org&#x2F;\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;status-im&#x2F;react-native-desktop-qt",
