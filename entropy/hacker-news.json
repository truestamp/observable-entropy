Are there any engineers currently based in Switzerland than can shed some light on the current state of the job market there?<p>1. Are engineers in demand to begin with?\n2. We&#x27;re aware of how expensive Switzerland can be. Do the jobs pay well enough?\n3. Even more interestingly - what&#x27;s the current attitude in Switzerland towards 100% remote work? Is it primary office-based over there? What&#x27;s the work culture like?<p>Any insights are much appreciated.",
