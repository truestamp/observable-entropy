What platform do use and why? I’ve seen appsumo, gumroad and what appeared to be self host&#x2F;build in that post and related links off of it.<p>2. How are you getting paid ( through the platform&#x2F; through Stripe)<p>3. Can you move your content from your current platform or did the terms mean you cannot?<p>4. Any other advice?<p>Am I gonna make real money if the digital products are good (market will tell yes yes!) or is this something that only works with loyal followers or those with great creds?",
