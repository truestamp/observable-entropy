      "text": "In CLRS (as recently as the fourth edition), a &quot;complete k-ary tree&quot; is defined as a tree in which &quot;all leaves have the same depth and all internal nodes have degree k&quot;.<p>Knuth (as well as nearly every other source I&#x27;m aware of) uses an entirely different definition: &quot;a k-ary tree in which all levels are filled except possibly the last, and in the last level, all nodes (which must be leaves) are as far to the left as possible&quot;.<p>One consequence is that the Knuth definition allows leaves at different depths. For example, a tree with two nodes: one root and a child, is a complete binary tree according to Knuth, but not according to CLRS.<p>I emailed the authors of CLRS a few months ago before the fourth edition was released, and was told that they acknowledge the difference, but did not have space to mention it because they were up against a publisher-enforced page count.",

      "text": "I’ve switched jobs recently. I have been working at my new place for around 4 months. Company is 100% remote. Managers of all the tech department areas were doing some sort of “socializing events” on Fridays for their teams since the pandemic started; basically: coffee session in the morning, share your lunch at midday and games and chatting on the afternoon. These were all optional, but I felt somehow obliged to attend at least one or two of them every Friday. All of this, of course with the goal of: work life balance, keeping us social and mentally healthy, etc. Last week, the CEO decided to give us Fridays free. He said, “well, what’s better for your well being? A Friday full of rituals or a Friday entirely for yourselves? If you want to hangout with colleagues on your free Friday, you still can do it!” And so, I don’t work anymore on Fridays (salary unaffected).<p>P.S. everything is true, except the part about having Fridays free.",
