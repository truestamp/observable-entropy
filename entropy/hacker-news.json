I looked at Brainstorming apps and all I see is  mindmapping app, and while I also likke mindmapping it&#x27;s not brainstorming. Sorry.<p>Back in my days of iPad I used Notability and it was great, but now I don&#x27;t want yet another device (iPad) in order to use 1 app (Notability).<p>I am using Google Docs now (and some Google sheets), but is there a bette Brainstorming app out there? Or a Notability alternative for Android?",
