      "text": "The DevOps &quot;guru&quot; at the bank I work for (hence big and slow organization, although we are not that bad compared to other Swedish banks) comes up with bright and shining ideas every once in a while. Our biggest challenge is scaling DevSecOps and Agile, we tried SAFe and then an internal toned down version of it. Many teams got DevSecOps education and many are moving in the right way but probably not fast enough and without uniform direction.<p>This guy&#x27;s latest initiative is &quot;Ops as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (Platform)&quot; or alternatively &quot;SRE Team (Google Model)&quot; [1] also known as Platform Ops. Usually most of his claims are ending with &quot;and Gartner recommends that&quot; without any evidence or meaningful explanations.<p>The way I see Platform Ops is &quot;In short, let’s not get hung up on creating a ‘culture of DevOps’, but instead focus on targeting and improving capabilities that allow us to deliver code to production faster and more reliably. More importantly, let’s provide value to the firm’s profits, productivity and customer satisfaction.&quot; [2] which I think is totally wrong for the long run, it practically means ditching the DevOps culture and focusing only on the technicalities- upper management might see an immediate value but it will probably fade out and we will soon be back in the non Agile, non DevOps world.<p>What do you think?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.devopstopologies.com&#x2F;\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;6point6ltd.medium.com&#x2F;why-you-should-care-about-platform-ops-ee3d953df43f",
