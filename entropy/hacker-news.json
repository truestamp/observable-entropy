      "text": "In my experience in the machine learning field I have seen that many teams are not leveraging the full potential of the technology. In the majority of the cases I see, people deploy models in batch jobs, what is often called &quot;batch prediction&quot;.<p>Although I agree that this is useful for some specific cases (keep it simple), I suspect that often the decision was made because of engineering limitations, and not because it was the best for the project.<p>If you deploy ML models, please share what&#x27;s the model deployment strategy you&#x27;re using (batch, online or event-based) and why you decided going with it.<p>ps.: my team and I are working in an end-to-end serverless platform for ML, so your inputs will help us shape the product.",
