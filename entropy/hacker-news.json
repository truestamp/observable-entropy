You have to chat to an agent that has to convince you Comcast style why you shouldn&#x27;t cancel.<p>Funny enough, they&#x27;d put a &quot;cancel&quot; button and then a popup shows up telling you to chat to an agent.<p>Granted chatting with the &quot;agent&quot; took about 5 mins, but it&#x27;s still kind of a sh!tty pattern.<p>If I can enroll online by clicking through and filling out my info, I should be able to cancel just as easily, not be coerced into chatting with an &quot;agent&quot;.",
