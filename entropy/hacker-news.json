      "text": "I have 10+ years of experience with MS SQL Server, doing moderately-advanced tasks such as tuning queries and indexes, managing replication and high availability, etc. I&#x27;m looking to learn more about PostgreSQL, but if possible I&#x27;d love to be able to piggyback on the broader RDBMS knowledge I already have. For example, I understand the broad principles of how indexes work from my experience with MSSQL, but I know that in Postgres the specific implementation will be significantly different.<p>I&#x27;m hoping for some recommendations for learning Postgres that can take my existing knowledge into account, so I&#x27;m not starting from scratch. I&#x27;m interested in understanding how the engine works, as opposed to differences in syntax. In other words, explanations of PostgreSQL internals, or if such a thing exists, a comparison with SQL Server. Of course, if there are specific reasons why it might be better to start from scratch, I&#x27;d be interested to hear those too.",
