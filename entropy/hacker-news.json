I&#x27;d like to ask HN readers for their views on my hopeless(?) situation.<p>Am an ex-solicitor. I got out of UK jail a couple of years ago, I did some whitecollar stuff and I have a permanently un-unspent conviction for money-laundering. I&#x27;m over 60 with law &amp; a science degree plus several post-grad qualifications. I&#x27;m currently doing a masters in data science for interest. I used to be a programmer back in the 80s and keep up with the topic (Erlang, OCaml, F#, Python Golang etc).<p>I&#x27;ll never pass jobs with DBS checks due to convictions. plus I guess I&#x27;ll never get a job coding due to ageism (I&#x27;d wondered about COBOL but banks and government wouldn&#x27;t take me), and I dont fancy doing all the BS prep needed for interviews anyway. But I like stats ML and data so I&#x27;d love to try for that. But the age and convictions are a serious problems.<p>I don&#x27;t imagine anyone on HN has anyone with my collection of problems but does anyone have any suggestions that might help?",
