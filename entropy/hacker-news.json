      "text": "For context, there’s a 231+ page thread on MacRumors of people complaining and troubleshooting the issue of excessive heat&#x2F;fan noise when using specifically their 2019 16&quot; MBP’s while plugged into external monitors of certain resolutions&#x2F;frame rates, even at idle with nothing running.<p>The root cause was a bad GPU driver. Throughout the years, people have tried various workarounds, like using the laptop in clamshell mode, force enabling HiDPI mode for the monitor, using Monterey&#x27;s Low Power Mode. (Some solutions of which I discovered myself.)<p>But now, this issue is fixed by Monday&#x27;s macOS update, no workaround needed! People have been celebrating in the aforementioned MacRumors thread. In Big Sur and earlier, idle GPU usage was ~18W. This is insane power draw at idle. In earlier version of Monterey, ~14W. Using low power mode, ~6W, but this required compromises like disabling CPU turboboost which may matter for some workflows.<p>But now in Monterey 12.3, it&#x27;s now ~6W straight up, no compromises or workarounds or fiddling with settings needed!<p>No longer do I have to deal with loud fans at idle with just a monitor attached or extremely loud fans when doing simple stuff like zoom calls and screen shares. So if you have this model MacBook, go update to 12.3!",
