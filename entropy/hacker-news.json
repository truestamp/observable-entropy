I know that in 2017 many shady ICOs occurred, and there must have been many shady ICO consultants&#x2F;builders, but the value of raising funds and building communities in a decentralized way seems enormous.<p>Are there any companies working as a sort of &quot;investment bank&quot; for ICOs? Where they build ICOs&#x2F;NFTs for scientific orgs, charities, etc?<p>One way to incentivize alignment is to have the ICO builder recieve a small portion of the ICO in place of a normal fee.<p>Would love some clarity, pointers around this.",
