In other words, if you quit your job at  <i>Remote Work Skeptics Inc</i> last December for a new position at <i>Remote Work Rules LLC</i>, please choose &quot;My job was fully remote before the pandemic&quot;, and not &quot;rarely remote &#x2F; fully remote&quot;.<p>(My reasoning for doing it this way: some people may be planning to switch jobs, and some plans will pan out, and others won&#x27;t. Both questions are interesting, but I had to pick one, and this seemed more reliable.)",
