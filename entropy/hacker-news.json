      "text": "The issue with productivity timers is that it has to be manually started, The issue with getting immersed with work before a computer is that it easily leads to sedentary lifestyle; To address these two problems I made https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttmover.com where the productivity timer gets automatically triggered when we sit on the chair and we&#x27;re reminded to take a walk when it completes.<p>The Butt Trigger is a simple ESP8266 button-switch which is DIY as its just off the shelf parts, Because I cannot build it at scale due to my disability and even if I do, shipping such niche products from my country is a nightmare.<p>But my audience aren&#x27;t necessarily DIY enthusiasts and so to address this my plan is to enable those who could build the Butt Tigger and list them as sellers for their region on Butt Mover(All profit from sale of Butt Trigger is theirs).<p>To make things easier, The firmware flashing and communication happens through Butt Mover via web-serial and so they have nothing to do with the code.<p>But how do I go about finding such DIFO (Do It For Others) builders? Has anyone attempted such a strategy for selling DIY products? Is there a better alternative?",
