Similar things happen when I&#x27;m on Wikipedia and open many tabs, as I&#x27;m sure many of you on HN do.<p>So do you folks have any tips, techniques, or even philosophies on managing these lines of inquiry and staying focused on the intended material (without simply ignoring those lines of inquiry)?",
