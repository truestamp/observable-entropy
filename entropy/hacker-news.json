You&#x27;d think the big G would be doing something intelligent here like an exponential backoff.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think that the hope behind all this pestering is that I&#x27;ll eventually fat-finger the wrong option, and then forget to cancel the service.<p>Is there any way to get whatever algorithm is targeting me to, well, stop asking? At least for a while?",

      "text": "I am building an online marketplace for service providers. The service provider will have the option of two profiles, basic vs. premium profile.\nMy current thoughts on pricing structure are as follows.<p>Basic Profile - Limited feature set - Free + transaction fee<p>Premium Profile - Full feature set - $25 a month + smaller transaction fee<p>How large should transaction fees be in order to not have vendors move off platform &#x2F; be discouraged from working with us but still enough to make some money? What’s the sweet spot?<p>Should the transaction fee be taken from the vendor side or on the customer side as an additional charge at checkout?<p>Should there be a small flat fee put on transactions?<p>Any other things &#x2F; options to do?<p>Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated",
