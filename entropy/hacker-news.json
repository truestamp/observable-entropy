      "text": "I know that righteous indignation is the new national pastime, but I would find it a lot more interesting to hear a more nuanced discussion from this community on the topic of self-driving.<p>Some questions that come to mind:<p>- Would it contribute positively to our world if competent self driving existed?<p>- What are the various approaches to get from here to there, and what are their relative merits and risks?<p>- Assuming some approach showed promise, how should we expose it to real world conditions to allow for validation and ongoing improvement?<p>- Do the technically-savvy folks on this list think that a heuristic approach (i.e. a bunch of rules written by humans) could ever succeed at effective self driving in diverse conditions?  Or is the machine learning + massive data approach more likely to solve it?  Or do you consider it fundamentally unsolveable?<p>- What interesting moral and legal questions arise if effective self-driving becomes available?<p>- What might be the economic and environmental ramifications of a world with ubiquitous “robotaxis”?<p>Anyone care to pick one and take a swing at it?",

(It&#x27;s a site that recommends various resources to teach yourself everything you need to know to become a true software engineer. Or set yourself up to become one, rather. )<p>However, I already found myself with some questions and I was wondering if there was a community (or whether somebody wants to create one with me) for people who are on the same path.<p>I have little prior experience but I&#x27;m very curious about CS, programming and cybersecurity. So I&#x27;d like it to be a group that is comfortable with slow learning and basic questions. Or even figuring out how to re-learn high-school math in order to progress to CS-level math.<p>If anybody is interested I will post my e-mail, but maybe there is something similiar already out there.",
