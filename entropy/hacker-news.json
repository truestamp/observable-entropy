      "text": "Hello all!<p>Last year we decided to open our internal DevOps workshops to everyone and we had our first DevOps League event, which was a big success (unfortunately it was in Greek, but still a big success!)<p>This time around we decided to go global (all presentations will be in English), go bigger (4 different companies will participate) and explore the exciting ecosystem of Terraform in a ~5h event. We&#x27;ll start small with the foundations and work ourselves to the top in terms of complexity and best practises.<p>If you want to join us on 22th of November, feel free to register at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;globalwebindex.zoom.us&#x2F;webinar&#x2F;register&#x2F;9516366272258&#x2F;WN_SgkXTQZdSlmM5R50295S-A or spread the word if you know anyone who might be interested. Attendance is free, and the whole event is a labor of love from various DevOps in different companies.",
