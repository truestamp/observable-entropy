      "text": "I fell victim to a scam involving a fake forex broker. Since then I&#x27;ve identified many sites they run. It appears their main backend server is hosted in China, I tried reporting to the abuse contact listed on arin and they didn&#x27;t take action. Neither did the domain registrars involved. In addition, I traced my btc to the exchange huobi and haven&#x27;t gotten a single response out of them.<p>What other steps can I take?",
