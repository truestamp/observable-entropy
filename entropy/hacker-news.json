      "text": "Russian outlet Vedomosti.ru today is reporting that the conglomerate Rostec, a Russian state-backed corporation specializing in investment in technology, has penned a deal with server company Yadro and silicon design company Syntacore to develop RISC-V processors for computers, laptops, and servers. Initial reports are suggesting that Syntacore will develop a powerful enough RISC-V design to power government and education systems by 2025.<p>More at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16827&#x2F;russia-to-build-riscv-processors-for-laptops-8core-2-ghz-12nm-2025<p>or original link https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vedomosti.ru&#x2F;technology&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;878092-rosteh-razrabotaet-protsessori, in Russian.",

      "text": "Hello everyone, I&#x27;m a maintainer at the PixiJS project. I fix bugs very often and to do so I have to setup a reproduction of the bug locally - that usually means copying code from an online IDE and linking it to the local build of PixiJS. I thought this process could be automated, and I wanted to know how useful it would be for other people.<p>Example command: fiddle download &lt;URL&gt;<p>This command would setup a mini webpack project, possibly linked to local builds of any dependencies (otherwise, downloaded using npm). You can run the project using another command like &quot;npm run start&quot;.<p>If you think this is useful, would you pay and how much?",
