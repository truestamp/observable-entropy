I can&#x27;t flag, unlike every other article, but I can hide. It looks so weird, and it happens with this one company so often. I&#x27;m very curious what I&#x27;m missing.<p>What is making it so that this company is able to post onto the front page in slot 14 despite seeming to have zero upvotes and no comments? Are they just a Y Combinator company with special posting privileges? Does this treatment apply to other websites?<p>It&#x27;s very strange to see the 14th ranked story on the front page a simple link to a page with job openings that aren&#x27;t even particularly special. It seems like they are somehow using HN as if it were LinkedIn and it&#x27;s very sketchy looking.",
