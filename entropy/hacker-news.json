      "text": "I&#x27;ve finally become proficient with Tailwind CSS.<p>However, my sites still look <i>ok</i>. I&#x27;ve adopted the idea of &quot;use different shades gray to make UIs&quot; and, as a result, my sites look... professional but uninviting.<p>Consider sites like:<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curius.app&#x2F;<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.focusmate.com&#x2F;<p>These sites look warm and inviting. Being proficient with Tailwind CSS just helps me have good padding, margins, and a reasonable default color scheme. It doesn&#x27;t help me make my site look... human.<p>I feel like I need a &quot;design palette&quot; instead of a mere &quot;color&#x2F;margin palette&quot;. What&#x27;s the recommendation for this?",

      "text": "I like to think I can manage boredom with my smartphone. I mindlessly scroll social media and get my giggles when I&#x27;m bored. But it has a law of diminishing returns. Eventually I just get sick of social media and the Internet in general. It doesn&#x27;t spark the same joy. I walk a good distance everyday which helps &amp; gets me back into creative mode when I need to work on a side project.<p>Like what even is boredom? I&#x27;ve looked it up, but the term for me is a lot deeper. I get very deep boredom or extreme boredom to the point I have to go outside for a walk just to do <i>something</i>, even if there is no goal other than to walk.<p>What do you do, to defeat boredom? I&#x27;d like to hear your thoughts!",
