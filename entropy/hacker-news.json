I&#x27;m at the first year of my studies.\nI&#x27;d like to ask you for advice on how to make the most out of the time during my studies, so that I won&#x27;t have trouble with employment.<p>What are some of the things that would make me stand out from the rest of the potential candidates in the future?\nI&#x27;m partaking in one of the scientific clubs, where our main focus is game development. In my team, I fulfill the role of 3D artist with occasional programming sprinkled in.<p>Should I be focusing on my GitHub portfolio? What ought to be my main focus?",
