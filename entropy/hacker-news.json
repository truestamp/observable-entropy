      "text": "I have been working as a software engineer for the past 10 years (just after getting my degree in Computer Science). I like to believe I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of programming and software engineering: from automata theory, to compilers, generics, OOP, functional programming, SOLID, MVC, etc. I have read almost all the &quot;N books every software engineer must read&quot;. I have been working with multiple programming languages and frameworks and in a variety of sectors (fin tech, e-commerce, automobile, etc.) While I can setup servers and databases (e.g., the typical nginx + mysql + ssh keys + ansible + bash scripting + a bit of terraform), infra topics is not my A game. I have been looking at the market (I would like to switch jobs) and 9 out of 10 job descriptions for senior backend engineers include in their &quot;must&quot; section knowledge about infrastructure topics such as Docker, K8s, GCP&#x2F;AWS, CI&#x2F;CD. Five or 10 years ago such topics were stated in the &quot;nice to have&quot; section of tech job descriptions for senior software engineers. Nowadays, it seems that companies care more about you being able to pack your code in a Docker image using GitLab CI&#x2F;CD pipeline and write yaml files to describe the state of your K8s cluster.<p>Companies seem to value much more knowledge about GCP than functional programming or OOP. &quot;Oh, you know why one should not parse HTML using regular expressions? Well, that&#x27;s cute, but do you know how to setup oauth2-proxy in our K8s cluster? You don&#x27;t? Oh well, thank you for coming.&quot;",
