      "text": "What&#x27;s a useful gift to give to a programmer? I am trying to think of something that they will either use daily, or increase their knowledge&#x2F;productivity. Budget $100USD. I was thinking one-off&#x2F;non-subscription high-quality paid utilities, e.g. diff tools such as Beyond Compare, HFS+ file system driver etc. I also considered courses&#x2F;ebooks but generally I feel that, unless these are the highest quality, utilities will be more often used. Anyway, all suggestions welcome, regardless of targeted developer platform&#x2F;domain.",
