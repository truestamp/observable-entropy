      "text": "Here’s an application that I can’t believe doesn’t exist and I would love to see. I call it the conditional smart clock. Basically, an alarm clock that allows you to set some simple conditions to determine when it rings. Say I’m an avid runner (i’m not), the clock would allow me to specify that I want to be woken up at 6am <i>unless</i> it&#x27;s raining in which case I would like to sleep in until 8. Or I wanna get up early for a surf unless the local beach is closed in which case getting up early will be pointless. Obviously not perfect - but having the ability to do this with some level of accuracy would be helpful. Amazingly brief desktop search has only shown hyper-specific examples including one for a school district in Colorado that keeps track of school closures etc. Been trying to teach my Google Assistant to recognize this in the faint hope that human overseers will pick it up and think its a good idea :-) but to no avail. Seriously if you are a developer, I haven’t met anyone who I&#x27;ve told who doesn&#x27;t think this is a good idea - can you please develop something like this so I can start using this (fwiw I’m a data person, whose skills would mostly be in back end development for which an app like this doesn’t necessarily have much use)",
