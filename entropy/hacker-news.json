Think twice before relying on it in production.<p>The idea is that we can perform a detailed validation of the trustworthiness of an absolute or relative path, as a simple function that can be reused anywhere: I call this function safepath_check.<p>A trustworthy path is one whose meaning cannot be changed by a third party: another user who isn&#x27;t root.<p>The path is therefore immune, for instance, to TOCtoTOU security problems, like the insertion of a symbolic link or other tampering.<p>A trustworthy path is allowed to contain symbolic links. Symbolic links can be validated to be safe. To that end, safepath_check performs its own symlink resolution, to ensure that every link resolution step substitutes path material that is trustworthy.",

      "text": "This may be a naive question, but...<p>Cloud-first costs a lot of money. If your startup is doing something compute heavy, like ML or serving a lot of bandwidth, you&#x27;re going to have to pay boatloads just to even serve low DAU.<p>I&#x27;ll give an example:<p>Imagine you wanted to recreate some video upload&#x2F;streaming app. Fastly charges $0.12&#x2F;gb, AWS charges $0.05&#x2F;gb (and this is me being generous, they only give you this rate <i>after</i> 150tb&#x2F;month of volume).<p>1080p video uses about 25mb a minute. That means streaming a 5 minute video will use about 125mb of bandwidth, ~1&#x2F;10th of a gigabyte, meaning just to stream a 5 minute 1080p video, at the bare minimum you have just spent $0.005. If this video gets 10,000 views, that is a $50 video.<p>I realize that&#x27;s a fairly contrived scenario, and I&#x27;m going to be bombarded by people telling me X CDN offers Y bandwidth for cheaper or for much better price (spoiler alert: They don&#x27;t. CDNs like Cloudflare actually don&#x27;t allow dynamically generated user content or media).<p>I&#x27;ve rambled on my example enough. Bandwidth costs a lot of money, especially in the cloud world. But I&#x27;m sure I could setup some racks in various metros and pay way less than what I would have to on the cloud.<p>Whenever I see this mentioned on HN, people bring out their pitchforks. &quot;But... Cloud is cheaper!!! Infra is cheap! Engineers are expensive!!&quot; Yeah, I agree, in <i>most</i> scenarios, but there are some cases where cloud costs are just too ravaging to bear.<p>TLDR: The cloud-first culture is probably prohibiting a lot of startup ideas. I know I personally have not pursued some ideas just cause I know the infra costs would be gnarly. I don&#x27;t think the next TikTok, YouTube, or whatever could be bootstrapped, even with a $500k seed round, if you experience any volume of users that will be eaten away quickly.",
