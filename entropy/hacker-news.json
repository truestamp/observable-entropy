I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m noticing it more because it&#x27;s resonating with me or are these issues becoming more prominent. I feel like the general sentiment here is atheism and maybe nihilism from people in tech who have more money than they need and now they don&#x27;t know what to do next. It could be it&#x27;s just me projecting as well. What I&#x27;m asking myself is is it becoming unhealthy for me to come here every day and read about these topics because they could be amplifying my own issues and there isn&#x27;t really an answer to these questions.",
