      "text": "I am attempting to complete a MS in CS part-time and am struggling with the workload alongside a full time job and hobbies. The main issue is I am not sure if this is a worthwhile endeavor at this point.<p>I am young, and my job role is already lightly CS-related (data). I have an undergraduate minor in CS, so I have taken Data Structures, Discrete Structures, AI, etc. I don&#x27;t think I want to be a SWE, I am mainly pursuing this degree for personal knowledge (to enable side projects and satisfy interest) and to make my profile more appealing to large tech companies and startups.<p>Is a masters worth it? Or would it be more worth it to try to build knowledge through side projects &#x2F; a blog if I can trust myself to remain committed?",
