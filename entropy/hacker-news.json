I need a way to track reach + community engagement on social media.<p>Our community is on fire and people are writing blog posts and doing review videos about us. But I don&#x27;t have a single graph right now that tracks this. We already raised our seed round but we&#x27;re getting questions from major VCs today about the growing community. It&#x27;s important we have something numeric that we can track and show for the A round.<p>Any recommendations for tools to track this?<p>edit: to be more specific, we&#x27;d like to track LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack statistics, social media mentions, YouTube views, and GitHub engagement. Open to more ideas for what we should track too. We do <i>not</i> need to track specific users - we just need the overall statistics.",
