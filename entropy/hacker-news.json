This update is meant to clarify, and in some cases expand, our publisher guidance as it relates to this conflict.<p>This pause includes, but is not limited to, claims that imply victims are responsible for their own tragedy or similar instances of victim blaming, such as claims that Ukraine is committing genocide or deliberately attacking its own citizens.<p>Sincerely,\nThe Google AdSense Team",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed more and more startups talk about the edge.  Or edge-computing.  I&#x27;ll be honest: I struggle with edge a lot.  I find it hard to see what the concept solves.  Maybe it&#x27;s a bit like someone describing distributed computing to 1960s programmers.<p>I get the fundamentals sure: latency, cross-region, cost control (scaling in when demand recedes), etc.<p>Those are things everyone can get with any of the cloud providers already.<p>So, what slice of an app makes sense to run on some edge when the core runs in data-center?  And what characteristics do most of those slices have?  Is the bulk of the edge workload stateless and ephemeral?  Is it mostly to improve shopping experiences? Is it just so new no one knows?",

      "text": "Inspired by an AskHN from a few days ago about working for &quot;boring&quot; companies.<p>I really enjoy the process of optimizing software, making it more reliable, faster, smaller code size, anything where a particular metric can be targeted and challenging yourself to hit that target or conclude it&#x27;s impossible to hit after doing the math out and trying many possible paths.<p>The problem is, how do I go about finding jobs like this? It seems many dev jobs are focused on adding more features, but not optimizing the prior features. It&#x27;s disappointing adding a new feature that I know will always be half baked, since I don&#x27;t get to test the limits of the problem that particular feature is trying to solve. Any advice?",
