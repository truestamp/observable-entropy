I&#x27;m curious to know how, someone like me, is handling the customer support.<p>I receive an average of 15-20 user emails per day, 70% of them asking for the same information on the website FAQs. I reply to them with the templated responses. Is there a reliable tool to automate responses for such emails based on the questions? The remaining 30% are generic questions related to the provided service and some involve updating the subscriptions.",
