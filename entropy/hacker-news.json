      "text": "My partner incorporated a C-Corp in Delaware Apr 2019 and was supposed to get me added as Director from Sept 2019 but he fooled me by just getting me to sign stock purchase agreement and 83B election. He kept telling me that i am a director in the US company while i was working from India as employee of indian subsidiary of the US parent. Now he has absconded (he is CEO, Director, Secretary, Treasurer) from last 2-3 months, not picking my calls or responding to emails and not giving any update on the company financials, progress, operations. He has not given me my share vesting certificate too and has not done a single board meeting in last 2.5 yrs. He is also not giving me access to the company CPA for my audit. What are my rights to escalate to Delaware authorities as major shareholder. I was fooled as i am not US citizen. What action can i take as major shareholder for violation of my rights via Delaware authorities?",
