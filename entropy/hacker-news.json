Seems like I could at least study other people solving interesting problems. Better than the mostly configuration and infrastructure work I do now. Not sure what will be involved in the role (reached out to the manager for info). Seems like most of the team members have prestigious degrees (Wharton MBA, etc) with a heavy finance background.",
