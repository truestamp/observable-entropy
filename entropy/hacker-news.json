We value you as a user, and apologize for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused.\n&gt; After reviewing your account activity, we’ve removed the ban so you should now have access to WhatsApp. As a next step, we recommend re-registering your phone number on WhatsApp to ensure you have access. You can visit our website to download WhatsApp or the WhatsApp Business app.\n&gt; You can learn more about how to use WhatsApp responsibly in this Help Center article.\n&gt; Note: We don’t provide support for unsupported apps, devices, or versions of WhatsApp, or jailbroken or rooted devices. Learn more about our supported operating systems in this article. For more information about unofficial apps and why we don’t support these apps, you can refer to this article.<p>Naturally no explanation of what account activity supposedly triggered the ban, and the bit about how to use WhatsApp responsibly sounds like them implying that something was done wrong, but at least the ban was reversed.",
