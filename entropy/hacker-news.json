      "text": "I lost a lot of my social circle over COVID. I&#x27;ve maintained some &quot;one-off&quot; friendships, but a general sense of community is totally gone, and I don&#x27;t know where to go to find it:<p>Work: there&#x27;s probably mixed feelings on whether you <i>ought</i> to rely on work for a sense of community. I&#x27;m personally very for this, but even when things were &quot;back&quot;, they weren&#x27;t &quot;back&quot; for tech jobs. I work on a team that&#x27;s mostly west-coast based (I&#x27;m east coast), but even if I moved or changed teams or companies, it seems like so many offices still have so many people WFH that it&#x27;s hard to find a sense of community there.<p>Hobbies: Spending just a few hours a week on something, I imagine it&#x27;s pretty hard to form deep connections. There&#x27;s also the fact that when I&#x27;m pursuing a hobby <i>for the sake of</i> community, it&#x27;s probably not a hobby I was especially interested in or excited about to start with, which further limits how connected I&#x27;ll feel to the other people partaking. At any rate, for whatever reason, hobbies I&#x27;ve tried to pursue haven&#x27;t really led to many strong connections at all, let alone a sense of community.<p>Religion: I wish I were religious, because I do believe this can be a strong source of community too, but I&#x27;m not, and I don&#x27;t think you can really &quot;fake&quot; your way through it.<p>Family: I&#x27;m single, my family is pretty small, and for whatever reason I don&#x27;t feel especially close to them. We&#x27;re not especially distant, it&#x27;s not like things are bad, but for whatever reason the connections there just aren&#x27;t that strong. (It&#x27;s somewhere on the list of things to talk about with my therapist...)<p>School: I&#x27;ve thought of going to grad school as a way to get a sense of community. Even if it were to work, it seems like a steep cost to pay if that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m doing it. And I&#x27;ve had friends that have tried this with middling success: I get the sense people in grad school don&#x27;t want&#x2F;try to socialize as much as people in undergrad.<p>The military&#x2F;peace corps: I&#x27;m more confident this would work than school, but seems like an even larger life disruption. And it also has the downside that the community likely isn&#x27;t transferrable after&#x2F;if I leave the military.<p>Roommates&#x2F;shared living: The one thing I&#x27;m maybe reasonably optimistic about? I&#x27;m skeptical of how <i>strong</i> a sense of community it would create, but when my lease is up I definitely want to try to stop living alone. I&#x27;d even be open to some kind of commune&#x2F;hacker-house kind of thing, though I&#x27;m not sure how common those are (still are) around where I live.<p>I know this reads a bit defeatist, but I think I am genuinely trying to look for solutions here. I also realize how &quot;clinical&quot; this can come off as, but I think I need to start being more purposeful and directed about this: 2 years of &quot;just waiting for it to happen&quot; hasn&#x27;t really worked. Waiting for work to get &quot;back to usual&quot; is what I&#x27;m most banking on right now, and I&#x27;m not sure when or if that&#x27;ll happen.",
