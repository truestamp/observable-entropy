      "text": "Mau is a lightweight markup language heavily inspired by AsciiDoc that makes it a breeze to write blog posts or books. If you already know Markdown or AsciiDoc you already know which type of software Mau is, and you will quickly learn its syntax.<p>The main goal of Mau, however, is to provide a customisable markup language. While Mau&#x27;s syntax is fixed by its implementation, its output is created through user-provided templates. This strategy gives the user great flexibility with no added complexity.<p>I currently use Mau to write posts for my blog The Digital Cat (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedigitalcatonline.com&#x2F;) and to write my book Clean Architectures in Python 9https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;clean-architectures-in-python). The Mau documentation is also written using Mau.<p>Source code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Project-Mau&#x2F;mau<p>Official documentation: The Mau book at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedigitalcatbooks.com&#x2F;",
