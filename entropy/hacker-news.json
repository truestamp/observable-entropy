However, when I strated reading up on authn&#x2F;z, i realized that there are way too many strategies and options and I am ill equipped to choose \\from among them.<p>I just want a &quot;Sign in with Apple&quot; and &quot;Google Sign in&quot; buttons in my app. I would also want the solution to handle sessions and cookies.<p>Essentially, I want my auth solution to handle everything related to user identity and just return a userid&#x2F;email identifier that I can use in my db queries.<p>What is a simple and OSS solution that you would recommend for this?",
