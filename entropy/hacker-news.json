This update is meant to clarify, and in some cases expand, our publisher guidance as it relates to this conflict.<p>This pause includes, but is not limited to, claims that imply victims are responsible for their own tragedy or similar instances of victim blaming, such as claims that Ukraine is committing genocide or deliberately attacking its own citizens.<p>Sincerely,\nThe Google AdSense Team",
