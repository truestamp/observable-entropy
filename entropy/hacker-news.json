      "text": "A few days ago, I read that math is not that much important of you want to be a computer scientist.<p>I read this sentence as a provocation and caught me so much that I&#x27;m still thinking about it.<p>I studied math and computer science and I strongly believe that having a math background helps you a lot to reason about a problem and formalize the solution. I do believe math can help you to implement some clean code, e.g., that solves a problem without a bunch of if else statements (or to identify state machines where they are not so easily spotted).<p>In my experience, math helped me a lot, even though so far I never implemented compilers, interpreters or defined new languages (tasks where most of scientists agree that having a math background helps).<p>What do you think: is learning math useful to be a good computer scientist?",
