      "text": "For the last two companies I’ve worked for we’ve had to build a custom service and UI for managing config for our customers. This config isn’t for service&#x2F;platform use but for toggling and configuring various features that are built for customers. These sort of settings are only updated internally so there’s not much reason to spend front end engineer time building a nice UI&#x2F;UX just for the controls.<p>Reason I’m asking is I’m considering building something generic to solve this problem, with a UI that can support user permissions, audit trail, and a very simple way to add new config where controls will be generated from the schema. I’d imagine it might also be useful to cover feature flagging too, where a feature flag is an option in the config schema (which could support AB testing&#x2F;rolling deployment).",
