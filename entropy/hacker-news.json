      "text": "I found it incredibly terrible to have no reliable Internet in times of remote work, and doing technical sales over VOIP, or video.<p>Stuttering, bad microphones on 9 out of 10 consumer gear having them, laggy&#x2F;blurry web cameras, and the biggest one, packet loss, completely annihilate that image of confidence that a technical salesman should irradiate.<p>Having video calls, especially to 3rd world countries gradually turn to schmoo as you go into deal details, having to switch to audio only, which then automatically turns off the loudspeaker, and long field microphone, only to have to switch to a POTS, and realise it&#x27;s suffering the same issue due to it coming over internet in the country is an ultimately frustrating experience for both you, and the prospective client.<p>On the opposite end, having an extra premium experience of shining HD image, and loud crystal clear voice helps you to project your image. I believe this alone can give you 20%-30% extra chance to bring the client on your side.<p>Purposeful VOIP packet shaping is the ultimate evil.",
