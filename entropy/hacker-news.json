      "text": "I’ve been holding out for the new 16” MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon, however recently the new Dell XPS 15 (9510) reviews have caught my attention. WSl2 has made a pretty compelling case for Windows (So I’m happy to make the jump to Windows). While I’d love to run Linux on my daily driver I can’t go without the Adobe CC Suite or Outlook. With a bit of discount stacking I’ve managed to get the price down on a pretty well specced 9510. I’m also having my doubts about the current state of Apple Silicon when it comes to being suitable as a primary dev machine.<p>So, I’m curious to know what you are all currently daily driving as a development laptop? Are there any other business style laptops that fall within the same XPS 15’s tier that you’d recommend? I’ve had a look at Lenovo’s and HP’s offerings and honestly I’ve found their current product suite lacking when it comes to features and price.",
