      "text": "I&#x27;m starting to realize that I&#x27;m a mediocre yet &quot;smart&quot; developer who might not be cut out for doing this long term.  I find reading about software really interesting, built a number of my own apps, was able to pick up elixir professionally quite quickly and design some cool things at my last job.  However, I can&#x27;t for the life of me get into a place where interviewing seems natural at all and still after four years of experience struggle to get through medium leetcode problems.<p>I&#x27;ve had a taste of the &quot;strategy&quot; or &quot;product&quot; side of things and wonder if that&#x27;s a better path to transition to, especially since I don&#x27;t want to be a developer ten years down the road.  The thing that&#x27;s hit me the hardest is realizing I probably don&#x27;t have the chops or mental energy to do my own startup. Just working at a startup during covid caused me to burn out and basically quit to maintain sanity.<p>For those of you who left tech but still make equivalent income either on the strategy, ops side etc I&#x27;m curious of how you came to make your transition and how your path changed soon thereafter.<p>Thanks",
