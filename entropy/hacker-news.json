After finishing school, he realized that he was not interested in academia and did not want to go to graduate school.<p>He is interested in getting into engineering (SW or mech, most likely), or perhaps data analysis&#x2F;science. He has some but not tons of programming experience. Decent amount of stats experience.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has navigated a similar situation and&#x2F;or has ideas for possible paths forward.",
