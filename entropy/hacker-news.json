      "text": "This started as Ask HN but after some googling it&#x27;s now Tell HN, just wanna share my discovery, which is already well documented.. So last night due to TV&#x2F;Depression I didn&#x27;t go to bed until 5am. But then I thought I wont wake up on time so screw it I&#x27;ll just stay awake. I was fully prepared to be a zombie and expecting headaches. And headaches did start at 8am, I took a nap accidentally at 9am to 9:50am and they went away. Later today, I noticed I&#x27;m able to focus, there is huge silence in my mind, all negative thoughts are gone... I feel bit like a zombie&#x2F;fatigued but at the same time kinda hopeful, stable, content and ok. No anxiety or depressive mood, like not at all, almost scary how ok it feels, also not excited&#x2F;happy either that I think is healthier place to be.. instead of swinging between crazy happy and totally hopeless. I did more coding today than in the last 10 days. Even had an important interview and wasn&#x27;t nervous.<p>So I started to look what the heck is happening I always thought sleeping was crucial to mental health and neurons etc.<p>Turns out it&#x27;s documented<p>&quot;Sleep deprivation (SD) response shows up in the SD night or on the following day. Ten to 15% of patients respond after recovery sleep only. After recovery sleep 50-80% of day 1 responders suffer a complete or partial relapse; but improvement can last for weeks....There are, however, indications that Total Sleep Deprivation (TSD) is superior&quot;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;12531127&#x2F;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16213237<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25458755<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13845315<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26685975<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27328290",
