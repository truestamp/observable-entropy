      "text": "A quick background:\nI started learning programming for the sake of building stuff. Quite frankly even the ability to help in any way during the crisis in Europe by collating information on the web is a seriously valuable skill. It sounds trivial to many here, but just a small contribution like that seems like a superpower.<p>As a job, it doesn&#x27;t seem super enticing though. I started wondering how many people actually still do it because they enjoy it compared to &quot;out of necessity&quot;?<p>Feeling of creating something out of nothing, even super simple and uncomplicated but useful feels very rewarding...<p>Wordle is a good example of just a simple piece of software that is elegant in its own way and was created for fun instead of drilling on specifics of making something scalable or achieving an OKR. It feels like it&#x27;s a lost philosophy nowadays where everyone is chasing unicorns and money.<p>Where did all the fun go?",
