      "text": "I was recently applying for a remote job in which the interview committee informed me that as the role is remote, they are recruiting globally. I was then asked for my salary expectations.<p>I am genuinely confused as to how to answer this question: as this is a position that is hiring globally, it seems that applicants who live in regions where the cost of living is substantially lower can of course in turn list their salary expectations as much lower.<p>Logically, global-hire positions then seem to me to be a race to the bottom. If I list my salary expectations as the equivalent $20 an hour, an equally-qualified candidate who lists theirs as $10 an hour will of course logically get the job instead. So what do I do?",
