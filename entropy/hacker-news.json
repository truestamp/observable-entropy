      "text": "Every once in awhile, when I get a spam message on social media (Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, etc), I chat for a bit just to see what the strategy is, do a Turing test, etc. Typically, I used to get a few messages that mostly ignore the questions I ask, and then send me a link to some website asking for my credit card details or something. Every once in awhile, I&#x27;d find that even though it seemed to be a spam account, someone seeming to be a human being would chat with me for days. Once, I found that it was actually an ex trying to stalk me. But lately, I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of these spam accounts send a single, one word message, like &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Hola&quot; or an emoji, and then never respond to any messages, never send any links, never actively try to get anything from me at all. So my question is, is there some sort of spam or fishing strategy that I&#x27;m missing here? Am I falling for something without realizing it? Are these just lazy scammers?",
