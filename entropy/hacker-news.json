      "text": "Xcode 13.3.1 apparently fixes one bug in one commandline tool and the total download size is 12.7GB.<p>I understand that the packages are signed, but it should be possible to figure out what the user has on their system (eg, by hashes) and download only new (signed) objects in the package manifest. This is how ostree does it, for example (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ostreedev.github.io&#x2F;ostree&#x2F;).<p>I don&#x27;t understand why consuming this much bandwidth for such small changes is seen as acceptable. Bandwidth and disk space might be cheap in the developed world but it certainly isn&#x27;t everywhere else.",

(and ideally gives several examples)\nThis can go all the way back to bronze weapons losing to iron weapons, to more recently WWII being won by the first country who developed nuclear weapons.",
