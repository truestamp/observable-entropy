I&#x27;m still wrangling with the &#x27;cookies.js&#x27; file placed on the client, with a session id, otherwise it&#x27;s free of any javascript. I hadn&#x27;t used Redis in the past, had been content with sub-second page loads. Now I&#x27;m getting unbelievable (to me) results under 50ms for most pages, except 3rd party API calls for coin prices and service rates.<p>I&#x27;m getting my head around the content security policy, extracting the google fonts into my apps domain, not using analytics.<p>It&#x27;s only running on 1cpu&#x2F;1gb&#x2F;1appserver, which I&#x27;ve pared down from 4cpu&#x2F;4gb&#x2F;2appserver. So it&#x27;s $5&#x2F;mo for the VPS. I may have some knowlege to share, if you&#x27;re interested.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinship.pro",
