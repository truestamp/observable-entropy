      "text": "Hi HN<p>I work quite a lot with Python and JS, and some other higher level languages, but have recently wanted to get involved in lower level languages, particularly NIM. I have already started coding with it, but it comes with a whole range of new topics that are semi-unknown to me, heaps, stacks, memory management, pointers, compilers, debugging compiled applications, garbage collection, etc. Does anyone know of any material that can help demystify those topics and any other that come up.<p>I know the common answer will be to start coding and learn it as you go along. But I was curious to understand if there was any supplementary material that can support my introduction to this new works of coding?",
