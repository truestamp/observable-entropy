      "text": "Companies throwing $$ at for recruiting has been part of the normal ebb-and-flow of the tech industry for the past few years. Even as one company slows down hiring, another, usually pre-IPO company, is there to take its place.<p>However, with interest rates going up and funding going down, things <i>seem</i> to be tightening up.<p>So HN - Do any of y&#x27;all happen to know of any tech companies throwing $$ at candidates these days? I know the big tech companies are still pulling good numbers, for the ones that are still hiring, but I&#x27;m curious about the <i>exceptional</i> offers that we used to hear about a few years back. Have those completely dried up?<p>(Not actually asking for myself so much as to get a pulse on things.)",
