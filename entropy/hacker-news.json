Blatant such that the programmers were so careless and lazy they made nearly no attempts to cover their tracks. However, the offenders are located in a country that is known to be hostile to matters of intellectual property. Is trying to enforce the GPL in such a situation basically impossible?",

I wanted to ask… What are the most common types of tech debt you’ve seen in your companies? How do you prioritize dealing with tech debt so that the team stays productive?",

So I decided to post my own affairs.<p>I currently have 50 roles in tech; what I am doing is essentially outsourcing the labor to India, Poland, Nigeria, and Argentina. I am, basically, running an outsourcing company at this stage and have people process and handle requests in those countries and assign engineers. I learned a ton about quality control and am making 7.5M a year. I am able to juggle the work because most of my gigs are in startups and meetings rarely happen so i&#x27;m pretty much running on autopilot.",
