Unfortunately its unpaid though, which has made me realize how valuable it is to me to have a source of income.<p>Not sure how difficult it is to get a part-time paid internship during the school year but that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m looking into. I&#x27;m also curious about smart contract development because firstly I think it&#x27;s cool but I also hear that there&#x27;s money to be made there. Advice?",
