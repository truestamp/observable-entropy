      "text": "I was sitting on my porch just now and this fresh breeze came through, lifting my mood immensely. I looked up and sniffed, and the air was so fresh and beautiful, it reminded me of something long ago that I loved. I got more focused, smelled the air, identified the components; and it was a sea-breeze. My porch is 250mi from the nearest coast, but the breeze was unmistakeably a sea-air, carrying the salt and fish and general smell of the sea; specifically the south Atlantic, and the website [1] shows a swirl at 10kft that could indeed have lofted me a sea-breeze up from Myrtle Beach where my family used to vacation.<p>I request that HackerNews build me an app that will display where the air mass over my current location originated. Take this [1], and run it backward.<p>Can it be done?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earth.nullschool.net&#x2F;",
