What have you been curious about and thought, &quot;I wonder what would happen if you ran a study on this...&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a couple examples:<p>- What numbers are people least&#x2F;most likely to notice missing in an ordered list of numbers? E.g. If you ask people to quickly scan the list [60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69], which element when taken out would have the highest&#x2F;lowest % of people who respond that there are no missing elements? Is it numbers that end in 7? Maybe people always notice when numbers with repeated digits are missed (66).<p>-",

      "text": "I currently work at a FAANG. The money is great, but the job is boring. I am interested in moving to a startup to broaden my responsibilities and improve my skills. The difficulty is that all the startups I&#x27;ve interviewed at have given salary ranges which are between 50-70% of my current salary. It is so much lower that I feel odd completely at a loss when they ask my preferred salary range. If I were going to work for another FAANG, I&#x27;d ask for my salary +15%, but that would put me at something like 2x the typical startup salary I&#x27;ve been offered, and coming in so high above their likely offer would feel ridiculous.<p>1. Is taking a lower salary just the cost of working at a startup as compared with a FAANG?<p>2. Is it stupid to decrease your salary by that much when changing jobs, or is this something that everyone does in exchange for working at a smaller company?<p>3. If I know they can&#x27;t pay me as much as I currently make, but I still want to work at a startup, what should I tell them when they ask me what salary I&#x27;m expecting? My current salary? Something lower?",
