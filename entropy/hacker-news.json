If yes, then are there further steps that would still be ok in your opinion?<p>I do realize that nearly all of them disagree with what Russia is doing, but at the same time they do have non-zero (even if minuscule) leverage on their relatives living in Russia. As a Finnish national I feel I am to an extent responsible for what the Finnish government does, so others letting me know they do not approve what Finland is doing would be ok as long as it is done in a non-threatening way.",
