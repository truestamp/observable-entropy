      "text": "For a decade I have been advocating for the government of Los Alamos County in New Mexico to help with county wide broadband.  The coincidence of my renewed effort, the COVID-19 pandemic, and a sympathetic County Council is yielding progress.  At the direction of the County Council, the County staff has a job posting for a Broadband Manager.  (See the posting at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selfservice.losalamosnm.us&#x2F;ess&#x2F;employmentopportunities&#x2F;default.aspx) The staff is posting the opening for a second time because the first time, only one applicant met even the minimum qualifications.<p>My questions for hacker news are:<p>1. Does the posting look realistic?\n2. Does it describe someone who could get a community broadband network built?\n3. How can the County get qualified people to apply?<p>I&#x27;ve been pushing on this issue since 2011.  I went so far as serving on the County Board of Public Utilities and becoming its Chair in 2015.  Finding that the Board had no authority over the issue, I turned to political organizing and set up the website blabnow.blog.  On that site, you can see what I think we need a Broadband Manager to do at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blabnow.blog&#x2F;los-alamos-broadband-manager-position&#x2F;<p>Beyond asking for thoughts on the Broadband Manager position, I would like to read general comments on:<p>4. How to get local governments to take responsibility for modern communication utility monopolies?",
