      "text": "HN is filled with people from different walks of life who have done various stuff, so thought of asking here :)<p>To give you a background, I am a second year CS student and I am thinking of starting a community (probably in discord) for catering to people who are interested in open source and hackathons (and development in general). I have seen too many people in engineering getting intimidated by development in first year and hence they only work on their leetcoding skills (and poor projects down the line). So the aim is to have a community that welcomes newcomers to the hackathon space and also open source space.<p>How would you have started? And if you have experience in building communities that are non-technical, you can still chime in, it would be amazing to listen to you.<p>Also can any kind of service be built around this community?",
