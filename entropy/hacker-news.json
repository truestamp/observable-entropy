      "text": "Reflecting on my skills as a full stack web developer (senior; in a management position now), I can&#x27;t help but feel that with all the bootcamps, accelerated courses, all this new talent entering the field, that at some point the market will become saturated and I&#x27;ll be less valuable especially as a developer.<p>Now I&#x27;m hearing more and more about Web3 and decentralized apps (DApps) all the time and think about when the internet was new, the average layperson had no idea what a &quot;website&quot; was or a &quot;dot com&quot; meant. Yet now it&#x27;s common knowledge. Is it possible that decentralized apps and blockchain technology is going follow a similar course? And when &quot;classical&quot; web development becomes saturated, these will continue being the highly valued specialist markets?<p>I guess what I&#x27;m asking is, do you feel it is wise and valuable in the long term to begin pivoting one&#x27;s career to blockchain now rather than staying as a typical web dev?",
