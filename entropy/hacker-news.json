      "text": "I run a website for hobbyists that is growing quickly and getting more and more complex. Naturally, people on the Discord server are starting to ask the same questions. It seems like a set of support articles with a good search would help out the community.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a super simple solution which doesn&#x27;t require coding or much setup (open source would be nice, too). I have used Intercom&#x27;s Help Center product in the past, but it just feels too bulky and also a bit pricey.<p>Any recommendations?",
