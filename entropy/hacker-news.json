      "text": "Problem: Interviews are laborious - they take significant prep (which has to be done on my own time inside a busy life), involve a day off work (at least, per company), and are significantly stressful experiences for me. I&#x27;ll accept that.<p>I don&#x27;t have many shots in me to shoot before I burn out from the process, and I want to work on problems that are interesting with people that are interesting as well for respectable salary. \nIt feels unprofessional to quit after 6 months when I realize the work is mostly duct taping prod systems with people who&#x27;s company I don&#x27;t enjoy. \nI&#x27;m 1.5 years into &quot;trying it out&quot; at my current place, and feel unwilling to do this again without better information going in.<p>But companies will give me NONE of this information prior to giving me an offer!<p>- One startup wouldn&#x27;t share even the slightest hint of their pay ranges for someone at my level.\n- Another I asked if I could have a coffee meeting to see if it was a fit - recruiter immediately declined.\n- Spoke to multiple FANGetc. companies, and they don&#x27;t team match until offer time. Some don&#x27;t even do that until you&#x27;ve gone through their &quot;bootcamp&quot;!<p>I don&#x27;t want to work at these places for the brand name (I&#x27;ve got my stripes). I&#x27;m after the people and the problems. But I can&#x27;t get even a hint about either of these things without accepting the job and doing it first.<p>--&gt; It seems like a broken process, like I have to marry someone before meeting them.<p>I&#x27;m around the senior band and have somewhat of a niche in database storage engines and distributed storage platforms. Willing to switch it up to a degree.",

      "text": "Just curious about this one. It seems most of the time what people are doing with Atlassian is also accomplished through the Wiki site structure which, to my knowledge is quite easy to replicate. I’m just curious why there’s such a weird asymmetry between how often open-source tools are used vs. how often we deploy small sites for ourselves using open source.<p>I personally don’t feel Atlassian does anything truly special that isn’t accomplished with some simple things like one does with wiki.<p>I’d absolutely love to hear a dissenting opinion to this!!!",
