      "text": "I am in a dilemma where my tech skills are bit outdated.<p>I have been working as a frontend dev for the past 5 years but unfortunately i don&#x27;t have much experience in the latest frontend framework mainly React JS and every new job requires proficiency in React.<p>In my current job the product i am working on is based on plain JavaScript with jquery so i don&#x27;t get a chance to learn react on the job and have to find time outside working hours to practice and build some projects in react. It is becoming increasingly hard for me to spend all my time on working and learning and it seems like i am on the verge of a burnout.<p>I need some guidance here, espacially from people who are&#x2F;were in similar position and how do they get out of it?",
