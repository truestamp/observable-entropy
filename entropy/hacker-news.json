Burnt out?<p>A reminder you hold <i>so many cards</i> Your org needs you more than you need the org. There are so many software eng opportunities right now, and even with a bear market, you have enough options for employment that your company should be working hard to retain you.<p>Take care of yourself: you work for YouInc, not your company. You and your satisfaction&#x2F;sanity are the product. Your employer is just a customer. Don’t get gaslit into believing in the cult around a specific company, no matter how grand.<p>You can do it. You can interview and get good at selling yourself. Don’t sell yourself short. I believe in you :)<p>Focus on building YouInc - your brand and “product” and you can go far!",
