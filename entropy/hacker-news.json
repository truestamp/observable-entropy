      "text": "Today was the last straw, Apple Music would not allow me to search for a song in my own library, &quot;helping&quot; me to subscribe to Apple Music subscription to listen to a song that is physically already on my computer for a &quot;superior listening experience&quot;<p>Over the years Apple Music (RIP iTunes) has gone from a critical piece of beloved software to a complete mess. Search now actively drives you to Apple Music subscription, old playlists won&#x27;t sync to my phone, my library that used to be a carefully maintained list of songs I love has become a mess with incorrect album art, album names and collections.<p>Is there something that gives us what iTunes was 8-9 years ago that I can export my data and go to? I&#x27;ll even re-rip the hundreds of CDs I have if it means I can properly get back in control of my music listening experience and sync both between my desktop and phone?",
