      "text": "Hi HN,<p>Been looking to create a quick web app sometime in the new year and have been seeing recent posts on HN about Ruby on Rails (now that 7 has released) and Django 4 as well. I&#x27;ve also seen similar praise for Phoenix as well.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen the same love for micro web frameworks like Flask, Sinatra etc, but always seen the above 3 as bloated but not quite sure.<p>So as the title suggests, are micro web frameworks still a good fit? What are your thoughts on this and how is the ecosystem around this?<p>Bonus if you are using them.",
