      "text": "Hacker news is filled with political posts. These types of posts include posts on Government regulation, legal, politics, international politics, party politics, European politics, US&#x2F;China relations etc. Its well within our right and within the HN policy. However I wonder if we should change that policy?<p>I find the community is unwelcoming to ideas other than establishment Democratic Party views, and that makes discussion particularity boring, nonconstructive, and tends toward flame war type discussion. Users that express the wrong opinion, are  met with downvotes and this feels very unnecessary.<p>I propose either 1) ban political posts (we did this after the 2016 election for 1 week or 2) create a politics tab, whose posts are not featured, allowing users to flag posts as politics.<p>What do you think?",
