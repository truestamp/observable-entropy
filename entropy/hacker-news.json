      "text": "How do you build auth for your SaaS apps?<p>Do you use a library like NextAuth? Do you use a provider like Auth0 or Supabase Auth? Do you build your own auth?<p>I&#x27;m building an app using Next.js and Prisma. I&#x27;m currently considering Supabase Auth, Auth0, or writing the auth myself. People keep telling me that writing auth myself is a bad idea, and creating truly secure auth is really hard. Although I tried implementing auth with Supabase Auth, and I tried writing my own auth with Google OAuth and Magic Links, and my own auth ended up feeling much nicer and simpler.<p>I&#x27;m looking for some advice from more experienced people. What do you use? What would you recommend? What are the pros and cons of various approaches?",
