      "text": "&lt;TL-DR&gt;\nI&#x27;ve created a prototype of a system serving the same purpose as email discussions, but working in a more structured and (hopefully) intuitive way.<p>A quick video demonstrating how it works: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5JgeAjwyJok<p>Do you think something like this can be useful? It does solve a problem for me (more details about my motivation below). But I&#x27;m curious if anyone else finds it helpful, so I don&#x27;t end up trying to solve a problem that only exists for me.\n&lt;&#x2F;TL-DR&gt;<p>At company where I work we use a chat-based tool for quick real-time discussions, but use email threads for more complex discussions on a specific topic involving multiple people. For example, coming up with a release plan, figuring out how to handle an issue etc.<p>Although in general our email communication does the job pretty well, there are a few issues with it that I find annoying:\n- 2 people do &quot;reply all&quot; at the same time, &quot;crossing&quot; messages - last one wins and the other person&#x27;s reply is not included on future replies unless someone manually &quot;merges&quot; the 2 replies later.\n- Some people intentionally &quot;reply all&quot;, but not to the latest message in the thread.\n- &quot;Inline replies&quot; are done as a hack by manually adding replies to original message text in message history.\n- Fixing typos and making other corrections requires a new message to be sent to everyone.<p>Sometimes, the result of these issues is a thread with multiple &quot;forks&quot; that are hard to follow and understand. In some cases, important information can even get missed, leading to other issues.<p>So I wanted to come up with a tool that would natively support things like inline&#x2F;non-latest message replies and editing existing messages. I have a working prototype as shown in the video, but wanted to get a feel of what others think about its value before committing to doing more work on this.",
