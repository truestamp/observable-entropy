      "text": "Most of you have already for sure heard of Mozilla’s latest public relation disaster… How they treated the Bitcoin community regarding blacklisting “Proof of Work (PoW)” – which is in reality energy saving and not more energy consuming.<p>The issue with Mozilla is that that so-called FOSS developer sadly has since a long time already an unfortunate and sad history of betraying their own users on a regular base.<p>They did so with their old power user demography when version 29 and later 57 came out with taking away the customization features this user base loved so much with the goal to attract the Chrome user base which are not going to use Mozilla Firefox as there is already a perfect Chrome around and that different target user base sees no reason to use a cheap browser copy, now they do so with the Bitcoin community too and treating them the same way in the form of appealing and aligning with uninformed green deal scam supporting political and activist Progressive movements.<p>It is time to accept sadly that Mozilla turned into a sell-out company and only cares for political agenda these days, unlike in early years where they cared about being different, being unique and being morally superior. Now they tossed all that over board and crossed the moral horizon.<p>Its time to blacklist Firefox the same way they did with POW – Its only fair, and its our moral duty to stop such a morally corrupted browser organization, they do no longer earn the privilege to call themselves FOSS – FOSS is of value and vital, Mozilla is not.<p>Everyone who supports Freedom should uninstall Firefox and get something like Ungoogled Chromium, Brave, Vivaldi, Seamonkey or even something like Edge or Pale Moon…. everything is at this point more honest and more better as compared to Mozilla Firefox.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foundation.mozilla.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reporting-back-on-mozillas-cryptocurrency-donation-policy&#x2F;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;mozilla&#x2F;status&#x2F;1512106765177008130",
