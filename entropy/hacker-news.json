      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I would like to invest in a bootstraped startup as a friends &amp; family investor. I am looking to make a one time total investment &lt;=50K.<p>In the past, I have been involved in early stage startups and paid a high price for  legal advice, and would like to avoid costs &amp; complexity. I would like to have a easy and low cost investment for both parties. I don&#x27;t want to negotiate equity, and would like to defer to terms to later rounds. Based on my understating, this means a SAFE is a good option. Optimally, I would like to invest with my Roth IRA funds.<p>I have ~750k assets in stock and cash<p>My questions are:<p>1) Are there simple contract services to facilitate investments?<p>2) Ideally, I would like to invest from a self directed roth IRA, are there any contract services that support this?",
