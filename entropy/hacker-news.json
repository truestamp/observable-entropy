Plus Apple has a ton of cash on hand that they don&#x27;t seem to be leveraging so &#x27;buying the dip&#x27; right now might be a worthwhile strategy.",

      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a side project and think that I may have come across a really good idea for a product. I estimate that with ~8 months of full-time work I could release it for initial users. Unfortunately, I am not financially stable enough to afford to go that long without income.<p>I know that this is traditionally where startups turn to FF&amp;F for seed funding in exchange for equity. However, I am uninterested in the hyper-growth that the VC money raising cycle requires.<p>I&#x27;ve heard quite a bit about revenue share investing (e.g. 5X a $50k raise paid from 20% of profits over 48 months) and was wondering if anyone has experience with this particular investing vehicle for the FF&amp;F seed money round. It seems like a good balance between not having enough for a traditional bank loan and being uninterested in selling equity. Any literature&#x2F;links would be greatly appreciated as I&#x27;m having trouble sourcing any for this particular topic.<p>Thank you for your time!",
