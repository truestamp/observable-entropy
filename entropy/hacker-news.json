      "text": "Full credit to Fraser Hemphill who built covidqueue.com which makes it way easier to find COVID vaccination appointments than anything the government of Australia has built.<p>The site: covidqueue.com\nVideo on it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gm6oA2bNGdA<p>He built it in a weekend, too.<p>I love how concisely it shows the leverage of technology in the hands of smart folks who want to build useful things for society.<p>There&#x27;s a donate button, but it does make me wonder about incentive alignment. Wouldn&#x27;t it be awesome if there were prizes or grants given out by a foundation of sorts so that there&#x27;s some more incentive for programmers to build these weekend projects.<p>Many do already, of course, because great programmers enjoy the challenge and process.<p>But it mainly made me think about how you could potentially align incentives to increase these leverage points.<p>It made me think this could fall into YC&#x27;s mission.<p>This guy helped me find an appointment one month sooner than I otherwise would. At scale, he&#x27;s likely saving lives, and unlocking a lot more economic benefits if this speeds up vaccination and leads Australia out of lockdown sooner.<p>Also, it&#x27;s an incredible advertisement for school aged children on the power of technology to make the world better.<p>So I&#x27;m curious HN: do you think there&#x27;s a good way to incentivize and reward folks who, in a weekend, can create things that make a massive difference to society? Especially for problems that are unlikely to make sense as a business.",
