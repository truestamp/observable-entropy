      "text": "My idea is a very simple logging SaaS, where you can submit a log by simply make a POST request with your message.  The message can be text or JSON.<p>You will be able to view and search your logs on our website. Everything is managed.<p>That&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t assume anything - the only information we receive is the message you send in the POST request. You can add optional labels, log levels etc.<p>There are a lot of advanced logging services out there, but I have not found something simple like this.<p>I&#x27;ve made a prototype which I use for my own projects. It&#x27;s so much easier compared to logging to disk and using command line tools like grep and awk to search through txt files.<p>Would anyone be interested in using something like this?",
