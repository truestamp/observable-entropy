      "text": "I&#x27;ve always wanted to start my own tech-related business.  If I woke up tomorrow for an idea for SAAS business, I generally know how to bring it to fruition.  I&#x27;ve literally wanted to do this for decades.  My problem is, I can&#x27;t think of something that I can build that someone else would want to pay for.  I&#x27;m not concerned about getting rich.  If I could clear $2000-$5000 a month, that would be great.<p>So, my question is, for <i>those of you who have done it</i>, how did you get an idea for a SAAS kind of thing, or even indie software or some sort of product?",
