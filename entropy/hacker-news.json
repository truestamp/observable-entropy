      "text": "Yesterday, I was talking to my partner, and even though I had heard Alex Hormozi mention that &quot;We&#x27;re all going to die, it doesn&#x27;t matter who we are&quot;, I had never had the &quot;click&quot; that I needed to have to feel it.<p>We&#x27;re all going to die one day, and we don&#x27;t know when that day will be.\nI&#x27;ve spent my whole life trying to find my purpose, where I was simply disappointed most of the time, and I was always looking at other people and comparing myself.<p>But now, I can finally say that I am slowly feeling like I am finding it with more clarity.<p>For that reason, as scary as it might be, I decided that I needed to stop being scared of things that weren&#x27;t going to help me achieve the goals that I have set for myself.<p>The one is to make sure that I always focus on doing something that I love.<p>The second one is to enjoy the process and the journey that comes with doing what I love.<p>Basically, I want to grow old doing what I love, not feeling that I am working.<p>More specially what that means is: building solutions that solve problems (help people) and improve how things are being done (innovate).<p>What&#x27;s that one thing for you?",
