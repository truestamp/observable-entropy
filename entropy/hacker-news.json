And after getting over the shock of the message I immediately thought: &quot;This film couldn&#x27;t have been made for a theatrical release, only a streamer like Netflix could have published this, because of the ending.&quot; The ending would not have &quot;focus grouped&quot; well and the movie would have tanked. But streaming changes that calculus and I am happy for that.<p>On the whole, the film is great, just as a film goes: the acting, the dialog, the delivery, the editing, all of it great.",
