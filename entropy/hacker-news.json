      "text": "I asked a question today(19th Oct 2021)[0] about the laptop spec required for XR development. Yesterday I asked a similar question and also provided my budget for the laptop[1]. The only reply to that question was a single word &quot;None&quot; :)\nWhenever I shop around for development systems and or test devices I look for the lowest common denominator spec. This helps me develop within constraints and hence reach users who may not be able to afford high-spec devices or platforms. It is always easy to go from low-spec targets to high-spec targets. But the other way round is not easy.<p>Today I saw a post by another member of this community also asking for help on spec for development system(an Apple device)[2]. The poster will be using the system for web, mobile and ML development. Looking at the spec that is listed in that post, I thought to myself, &quot;Am I the outlier who always looks for low-spec systems both for development and test systems?&quot;<p>How do you all decide on what spec your development and test platforms should have? Do you always go for high spec devices and platforms?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28916747\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28903262\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28921836",
