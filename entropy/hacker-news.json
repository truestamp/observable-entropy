      "text": "Hi there, I&#x27;m a software engineer working @ FAANG, I&#x27;ve been here a year, looking to switch teams to somewhere with less legacy systems.<p>I&#x27;ve met with several teams, but one in particular stood out, since the manager was saying they are a distributed team, some people are in the bay while some are based in brazil.<p>This is the only team I think I will find that supports fully remote work, it would be a huge relief to not have to move to an expensive cost of living area like the bay or seattle, but at the same time being fully remote I would possibly, not be able to build the same relationships as I would have in person.<p>Do you think not being in office will hurt my future career in a significant way as a junior engineer? I have nothing to compare it to since I joined during the pandemic, I feel like I have been productive in my single year tenure and enjoy not having to sit in traffic every day.",
