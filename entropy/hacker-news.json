      "text": "There are so many web frameworks &#x2F; stacks these days. Honestly, when I look at many of them, they don&#x27;t appear to have a good list of libraries and ecosystem &#x2F; maturity.<p>I am not very familar with modern nodejs &#x2F; SPA type of web development. I am looking for one of reasonably modern &quot;batteries included&quot; web stacks which strike balance between productivity (reasonably fast to prototype, not leading to unmaintainable magic code) and performance (not very resource hungry, reasonably good at vertical scaling, which I suppose rules out many python&#x2F;ruby based stacks).<p>My preferences:\n    * Good component libraries.<p><pre><code>    * reasonably good on front end performance.\n\n    * Preferably in typed language.\n\n    * On back-end side, easy libraries or built in facilities for common tasks such as authentication.\n</code></pre>\nI have looked at a few. On front end, svelte seems very good in concept, but I&#x27;m afraid ecosystem is small and still developing. Angular is not apparently preferred much. On backend, I have read about some Java (Play, spring) and nodejs based frameworks. But before diving into one, I&#x27;d like to ask a few experienced people here, as the shortcomings don&#x27;t become apparent until you&#x27;ve worked in it.",
