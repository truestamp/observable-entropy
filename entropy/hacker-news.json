      "text": "The road on which our house in rural France sits finally got a name two years ago.<p>But still no-one can find us because Google Maps hasn&#x27;t added it. UPS delivers parcels to an access point 10km away, and doesn&#x27;t tell us. Other couriers leave our parcels randomly at a similarly named street hundreds of yards away.<p>I&#x27;ve submitted the name through the Android app multiple times, including attaching a geotagged photo of the street sign, but no dice. My addition of the name for an adjacent street that was also missing was accepted within 24 hours, first attempt.<p>I&#x27;ve submitted the new name to OpenStreetMap successfully. Is there anything else I can do? And why are they incapable of correctly evaluating contributions that match up with the official cadastral map?",
