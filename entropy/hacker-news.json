      "text": "Hey folks, I&#x27;ve been working a travel matching and dating app for the last 3 years. We have over 5M+ data points on users and match events. Data include: city (based on IP), current country, desired travel locations, search preferences, matches, gender, age, personality type (based on MBTI), ethnicity, mobility (not remote, semi, fully remote), languages, nationality, and photos of faces.<p>If you&#x27;d like to use the data anonymously for any research topics, please get in touch with me. We&#x27;re sitting on a lot of data that could be really interesting. I find data scientists super inquisitive and brilliant, so just wanted to offer this opportunity to collaborate.",

      "text": "I made a post about differences between streaming versions of The Matrix [1], and shortly afterward I started getting a lot of Google search traffic (tens of thousands of visitors in the past 24 hours).<p>It looks like this is because my post is the #2 result when you search &quot;the matrix hulu&quot; and similar variations on Google. I didn&#x27;t intend for this to happen.<p>I&#x27;ve added a box at the top of the post that tells people that The Matrix isn&#x27;t on Hulu anymore and what their other options are.<p>I see two paths forward:<p>1) Try to drop in search rankings because it seems like people are getting to the post from somewhat unrelated searches. I think I could do this by changing the name of the post.<p>2) Leave the post as-is even though I didn&#x27;t intend for this to happen because the other search results are filled with ads and no information at all. At least my post actually tells people they can&#x27;t watch on Hulu.<p>What do you think the right move is? Is there something else I haven&#x27;t considered?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.echevarria.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-matrix-looks-different-hulu-hbo-max&#x2F;index.html",
