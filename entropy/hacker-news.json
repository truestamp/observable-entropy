If it becomes successful, I want to give the people who made the FOSS projects it depends on a proper reward.<p>That made me think. Let&#x27;s take an unrealistic, extreme scenario:<p>My app turns me into a Jeff Bezos with a conscience. One of the dependencies for my app is made by a single developer. I give them a million dollars. That would probably change their life so much that it may even hurt the project, right? What if they decide to travel the world, and forget about the project?<p>So my question to you: what would be a good reward, both for the creator and their project?",
