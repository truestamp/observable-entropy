      "text": "Been looking for advice on which type of IRA to chose from, as I don&#x27;t have access to a 401k.<p>Most advice is &#x27;if you will be in the same or lower tax bracket during retirement, chose Traditional, otherwise Roth.<p>Which sort of sounds like &#x27;if you can predict the future, choose x&#x27;<p>But did more research and it seems like everyone should chose Roth IRA. 4 reasons why.<p>1. Unless you’re an extremely disciplined saver and calculate how much money you saved on taxes with a Traditional IRA and invest that in a different account, you will , end up with more after tax money in retirement with a Roth IRA.<p>2. If you continue to increase your income, eventually you won&#x27;t be able to invest in a Roth. If you are single making over $140,000, you can&#x27;t invest.<p>3. Early withdrawal rules are much more flexible with a Roth. There are ways you can get out your contributions before 59 years old without paying a penalty.<p>4. The Roth accounts have fewer restrictions for retired people. Traditional IRAs accounts require you to start taking money out at 72. With a Roth you don&#x27;t have to.",
