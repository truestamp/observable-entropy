      "text": "Hi - This sounds like sci-fi brain storming, but I am actually asking a serious question.<p>I often think that the key to weight-loss in 21st century could be some kind of way to convert energy stored in our body to electricity. Maybe you can plug in your laptop to your body, or have a chip inside your body to mine Bitcoin or whatever. After some research, I assume the generated energy would not be that much but the goal here is to find a way to burn [use&#x2F;waste] the extra energy so that you can lose weight.<p>Any input on this would be appreciated.",
