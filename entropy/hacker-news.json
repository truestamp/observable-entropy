      "text": "Hi all,<p>Sebastian and his students did a tremendous job creating Brackit[1] in the first place as a retargetable query engine for different data stores. They worked hard to optimize aggregations and joins. Despite its clear database query engine routes, it&#x27;s furthermore useable as a standalone ad-hoc in-memory query engine.<p>Sebastian did his research for his Ph.D. at the TU-Kaiserslautern at the database systems group of Theo Härder. Theo Härder coined the well-known acronym ACID with Andreas Reuter, the desired properties of transactions.<p>As he&#x27;s currently not maintaining the project anymore, I stepped up and forked the project a couple of years ago. I&#x27;m using it for my evolutionary, immutable data store SirixDB[2], which stores the entire history of your JSON data in small-sized snapshots in an append-only file (tailored binary format similar to BSON). It&#x27;s exceptionally well suited for audits, undo operations, and sophisticated analytical time travel queries.<p>I&#x27;ve changed a lot of stuff, such that Brackit is getting more and more compatible with the JSONiq query language standard, added JSONiq update primitives, and fixed several bugs. Furthermore, I&#x27;ve added temporal extension functions and temporal XPath axis in SirixDB, index rewrite rules, etc. pp.<p>As Brackit can query XML, we&#x27;re also able to transform XML data to JSON and vice versa.<p>Moshe and I are working on a  Jupyter Notebook &#x2F; Tutorial[3] for interactive queries.<p>We&#x27;re looking forward to your bug reports, issues, and questions. Contributions are, of course, highly welcome. Maybe even implementations for other data stores or common query optimizations.<p>Furthermore, we&#x27;d gladly see further (university-based?) research.<p>It should, for instance, be possible to add vector instructions in the future, as the query engine is already set-oriented and processes sets of tuples for the so-called FLWOR expressions (see JSONiq). Brackit rewrites FLWOR expression trees in the AST to a pipeline of operations to port optimizations from relational query engines for efficient join processing and aggregate expressions. Furthermore, certain parts of the queries are parallelizable, as detailed in Sebastian&#x27;s thesis. We also envision a stage for the compiler to use distributed processing (first research used MapReduce, but we can now use better-suited approaches, of course).<p>Kind regards\nJohannes<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sirixdb&#x2F;brackit\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sirix.io | https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sirixdb&#x2F;sirix\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;19eC-UfJVm_gCjY--koOWN50sgiFa5hSC",
