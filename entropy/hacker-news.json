      "text": "Can anybody with a company registered in France share their experience delivering source code to their French clients in the public sector?<p>Under Loi Toubon, is it illegal for comments and variable names to be English only? Or is it sufficient when user manual and user interface is delivered in French?<p>In other words, do comments in source code represent documentation as understood by the Loi Toubon and thus need to be delivered in French?<p>Is the law in this regard applied differently when dealing with the private sector?<p>The resources I could find in English do not mention any requirements when it comes to source code. I’m also questioning the practicality of delivering a software project that includes open source packages that in addition to having a suitable license will need to have their readme files translated let alone their comments.",
