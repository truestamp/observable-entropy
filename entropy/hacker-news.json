      "text": "We&#x27;re a couple of software engineers who believe that to build great software you need to write good tests, but we also sympathise when engineers say things like:<p>- &quot;Writing tests was too time consuming on my tight schedule&quot;, or<p>- &quot;Unit tests don&#x27;t catch enough bugs, so they&#x27;re useless&quot;, or<p>- &quot;I&#x27;ve inherited a legacy code base without tests and have no idea where to start&quot;<p>To tackle this we&#x27;re building Symbolica (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.symbolica.dev), a symbolic code executor [1], that lets you run your code for all possible inputs. This means you can do things like:<p>- Assert properties about your code and check that they hold for every conceivable input.<p>- Check that two implementations of the same function&#x2F;method&#x2F;program are equivalent, which is really useful if you&#x27;re refactoring a legacy codebase without tests.<p>- Find out if your code will hit any undefined behaviours, e.g. divide by zero or out of bounds array access.<p>We&#x27;re still really early in the development of this product, but we&#x27;re excited to have built a working prototype of the symbolic executor for C programs. We wanted to get some feedback from potential early adopters so we&#x27;ve put up a code playground (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.symbolica.dev&#x2F;playground) where you can try out Symbolica on C programs in the browser for free. We&#x27;d love people to give it a go and give us their thoughts.<p>Our plan is to build this out into a hosted cloud service that you can integrate into your DevOps pipeline (e.g. GitHub actions) so that you can run these powerful tests on every CI build.<p>Further down the line we plan to add support for other languages too. We&#x27;ve currently got proof of concept implementations for Lisp and Python and will be looking into C++, Rust and .NET after. Of course we&#x27;re always willing to prioritise a particular language if there&#x27;s strong demand.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in what we&#x27;re building then please either message us at dev@symbolica.dev or join the alpha waiting list if you want to get first access to our full offering once we launch that.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Symbolic\\_execution",
