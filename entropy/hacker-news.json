      "text": "By nature, I am very well organized and conscientious; it&#x27;s a natural progression that  I work in operations. Often, I feel that part of my job is just babysitting, reminding people to do their job, and constantly reminding them of deliverables, some large and some small but essential. So I and my three reports spend a lot of time reminding people of their deliverables and deadlines. As I said, babysitting.\nThere are two drawbacks:\n1) It&#x27;s stupid, tedious, and a waste of time. Oh yeah, and most of them are executives!\n2) If we get caught in the middle of a s-storms, some things inevitably fall within the cracks.<p>Today we hack the solution of tracking things via a google sheet, but it&#x27;s tedious, long, and it cannot be partially shared with the interested parties.<p>Is there a SaaS where I can set up a task, add attachments, add links, then share it with an email address; then the receiver gets reminded on a timely basis (selected on an individual case basis) of the die deliverables?\nBest if there&#x27;s a reporting module.<p>TIA",
