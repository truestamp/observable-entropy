      "text": "I understand that low level or systems programming is a very broad concept and it is impossible for a single person to master everything under the sun. However, I am looking for a resource which explains the various aspects of low level or systems programming and hopefully points to some good books or websites on each subject. Even better would be links to online courses or some kind of &quot;syllabus&quot; for each topic. Some topics I would expect such a resource to cover are<p>- CPU, ISAs and assembly languages for different architectures<p>- operating systems<p>- audio programming (DSPs, harmonic analysis, etc.)<p>- graphics programming<p>- compilers and programming language implementation<p>- media codecs (audio, video, images)<p>- media processing (e.g. text to speech or speech recognition)<p>- networking (IP, TCP, etc.)<p>- embedded systems<p>- cryptography (or implementation of cryptocurrencies like Monero)<p>- text rendering (creation of fonts and display on screen)<p>- signal processing (e.g. wireless or satellite signals)<p>- telecom systems (5G, 4G, etc.)<p>- positioning systems (GPS, GLONASS, etc.)<p>- any other topic the community thinks I have missed out",
