      "text": "Hey HN. I&#x27;m new to the Bay Area and here for half a year for an internship at a tech company (currently doing masters in EU). Looking to meet some cool people around here but other than some of the other interns + my housemate its been a little hard getting an intro. Meetups seem to be pretty scarce on meetup.com and the only other events thing I&#x27;ve found is via the bay area&#x2F;SF discord, but that seems to be pretty biased toward SF. Would love to meet some cool people around here (in tech or otherwise) but it seems meetups have died down a little w.r.t threads from a couple years ago. I figured there&#x27;s a good amount of locals here, any good tips? Thanks!",
