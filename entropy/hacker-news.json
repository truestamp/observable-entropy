      "text": "I just got an email from BitDefender (I personally use their antivirus) stating the following (at 10:01 PM tonight), verbatim:<p>&gt; Dear [redacted],<p>&gt; The decision to discontinue a product is never easy.<p>&gt; It’s especially hard with a product as popular as our Free Edition has been in recent years.<p>&gt; Since early 2020, we have had to weather immense changes in our industry; changes that upended many of our cherished plans for product development.<p>&gt; Sadly, Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition has been a casualty of those changes.<p>&gt; As of 1st of January 2022, Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition will officially be discontinued and no longer available for use.<p>&gt; As a Free Edition user, how does this affect you, and how should you prepare?<p>&gt; We will continue to offer tech support for our Free Edition until 30st of June 2022. We hope this gives you time to choose and install an alternative solution that will keep your devices protected.<p>Thought I&#x27;d be a good Samaritan and share the news on here, for anyone who isn&#x27;t subscribed to the newsletter. Good luck in finding a new antivirus!",
