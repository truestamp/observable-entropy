      "text": "Growing up I always enjoyed tech and was excited for all the problems tech can solve and all the improvements it can make and has made in my life. However, recently I had to check-in into a doctors office using a 3rd party software and the process is incredibly worse for the patient. Normally, I walk in, tell them my name and sit down. Now on my phone, I have to enter my DOB, answer a few questions, &quot;Accept&quot; some consent forms every time. They will not see me if I don&#x27;t use the system. Then, at the end I am greeted with an advertisement for a medication.<p>Another one, recently had to call comcast as they were charging my parents $70 for what they are offering for $20, I play the call of &quot;i want to cancel it is too expensive, AT&amp;T cheaper&quot;. They recently &quot;improved&quot; their phone bot and added some &quot;amazing&quot; features. I am saying I want to cancel service&#x2F;speak to customer service, and this thing goes and tells me it is restarting my modem.......then for the next 15 minutes I cannot reach anyone at comcast because my modem is restarting, every time I call I was getting, &quot;We are restarting your modem call us back later GOODBYE!&quot;......I swear things like this just make me want to go live off-grid somewhere.",
