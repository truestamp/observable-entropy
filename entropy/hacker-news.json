      "text": "I find myself lately gravitating back to older communities that survived the social media wave on the Internet because they seem to be a bit better at keeping track and promoting visibility of meaningful conversations, despite traditional functional flaws, screen sizing, and often dreadful large threaded views. I think a major strength is that most of these traditionally designed sites&#x2F;apps still emphasize chronological order for content and posts, which makes the experience less prone to manipulation and more timely.<p>It also seems with older sites like HN and online bulletin boards, content can be bookmarked, and it&#x27;s easier to correspond with users on a more regular basis. I think the most frustrating trend on modern sites and apps is that content I want to see simply disappears into a sea of other things I don&#x27;t want to see, and that searching to find that content is futile, as results are often gamified and spammed into oblivion.<p>I miss IRC now, I miss bulletin boards despite all the flaws, I miss old school web sites that had the same content in the same place even after hitting refresh.<p>In my opinion, traditionally highly effective, favorable, and functional user-experience-based design has been thrown out the window lately as a trend; apps now are very often geared towards tracking, sponsored post placement, and profit&#x2F;revenue optimization goals, rather than towards creating favorable user experiences.<p>It makes me wonder (despite some issues of course) if HN is still one of the best places to communicate and post serious matters BECAUSE it&#x27;s UI&#x2F;UX hasn&#x27;t changed (In major ways) for many years?",
