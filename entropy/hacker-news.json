When I started to be a &quot;conscious&quot; user of the Internet, such services already became centralized, so I don&#x27;t really remember those times. As I follow the development of projects like Matrix, I wonder what has made SMTP such a stable protocol that has stood the test of time and what is the real reason we don&#x27;t use XMPP (I mean, we do using Whatsapp, but as a part of closed ecosystem).<p>Is it only that XMPP was overcomplicated and if managed better it would survive? Or is it something else?",
