A few approaches came up in my research:\n- Buy a PineTab&#x2F;RasPad&#x2F;CutiePi.\n- Buy a Chromebook tablet and install Linux on it.\n- Buy an Android tablet and try to install another Linux distro on it. Ubuntu Touch&#x2F;postmarketOS are some options that came up on my research.\n- Buy a x86 (Intel Atom) device.<p>Is there any other approach that I am not aware of? Which would you guys recommend for a newbie?",
