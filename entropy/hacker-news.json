      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for an application or a software library that will allow me to create a photo gallery with the following features:<p>1. Generate a photo gallery (HTML, PDF, whatever) that is easily sharable. In 2022, this means HTTP, but doesn&#x27;t have to be HTML (a PDF could work well too).<p>2. I must be able to support photos with captions.<p>3. I should be able to view this photo gallery for the next 20 - 50 years without much maintenance (preferably none).<p>4. I need something that makes editing reasonably simple. Basically I should be able to present the application a directory of photos and their associated captions, and it can generate the gallery.<p>The reason to do this is so I can create long-lasting memories with photos.<p>I&#x27;ve evaluated a few options:<p>1. Something like sigal + photoswipe: This might be okay, but the complexity of the JavaScript library does not inspire confidence for long-term durability.<p>2. Physical photo album: ticks almost all the boxes, except it is costly to edit and not easy to share.<p>3. Word&#x2F;libreoffice documents or presentations converted to PDF: I suspect the durability will be good, but the editing is a bit painful (as sizing the photos and pages are a bit difficult).<p>4. LaTeX with beamer: editing is not great, formatting is not great.<p>5. Something custom, perhaps sigal + a very basic HTML theme without JS: I&#x27;ll likely have to perform maintenance over the years.<p>Are there anything else? Is &quot;modern&quot; technology simply not good enough for long-term, durable archives?",
