      "text": "I have a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from a top #3 University in Germany. After my Bachelors I switched to a Masters of Science program in Informatics &#x2F; Computer Science at that same University. I am still in my 1st year of the masters (about 25% of the way through). I have gathered 2-3 years of Software Enginnering experience on the side and consider myself a junior software engineer.<p>I dread the world of academia, I don&#x27;t wanna become a researcher and really just wanna go full time into software enginnering at some reputable company and contribute to some interesting project(s).<p>A bit more about myself: I think I am a decent developer, always eager to learn, and I feel I am very good at selling my skills to companies as I have a rather high application-to-job-offer-ratio so to say. I guess part of it is that I display a lot of confidence in my abilities outwardly.<p>Here is the problem though: I am and want to be a software engineer, but if I drop out now my only degree will be in electrical engineering and NOT computer science. So I fear that I will never be considered a real software engineer based on my academic title.<p>I have swayed back and forth multiple times and am currently kind of half-heartedly still doing my courses and everything.<p>Would it be a good idea to drop out? Again, I frankly hate academic life and love creating stuff NOT for university credits but for an actual purpose. What would people experienced in the field advise me to do?<p>Thanks a lot",
