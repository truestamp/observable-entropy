      "text": "It&#x27;s clear that the level of sophistication in recruitment, screening, and hiring in the tech world has reached new heights in the past decade.  This has left me, and I assume many of us with a lot of absurd hurdles to jump to ever have a chance.  It is, for me, a total black-box: I fail again and again, without any feedback of how to change.  All I can do is try something slightly different the next time, with a new application&#x2F;company, and see if I can tell anything from the changed variables.<p>While the problems with tech bootcamps need not be restated here, as an observer from the outside, I am always attracted to, specifically, the components of them that deal with actually forming a resume, getting recruiters, doing interviews, creating a portfolio, etc.<p>Is there a service that exists which can train people to apply to jobs?  I just want someone human I can talk to, that knows the business, and can give me feedback on a given application, help me understand what I am missing.",
