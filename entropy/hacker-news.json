I was 70% sure that the words &quot;home&quot; and &quot;network&quot; appeared in the post, so I searched in &quot;Stories&quot; in &quot;Past Week&quot; for these keywords and didn&#x27;t find it.<p>I had to switch to &quot;All&quot; and noticed that the search engine didn&#x27;t take the word &quot;networking&quot; into account which appeared in the title. I would argue that stemming and searching for root words is a basic feature of a modern search engine, if I type &quot;site:news.ycombinator.com home network&quot; into Google, I find the article without any problems.<p>So to sum up: What is the intention behind the way the search engine works? If I would type in &quot;home network&quot; in a full-text search engine, even that would give me the correct article but for some reason HN&#x27;s search engine is not capable of that.",
