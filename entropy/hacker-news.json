      "text": "I wanted to include &quot;successful&quot; in the title, but alas, that was too long! I&#x27;m the technical cofounder of a medical device startup that&#x27;s about to enter our first-in-man trials in the USA (Class II de-novo). Learning about regulated industries is difficult for startups, and while I think our team has done a fantastic job of learning the basics (including successfully submitting our Investigation Device Exemption), it has been an incredibly long slog of YouTube lectures, random blog posts, and occasional conferences to build the necessary knowledge to bring this product to market.<p>What groups are you part of, blogs do you read, books can you recommend etc etc that have proven helpful in your journeys?<p>Also feel free to plug what you&#x27;re doing, always interested to hear what projects other people in this space are up to!",
