      "text": "People who are sitting in front of the computer most of the day browsing a lot of tabs, consuming and processing information, maybe even programming or doing any brain-intensive work: are you having changes in your memory? I feel having a little issues. I forget things and not able to think clearly after a long day. Its mild but its there. Even if I open a lot of tabs, I obviously don&#x27;t remember everything word to word but the gist and the central idea. Maybe I&#x27;ve unintentionally trained my brain to process lot of information rather than store it. I don&#x27;t know. But if others are feeling the same, maybe I am not weird.<p>Wondering if anyone going through this or related to this? Sharing would be great.",
