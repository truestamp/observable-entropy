      "text": "Apologies, I&#x27;m sure this has come up many times but I&#x27;ve noticed that a number of sites&#x2F;services (usually which have free tiers) will start their cheapest paid tier at more than $5 a month. Is there any specific logic to this?<p>For example, the monthly fees for:<p>- Reddit Premium - $5.99 \n- Evernote - £5.99 ($7.39)\n- YouTube Premium - £11.99 ($14.80)\n- Experian Credit Check - £14.99 ($18.50)\n- Microsoft (Office) 365 Personal - £5.99 ($7.39)<p>Whether these services are worth the money is not my question - but is it not profitable to offer a e.g. $2 monthly tier (in general, not for these sites in particular)? On Patreon (different I realise) $1&#x2F;$2 supporter tiers do seem more common so there are obviously people who would pay $1 a month for something but wouldn&#x27;t pay $6 a month. Which is what I&#x27;d expect.",
