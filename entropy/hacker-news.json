      "text": "Hi. I’m newbie789 and I just noticed that all of my posts for over a week have been hidden from public view. I haven’t received any warnings from the mods, the only time any post of mine have been flagged they’ve been rightfully vouched for, and I’ve accumulated over 1100 karma points.<p>Is this at the request of a particular poster or group of posters? I have a habit of calling out silly low-effort self-indulgent blog posts (which I find to be a common waste of first page real estate.) Did I offend the Blog Gods? Somehow my posting is so offensive as to deserve being hidden from the average users but not so offensive that it gets downvoted?",
