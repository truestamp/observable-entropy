All of them have a similar generic landscape background, a random quote from Goodreads, and except for these tweets aimed at my friend&#x27;s company, they only have a few rewteets.\nI&#x27;ve tried helping him by using Twitter&#x27;s report feature and even their contact us feature with a hand written message, but of course, nothing has come from this.\nWe&#x27;re not sure what the attacker&#x27;s end game is, but it&#x27;s placing a lot of stress on my friend and he&#x27;s not sure what&#x27;s next.<p>Is there anything else we can try? These are obvious bots that are spewing misinformation, but Twitter doesn&#x27;t seem to care.",
