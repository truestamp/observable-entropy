      "text": "My background is electronics and IT support. Day to day I keep a big financial company running. I have 12 years of experience in this field, but my professional goal has always been to be a developer.<p>I haven&#x27;t needed a degree so far, but I have re-enrolled in school to get a software engineering degree. At this rate, working full time, I might graduate by 2025... that&#x27;s too far in the future.<p>I&#x27;ve been sharpening my skills and I&#x27;ve started applying to jobs recently. I still think my resume and portfolio don&#x27;t really sound appealing to a hiring manager, so I want to improve that.<p>I am working solo on a personal project that should be of significant impact in the biotech community and might land me a paper once finished, but it&#x27;s also taking me a considerable amount of time to complete. It&#x27;s nothing too fancy from an algorithm standpoint, I&#x27;m not breaking ground, the value is in it&#x27;s functionality, not the tech stack.<p>What can I work on to put in my github to demonstrate that I am ready to devote myself to the change and that I deserve a chance? I really want to do this, but I think I need better material to sell myself.<p>Any help is appreciated, and if anyone wants an apprentice, I will gladly work ad honorem after hours or on weekends.",
