      "text": "I’m a DevOps consultant. I make good money building infrastructure for businesses. I find the work interesting (even fun sometimes) but I’ve been doing this for a long time. And all the jobs I’ve had before consulting were in B2B. I’ve helped cigarette companies, soda companies, insurance companies, and even governments. I’m starting to worry about my impact on the world. What did I accomplish in helping these companies? How do I apply a DevOps skill set in a way that helps humanity? What should I do if I’m unmotivated by money and more interesting in helping move the world towards a certain ideal? Should I just drop out of tech and do something else with my life? Has tech been lost to the capitalist machines?",

As the title says, I made a [financial data  web app](www.trackerelite.io) that empowers the next generation of investors.<p>For example, We democratize intangible asset data via our web interface. You can access our data on B2B Rights, Brand, Relationships etc that can be protected by Intellectual Property and that drives stake holder Value.<p>I started working on this a few years ago, with the idea that Intangible Assets are the next generation of stock market data. Our platform which is in beta, solves many issues for us and for other people investing in today’s culture. It’s personally has helped drive my portfolio up 700% in the past 3.5 years.<p>I am curious to hear any feedback on the idea but also what we can implement to make the app more useful.<p>Link to the landing page (www.trackerelite.io)<p><i>Subscribe on our site for updates and potential early access to our beta  </i><p>!!!!!ALSO PLEASE UPVOTE THIS SO OTHERS CAN SEE THIS INFORMATION!!!!!!!",
