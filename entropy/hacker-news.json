      "text": "From time to time I have ideas pop up that&#x27;d I&#x27;d like to rapidly prototype and get in front of potential users quickly but that will have to be re designed or torn down just as fast. I had thought that even as a pretty experienced developer at this point, learning a no code solution may be just the trick for this.<p>That said, learning a new tool always has added complexities of itself and in a lot of cases if the prototypes wind up being useful I&#x27;d just have to write it again in something like React or Svelte.<p>I spent a few hours using Bubble today and my gut was telling me it would just be better to find a visual editor for React like utopia.app but maybe more mature. I&#x27;m not sure without using Bubble for a lot longer and investing time into learning their idiosyncrasies that I would be able to effectively judge any real speed ups to producing my initial prototypes and I&#x27;m not sold on making that investment at this moment.<p>Where do other developers here land on this? What are your prototyping gotos, especially for React apps?",
