      "text": "For years you have been able to buy a USB-A hub with lots of ports that provide data &amp; power. For some reason though its impossible to find anything like that for USB-C. I was looking for a hub that has 4 USB-A ports &amp; 4 USB-C ports with data &amp; power for all and I cant find anything at all. The most I could find is 2 &amp; 2, and usually with a bunch of other unnecessary ports.<p>This made me think: is there some technical limitations here? I feel like the demand should be there since it was there for USB-A, and USB-C has already been out and popularized for many years. The only reason I can think why such a product doesn&#x27;t exist _at all_ is because of some technical limitation like power draw or something.",
