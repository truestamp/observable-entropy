What, if anything, have they <i>conclusively</i> proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt? Why is it so apparently incredibly difficult to prove whether Mars has&#x2F;has had water or not?<p>In case it&#x27;s not obvious, I know <i>nothing</i> about astronomy, physics, geology, biology etc, so please don&#x27;t be snarky. I just genuinely don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s so difficult.",
