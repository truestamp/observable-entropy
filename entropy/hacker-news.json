      "text": "Recently, I&#x27;ve stepped out of the shadow of being a W2 employee into being a one-man entrepreneur like Pieter Levels. He runs super popular remotelist and remoteok.<p>At first I thought he just made a great product and that was it, but at closer inspection, I&#x27;m having doubts.<p>1. Earlier today, a reddit thread on the digitalnomad subreddit completely bashed nomadlist. Hundreds of upvotes saying nomadlist wasn&#x27;t worth it, with dozens of comments agreeing. Only one person raised defense for it.<p>2. When looking at the nomadlist product itself, it&#x27;s kind of ...rough. Not that I care about that sort of thing, but it&#x27;s riddled with bugs, design flaws, etc.<p>3. He publishes his refund rate, which is just above 10%. This seems really high.<p>Is this a case to where he got lucky and owned the digital nomand &#x2F; remote work market early enough that the product actually doesn&#x27;t matter? Or am I missing something?",
