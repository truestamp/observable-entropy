      "text": "I’d like to say I’m a vscode power user - I use a huge amount of shortcuts, keystrokes, etc. To the point where when peers watch me code I get comments on my proficiency with the IDE. Time and time again, though, I’ll stumble across YouTube videos or some form of media explaining that vsc skill ceiling is far lower than vim&#x2F;eMacs.<p>I don’t have a problem with anything on vsc - in fact, I use it when I ssh into servers because I like the nice “at a glance” file UI, and I don’t have to cd &amp; ls to see where and what everything is.<p>Unlearning all the vsc keystrokes, shortcuts, and tools is going to be a serious time commitment, but I’m a young guy and have a long career ahead of me. If vim is really that much faster, I’d be willing to take the performance hit for long term growth.",
