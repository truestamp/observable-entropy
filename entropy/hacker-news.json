      "text": "Greetings!<p>I&#x27;ve just created a service that launches a Localstack container, make it available at a personalized URL, and then shuts it down within 10 to 60 minutes.<p>I made this because Localstack is a great way to mock the AWS cloud for Local Development or in CI&#x2F;CD. But, to run it, you need a Laptop with enough available memory, Docker, Python, and other CLIs.<p>Also, if you want to develop locally with an AWS account, you&#x27;ll have to sign up for an account. But then, resources get created and never deleted potentially leading to an expensive bill.<p>Feel free to give it a try and let me know what you think!",
