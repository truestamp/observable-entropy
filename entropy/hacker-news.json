But im trying to find maps &#x2F; sites that could help to find the safest route. There is almost a straight line west. But I have no live info if this is safe.  Google maps shows a southern route via Odessa etc, but that obviously doesnt take into account any of the developments. (The people helping don&#x27;t speak the language)",
