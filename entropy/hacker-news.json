      "text": "Hello folks, recently I&#x27;ve updated my kotlinx.serialization plugin which focuses on TOML, a configuration file format. I&#x27;d like to post it on HN for more feedbacks. :)<p>This library works much like the official JSON format, where you use Toml as entrypoint, Toml.encodeToString to encode almost any data structures (if is custom class then @Serializable is needed for sure) into TOML-file-like strings, and decodeFromString to reverse the process. In addition, Toml.parseToTomlTable allows you to just parse the TOML-file-like strings into TomlTable, which behaves like JsonObject from the official JSON as well. Then you could access each entry by key like myConfig[&quot;version&quot;]. For more information, check out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Peanuuutz&#x2F;tomlkt.",
