      "text": "We are a for-purpose Melbourne based start-up KeepActive.com.au, that allows people to connect with locals and create or join physical activity groups (such as hiking , walking , running or sports) for free. Loneliness is a big issue in society and we are hoping by providing this free service we can help more people connect.<p>Meetup.com is one of our competitors but they charge $24 USD per month which can be significant deterrent for someone wanting to create a local recreational group.<p>Two of the revenue models we are considering:\n1. Sponsorship - A lot of organisations such as health fund providers, sports good stores, governments share our goal of supporting community mental and physical health. We hope to get sponsorship from these organisations<p>2. Corporate Programs - Build a corporate program allowing company employees to create private spaces where employees can connect with other employees. This will supports employees menatl and physical health. Also, it will encourage employees to connect with others from across the organisation building friendships and empathy for each other.<p>Open to feedback and suggestions.",
