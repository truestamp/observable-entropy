And they do it quickly too. Now management prefers to hear only from them, even if somebody else was working hard on the project in place.<p>I think writing, like painting to some and even programming to others, doesn&#x27;t come naturally to me. I spent a lot of time formulating this passage.<p>I want to become better at writing. I want to learn how to write well like back when I did with programming. The difference is I didn&#x27;t find writing manuals or textbooks that practically point me to the right direction.<p>How do I learn proper writing?",
