      "text": "My wife (staying at home) and I have a 2yo girl and a 7mo girl and raise them trilingually (English, Spanish, German).\nTo our surprise, the 2yo has a better pronunciation than monolingual peers.\nShe also has a remarkable memory and can remember names of places and people.\nMoreover, she discovers letters on signs and posters. Her favorite book is a visual dictionary. [3]\nIn general, our daughters can have access to all tools after a short introduction and under supervision.\nScissors? Hold em like this. Kitchen knife? Handle with care. China plates? Careful.<p>Most people in our neighborhood do not have a strategy on how to raise the children.\nThey rather trust in day care to take care of that or follow their intuition.<p>I feel a strong need to strategically work out an education.\nSo far, I have been studying the Montessori work, namely &#x27;Montessori, the Science Behind the Genius&#x27; [2].<p>I am interested in the following questions:\n1. What educational strategy &#x2F; syllabus do you have for your children?\n2. At what age do you introduce smartphones &#x2F; tablets for their independent usage? (<i>)\n   1. What do you think of the WHO guidance [4]?\n   2. How much screen time do you think is beneficial &#x2F; detrimental?\n3. How do you provide an optimal environment for your children to learn at any time?\n4. How do you teach technological foundations (STEM) without technology?\n5. What activities do you perform outside &#x2F; in nature? (e.g., Usage of animal guides &#x2F; plant guides)\n6. My daughter sees me working a lot with tablet &#x2F; laptop and wants to do the same. (She&#x27;s even &#x27;scheduling meetings&#x27;). How would you deal with this?<p>(</i>) I am familiar with a related question from 2014 (Ask HN: How much screen time do you let your kids have?[1]).\n---\n[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8746045\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;019536936X\n[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dk.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;book&#x2F;9781465447562-5-language-visual-dictionary&#x2F;\n[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;news&#x2F;item&#x2F;24-04-2019-to-grow-up-healthy-children-need-to-sit-less-and-play-more",
