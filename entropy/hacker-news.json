I&#x27;ve discovered a bunch (AppSumo, PitchGround, Dealify, SaasMantra etc.), but talked only with AppSumo so far. Trying to find out more information on it and have a pretty good feeling about PitchGround.<p>Especially interested in digital marketing products, mine is in Local Marketing to be even more precise, but ofc any good story&#x2F;advice will be appreciated :)",
