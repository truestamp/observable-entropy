      "text": "Does anyone have positive experience sharing tens of thousands of photos?  If so, how do you do it?<p>My partner and I are Mac users, and I pay for iCloud.  So my 34k photos&#x2F;videos are backed up automatically.  But unfortunately, it is not possible to share an entire photo library (other than literally sharing the one iCloud account, which is not an option).  Albums can be shared, but only up to 5k photos per album.<p>OneDrive, which I also pay for, has photo sharing it seems.  But the UI for viewing seems very limited.<p>I pay for Tresorit as well, but it likewise doesn&#x27;t have a photo-viewer specific UI for guests that I share with.<p>In the past I&#x27;ve tried other systems like SmugMug, but most seem to fall over with large numbers of photos.  Perhaps some have improved, and maybe someone here has good experience...?<p>I&#x27;m willing to pay another ~ $100&#x2F;yr for a proper solution.<p>Suggestions?",
