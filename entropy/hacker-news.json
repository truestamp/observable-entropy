      "text": "Over the last 8 years as an entrepreneur and a product person, I figured that technology entrepreneurs face a lot of issues when they start their business. Although it&#x27;s just a website or a mobile app, there are hundreds of things an entrepreneur needs to take care of to ensure she hits a product market fitment. There is a lot of handholding that is required in the beginning especially when it comes to product management. Most entrepreneurs do not understand product management or do not take it seriously and that eventually is a business&#x27;s Achilles&#x27;s heel that can decimate the business forever. What is even more annoying is that there is tonnes of literature on the internet and gazillions of books written on product management and an entrepreneur really doesn&#x27;t have time to go through all that. That&#x27;s exactly the reason why I wrote this book which can serve as an easy 100 page something product management playbook for entrepreneurs and can help them launch their products successfully. The book is up for grabs now at URL- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B098W78J6F",
