      "text": "I have been a 1password user since 2010. Back in those days, you used to just type command-\\ and you were logged in.<p>Now, in Chrome, it seems like it always takes a click on the plugin and then a click on the UI-bottom saying &quot;Open 1password&quot; (which does nothing) and then you have to manually open the 1password.app and type in your password before you can use the browser plugins.<p>One thing to note is that I use both safari and chrome. Safari works about 10% of the time on the first try, whereas Chrome works about 60% of the time on the first time. I have no idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong or if this is a regression that others are experiencing, but it is extremely frustrating.  Wishing I stayed on 1password 6 and never upgraded to the subscription.<p>Another frustrating thing about the new selector UI is that it requires mouse input in order to work. My workflow is 90% on the keyboard, and rarely ever do I move my hand to the mouse, so I am trying to figure out a way to go back to the old 1password modal window which was keyboard-operable.<p>Am I the only one that finds 1password 7+ a regression in every way compared to previous versions? The password generation option is hidden and no longer able to easily access previously generated passwords.  When a website messes with the copy&#x2F;paste options, 1password literally cannot cope and I end up needing to open up a notepad, copy and paste the password, and then type the randomly generated password in twice into the website&#x27;s form.",
