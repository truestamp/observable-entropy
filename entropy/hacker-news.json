      "text": "I have multiple Apple devices with Siri enabled on all of them. But I don&#x27;t know why we can&#x27;t ask Siri on any specific device to activate itself. Whenever I say &quot;Hey Siri&quot;, it activates on a random device. For example, at my Mac, it opens Siri on my iPhone which is farther away.
