      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m doing a Master&#x27;s in Music Tech and need to get my math up for DSP programming. I&#x27;m trying to find good self-paced online courses that <i>aren&#x27;t video based</i>. I just want to read text. I need to go back to basics because it&#x27;s been 30 years, but I want to be able to go through content quickly because I was an A+ math student 30 years ago! Any recommendations? The goal is to get to be able to do university level DSP, assume I&#x27;ve forgotten stuff right back to senior high school.",
