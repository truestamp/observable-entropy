      "text": "(Posting as a separate Ask HN since it was suggested https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27770117 )<p>Just because a technology becomes obsolete (which IMO has a negative connotation) it shouldn&#x27;t mean it should be forgotten and the principles used in ingenious designs can&#x27;t be reused elsewhere. Best I can find is museums or history of technology books, but no catalog. Surely there must be some good reference out there?<p>My first thought was wikipedia, but that is too disorganized in this sense because it encompasses much more than technology. I&#x27;m thinking of some sort of outline where one could find collections like [0] in the &#x27;mechanisms&#x27; subsection, and possibly comprising of multiple other subsections such as &#x27;electronics&#x27;, &#x27;agriculture&#x27;, &#x27;materials&#x27;, and so on. Perhaps this is too broad and why we have mixed sources like patents&#x2F;encyclopedias&#x2F;etc?<p>[0] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;507movements.com",
