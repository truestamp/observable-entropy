      "text": "Hi HN!<p>During the last few years, I worked on a few applications built with Go, running on AWS Lambda.<p>As I got to know the platform better, I started to find Go &amp; Lambda to be a really productive combination. The applications were fast, and they ended up being much cheaper to run than what my team &amp; I had built before. It’s probably not the best platform for _every_ application, but I was surprised at how much of our workload worked well on it.<p>As we brought new engineers on to our team and helped them get up to speed with the stack, I found that we were covering a lot of the same topics over and over — especially things like performance, testing and monitoring. Since this knowledge turned out to be very useful for our team, I decided to gather it into a book that will hopefully also be useful to others.<p>This is my first time putting something like this together, so I&#x27;m grateful for any feedback!<p>The book is at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevinmcconnell.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;lambda-go-book&#x2F;hn (with HN discount ;))<p>There&#x27;s also a link on that page to a free sample that you can download without registering.<p>Thanks!<p>Cheers,\nKevin",
