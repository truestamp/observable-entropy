      "text": "I have been learning about ECDH and that the Abelian-ness (specifically the difficulty of the discrete logarithmic problem) depends on the particular curve. The NSA story around Dual_EC_DRBG did not help.<p>Wikipedia: secp256k1 - &quot;\nIt&#x27;s constants were selected in a predictable way, which significantly reduces the possibility that the curve&#x27;s creator inserted any sort of backdoor into the curve.&quot;<p>So my question is what is the doomsday scenario? Wallets are set to hashes of Q (public key derived from P) so this should prevent anyone from having the Q of the ECDH to be able to back into the private key P? Is this accurate?",

      "text": "I think that most of us spend our time on Twitter usually in rage dumping because we&#x27;re forced to interact with random people without common interest.<p>I believe if we could interact with people with common interests on Twitter then we can build meaningful relationships with them.<p>Fortunately we do have access to people on Twitter with common interests - Our followers; But it&#x27;s currently not easy to spot what connects us with our followers as we might not follow back all our followers and even if we do there&#x27;s no guarantee that we&#x27;d see all their tweets or those tweets which matter to us.<p>Hence I&#x27;ve created &#x27;engage followers&#x27; and it works by,<p>1. Monitoring the tweets of our Twitter followers.<p>2. Classifying their tweets according to our chosen topics of interest.<p>3. Sending the list of tweets which matches our topics to us via an email digest and&#x2F;or Auto liking them(So we can check those tweets in the likes section of Twitter).<p>I&#x27;ve seen good results over the past week since I&#x27;ve launched engage followers, Getting to know about some like minded followers on my personal &amp; product accounts. I hope you&#x27;d give it a try and tell me how it can be made more useful.",
