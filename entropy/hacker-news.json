I do not want to serve users who block my ads because I lose money. Are there any solutions for inserting ads on the server-side instead so they can&#x27;t be blocked easily? I can find references only for doing this in video. Failing that, recommendations tools to block users who use ad blocking so they do not take up my resources. Thank you.",
