      "text": "TLDR; account locked out suddenly without any follow-up to my inquiries from customer service over 48+ hours. Sadly, I used to love DO for their balanced pricing, range of services, docs, online written material. I <i>thought</i> they were among the best of the best.<p>Long story short, I&#x27;ve had an account with them for roughly 5+ years as I recall, <i>good</i> credit card on file, monthly bill around $20-50, US address.  I use a few droplets to run dokku&#x2F;docker containers for dev and 1 private Google Outline VPN endpoint, only for me.  I only ssh into these from non-root and root should be turned off completely (but I&#x27;m only a hacker and not a F&#x2F;T systems person).<p>Not sure if it matters but I don&#x27;t do anything nefarious on these droplets-- no webscraping, no botnet creation, no crypto mining.  I don&#x27;t know what else would be considered verboten!?!<p>Try to log in with github, won&#x27;t work and asks for email login.  Try to login from there, and it asks for credit card info for &quot;authorization&quot; although the card is the one on file and being charged for so many years.<p>No recourse, and what a crappy way to treat clients even if they are small potatoes in the grand scheme of things.  Thankfully I am building a new MVP all on AWS and have my company prod there too running for 5 years. So I don&#x27;t have to put up with unprofessional dealings and major risks of service interruption.<p>Assume through no fault of your own that you could be shut out of everything.  You have been warned.",

      "text": "I work on a small software team that develops code for scientific instruments. Our team runs very efficiently, and the focus on code quality is a big part of our culture.<p>However, lately, I have noticed that I&#x27;m unhappy with the intense code review cycles. The features work, have test coverage, and good git history, but we end up with a lot of back and forth until everything is precisely how our architect wants it to be. My perception is that I reached a point where I spend 50% of the time developing a solution (since I have enough architectural and domain knowledge) and the other 50% figuring out what will fly on review and merging back.<p>I do have some conflicting points in mind:\n- My skills have evolved a lot in this process, and I take pride in delivering good-quality code. But now that the learning curve is flattening, I feel the weight of not having enough creative freedom to write something up quickly or try different designs.\n- I see a lot of value in the shared ownership from the lengthy reviews, and we usually end up with better code&#x2F;design as the suggestions are technically sound.\n- I&#x27;m starting to feel like code is implementation detail since our high code standard does not necessarily add more value to users.\n- The focus of reviews is not on correctness but stuff like naming, docstrings, and design. Whenever a colleague makes a suggestion that helps the code improve, I&#x27;m happy to oblige. But lately, I wish I could slip a docstring that explains what is done instead of the why.\n- In essence, we follow open-source library development standards while making a closed source application.\n- The nature of our projects requires big additions to the software, so it is very common to have chained PRs.<p>Have you ever found yourself in such a position? What do you think about code review? Can too much of it be wrong?",
