      "text": "Hello!<p>So I am non technical founder. I am searching for dev shops to help me build a web app. I want to make sure I choose a dev shop that uses that right backend frame work, that is in line with my vision for the product.<p>1.) The Product (Generally) - An online discovery network. User profiles, ability to chat with users. Ability to live stream. Ability to create community groups where many people can interact and chat. Payment integration etc. Filter and search for different users by category. Very feature rich...<p>2.) I want to make sure it&#x27;s a backend framework that is very common and lots of programmers are familiar with. When I am recruiting I want to make sure this the right backend tech stack that is current and relevant and lots of people work with.<p>3.) Want to make sure it is right for scale and for lots of users.<p>Thanks in advance! Been tricky navigating developers since I am non technical, trying to make the right decisions before I go with someone :)",
