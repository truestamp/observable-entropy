      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m Arnav, the creator of Rune. I&#x27;ve been a long-time reader of newsletters.<p>Historically, newsletters have been about sharing a collection of links or short form content. However, with platforms like Substack and Revue becoming the preferred publishing medium for many, newsletter content has become more long-form in nature.<p>As a reader, Gmail, Outlook and other general purpose email clients are less than ideal interfaces for reading this such long form content, let alone remember what I read by annotating, adding notes, etc.<p>After grappling with this problem for a while, I decided to build Rune – a dedicated email client for reading &amp; annotating newsletters.<p>Upon signing up for Rune, you&#x27;ll be assigned a unique email address that you can subscribe to newsletters with or setup autoforwarding to from your email provider of choice.<p>TL;DR: Rune is an alternative email app for reading and annotating newsletter content.<p>Excited for you all to try it :)",
