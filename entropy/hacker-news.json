I am recovering some old photo slides from my father, and I would like to print these in a way that would let me preserve the print for a long time. Reason? Some of these pictures have a strong personal&#x2F;sentimental value and I would love the idea that I can pass these on to future generations within my family.<p>Any of you has experience with some type of printing that guarantees a long preservation? Not necessarily &gt;100 years, but at least several decades? (I am in my 40s, and I seriously plan to stick around for the next 50 years or so).",
