      "text": "Hope it&#x27;s appropriate to discuss here, but I apologize if it&#x27;s not.<p>Does reddit site performance seem to be getting worse and nothing being done by the admins about it?<p>So reddit has infinite scroll and after scrolling through a few hundred posts and watching a few videos, my fans turn on and my computer starts putting out a lot of heat. I even left a reddit tab open on accident one night and woke up to my laptop too hot to even sit on my lap. Once the reddit tab was closed I could immediately hear my fans wind down.<p>I have a 8 core processor and 8 gb of RAM, shouldn&#x27;t that be enough? Should any website need to be using resources the way reddit does? This has been happening for so long that at this point I would think some of the blame needs to be placed on the engineers that designed the site.<p>I think one obvious solution would be to remove content from the DOM after the user has scrolled past it. Does every video I watch stay in memory until I close the tab? No wonder the video player stops working after I watch a few videos.<p>I&#x27;m using Chrome on Fedora 36 btw.",

I used to just bookmark these things, but then when I want to go back (sometimes a couple years later)  the web page is 404.<p>I am testing this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;historio.us but it&#x27;s not free and I can&#x27;t save my own data on my own hard drive.<p>I guess I would save that as a PDF but I was wondering how everyone else manages a knowledge base of which the source are web pages.<p>What we need is a version of historio.us that runs locally.",
