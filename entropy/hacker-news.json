      "text": "I recently started working with a new client. They are a fast growing startup with a successful product. They had previously outsourced some of their initial development. They had only one computer programmer on staff, and he is very junior, with just 1 year of experience. I&#x27;ve been called in to help them hire a tech team and put in places various best practices.<p>One mistake that had previously been made was credentials for 3rd party APIs were embedded in the code and uploaded to Github. Not too big a deal, no harm done, nothing leaked to the public, but still, I&#x27;d like to put in place some automatic monitoring to protect us from this.<p>I&#x27;m aware of 3rd party services such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cybelangel.com&#x2F; but in the past I had the odd experience of getting a warning several weeks after a breach. It would be better to have a much faster warning.<p>Please assume code that contains NodeJS and JVM code. Please assume a fairly traditional devops setup, which might rely on something like Jenkins for deployment.<p>I&#x27;d be grateful for any suggestions regarding:<p>1. 3rd party security monitoring services that you&#x27;ve had a good experience with<p>2. or tools specific for NodeJS<p>3. or tools specific for JVM code<p>4. or tools specific to Github<p>Anything that has worked for you, for catching things like usernames&#x2F;passwords, please let me know.",
