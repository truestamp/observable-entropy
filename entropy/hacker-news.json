(Best meaning you know what you&#x27;re doing, hopefully, but at the cost of possibly more money and time.)<p>Amazon runs and competes w&#x2F; Google offerings for across the board - do you think they&#x27;re better?<p>They are &quot;Ad-Tech&quot; but my opinion has been that Amazon is &quot;marginally&quot; a better steward for cloud because they don&#x27;t close shop&#x2F;projects with little notice - they have many offerings across infrastructure.<p>They also do not have an open-ID esque SSO that ties your identity&#x2F;life into one company - something that Google&#x2F;Microsoft offer though the Microsoft one pales in comparison to Google.<p>I think it&#x27;s also fair to compare against &quot;Microsoft&quot; here too, but IMO MSFT&#x27;s image and privacy policies have vastly improved and are more transparent.<p>They are also in adtech, they have a search engine - bing but I hardly see Amazon discussed in this aspect.<p>Microsoft and Google IMO are much more 1:1 as they offer the same LOB - Google Suite&#x2F;O365, email, etc but Amazon never comes up.",
