      "text": "Rocket is a super exciting Rust framework that lets you write a web server with Flask-like ergonomics. I&#x27;ve used it on a couple toy projects and it&#x27;s a delight.<p>However it&#x27;s still in v0.x, and you have to use the latest RC in order to use it with the stable (non-nightly) Rust compiler. It also seems to have a pretty small maintenance team without any company backing as far as I can tell.<p>So I&#x27;d like to use it at work given an opportunity, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s still too bleeding-edge. Is there anybody who&#x27;s used it for something real and can speak to its reliability&#x2F;general experience?",
