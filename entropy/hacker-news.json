They claimed to remove me. However they followed nearly the same pattern, so I have to wonder if they got better at hiding their tracks and didn&#x27;t end up removing me.<p>Due to the spammy nature of these emails, I would never consider a job opportunity from any of them.<p>I was hoping some HN folks might have some insight on who this business is so I can opt out.",
