      "text": "We launched https:&#x2F;&#x2F;formcan.com, a web form builder. Many people&#x27;s first reaction is, oh, another form builder, reinventing the wheel. The truth is, we&#x27;ve been running https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platoforms.com, a SaaS product that converts PDFs to online forms, for 5 years, so rather than build FormCan from scratch, we got a lot of ideas while running PlatoForms and reused a lot of code when building FormCan. This is how we created FormCan.<p>One of the highlights is the pricing model, most form builder SaaS use a fixed pricing plan. We thought a &#x27;pay as you go&#x27; model would make more sense for our customers, so FormCan will pay as you use it and the bill is based on usage. Prices range from $6 to $36, depending on the number of forms a user uses.  However, Iâ€™ve received some feedback that this payment method is too complicated and that they prefer a fixed pricing plan. So my question is, what is the best pricing model for SaaS, PAGY or a fixed pricing plan? Would you accept PAGY for a form builder product?",

      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m a fresh graduate with a BSc in Comp sci, and I am wondering how reasonable the project I&#x27;m considering taking on as a commission is. I&#x27;m a relatively experienced programmer, but newish to web development.<p>The project is a simple ecommerce site:<p>-A couple of static pages<p>-A product listing, and the ability to add to a cart with various custom options&#x2F;dropdowns<p>-Ability to edit cart<p>-Ability to place order for delivery or pickup<p>-Process payment using stripe.<p>No shipping, no need to worry about stock, as it is a food establishment. It seems pretty doable to me but Im worried about wasting the client&#x27;s time, so I would like some input on how reasonable this would be for me to build in Django and React.<p>I don&#x27;t need perfection, both I and the client will be satisfied with something that loads fast, looks nice, and doesn&#x27;t lose orders. Though I have also found it difficult to research common pitfalls building such a site, as all I get are results related to the marketing side of ecommerce. Thoughts?",
