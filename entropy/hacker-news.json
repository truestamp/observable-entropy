      "text": "Code review is important, but I find it&#x27;s often a momentum-killer. A few things can happen after you open a PR:<p>* Nobody reviews it for days because everyone is busy working on their own stuff. This is likely because code review isn&#x27;t as rewarded as pushing code (&quot;I implemented X&quot; sounds better in a standup than &quot;I reviewed a bunch of PRs yesterday&quot;).<p>* You end up in an endless back and forth with one or more reviewers (e.g. push-review-fix-push-review-fix-push-review...). If this occurs over the course of days, the &quot;fix&quot; portion becomes an interruption where you have to remember the context of the changes, make the changes, then submit them.<p>These are the two instances I can think of off the top of my head, but if you have other examples and strategies for combating them, I&#x27;d love to hear them.",
