      "text": "Hi HN,<p>For the last couple of months a few distinct parties have gained access into my home network. They&#x27;re also tracking sound through landlines in my house. It&#x27;s a really long story but the gist of it is that I got into some back-and-forth on social media, and then things kind of erupted.<p>They have remote access into multiple Macs on my network, they&#x27;re key logging devices, and have backdoor access into many web accounts (Google, Facebook, Twitter to name a few). I don&#x27;t think I can do anything about the last one, but I&#x27;m hoping for assistance in getting them out of my network. They&#x27;ve referenced private data from those services (like Google Photos, YouTube history, Discord conversations, etc) and have referenced conversations I&#x27;m having in my home. They&#x27;re running intricate botnets and have been controlling my feeds on Twitter, Mastodon, Facebook, YouTube, and maybe more.<p>I&#x27;ve contacted a lawyer, but they were unable to help. I&#x27;m fairly sure they don&#x27;t want anything other than to annoy me, so at this point I&#x27;m not particularly keen on taking legal action, but I&#x27;m hoping for sophisticated resources, contacts, or anecdotes for getting them out of my network.<p>Thanks.",
