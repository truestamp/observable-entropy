I would like to give them to a local group who would get some use out of them (e.g. a coder dojo or other youth education project) but this is proving to be harder than expected.<p>Any suggestions on alternate places I could donate them where they would actually get use? I was considering selling them as a job lot and donating the money to a local charity all else failing.<p>P.s. If anyone has an idea of a personal project I could throw together in the interim while they&#x27;re just sitting here waiting for a new home, let me know too!",
