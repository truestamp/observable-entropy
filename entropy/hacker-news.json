      "text": "Hey everyone!<p>I&#x27;ve been producing some content for a friend of mine that requires a number of people&#x27;s faces to be blurred for compliance reasons. In short, *I&#x27;m looking for an open source tool that can automatically blur faces in 4k video in rendered output*, (everything is post production no live-streaming).  Initially the duration, resolution and format of the video made it possible to do this with the &quot;ai backed&quot; tool in Adobe Premiere.  However, now I&#x27;m working with 4k footage and the video has shifted to a format with a single face moving too far around the frame for Adobe&#x27;s tool to be useable or has multiple faces.<p>I&#x27;m not a domain expert here, since the last time I did anything with ML was five years ago in college.  Even if I could get the model together, writing a pipeline to actually blur 4k video is a mystery to me (although I&#x27;m open to suggestions as to how I could align these coordinates to apply blurring).  Please note, I&#x27;m not looking for a tool to do this live, however I do need something that can handle 4k video.  I also have access to an RTX 3090 and my render box with a few RTX a5000 gpus.<p>Basically, I&#x27;d pay for a service that does this - however I figured I&#x27;d post here on HN to find a project I could potentially support via open source!  Any &#x2F; all recommendations are appreciated!<p>Cheers!",
