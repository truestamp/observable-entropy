I&#x27;m using postgres but I&#x27;m fine with anything that requires a little bit of scripting or config files as long as it doesn&#x27;t require yet another free trial of barely useful. The non-free ones that I have tried, have huge usability issues such as requiring me to drag literally every table into the diagram, one by one, and also the auto-arrange feature made an obsurdly large diagram with cartoonishly high amounts of whitespace.<p>Long term, I&#x27;d like to be able to automatically generate 5-10 ERDs (because all-in-one is too big) of these as part of my CI&#x2F;CD process for my documentation.",
