      "text": "Hi hackers!<p>I recently tried to get a stack of microservices running in a docker-compose sandbox for integration testing using their original (e.g. prod) configuration.\nThis means I didn&#x27;t know what credentials they&#x27;d be using or what database name.<p>So I hacked together a postgresql proxy using an existing project (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KnifeMaster007&#x2F;pgAuthProxy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KnifeMaster007&#x2F;pgAuthProxy</a>) and simply allow any credentials to connect and make sure the desired database exists before returning control to the caller.<p>Sharing this in the hopes it is useful for someone else.<p>Lucas",
