Employee had health issues and other life events that made the company&#x27;s leadership give person a chance to improve. It is clear the person is not going to perform at the required level. Any guidance or frameworks to rationalize termination? I have not done this before and really not looking forward to it. HR is not being too helpful.",

I was wondering if any of you remix users (or potential remix users) have felt that remix is missing something that could be added by a third party. Whether it is something that could be addressed through a package or if its a monitoring tool that could be developed or a chrome dev tool for debugging and testing. Really anything that comes to mind, I would love to hear it. Thanks for helping out a newbie and giving inspiration!",
