      "text": "Right now, I&#x27;m a software engineer at Microsoft. However, I&#x27;m wanting to move to a Web3 startup (well, if they give me a good offer). Yes, I am aware of the &quot;problems&quot; about blockchain&#x2F;Web3 and that everyone hates it.<p>My heart and gut is telling me that I should go with the Web3 startup, no matter how much I convince myself otherwise. My mom is largely warning me against the idea of me joining one and pushes the idea of a &quot;stable&quot; job on me.<p>I get where she comes from, but even with my tech choices I was historically not the &quot;default&quot; or &quot;most popular&quot; type, I liked trying something different. Well, unless I really like a particular piece of software, like with FreeBSD, where I am a committer. But even then, my FreeBSD laptop is a very new HP Spectre x360 14 and not the &quot;safe&quot; option of a 10-year-old ThinkPad X220&#x2F;T420, and I like Gnome even if everyone else doesn&#x27;t.<p>Going back, I feel more entrepreneurial and not cut out for a &quot;corporate job&quot;, I want to innovate on my job and take ownership. At the same time, with other important metrics like work-life balance and compensation, a &quot;big company&quot; also has its wins. But even at Microsoft I do have times when I am pretty much idle (even if I ask for work) nor do I want to work in &quot;Big Data&quot; forever either.<p>For reference, the startup is a Series B company. I also have interviews with another series C Web3 company, and a &quot;big&quot; firm (not FAANGMULA, but more like Pinterest or Dropbox sized).<p>However, about you all HN readers, especially those who worked at both startups and big companies (doesn&#x27;t have to be FAANG), which do you prefer and why? I am leaning towards the Web3 startup if I get it, but also want other perspectives.<p>Yes, I did have an internship at a (now-dead) crypto CDN startup who almost hired me full-time, well before Microsoft came in.",
