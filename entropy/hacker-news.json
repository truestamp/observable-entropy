So I don&#x27;t have to plug and unplug it as I walk away from my desk with my laptop. I could just buy a bluetooth mouse but I prefer to keep this one.<p>All the pieces needed seem to be there. I&#x27;d like to be able to connect my mouse to a Raspberry PI via USB and then have the PI talk to my laptop via bluetooth. The laptop needs to connect to the PI via bluetooth and detect it as a bluetooth mouse. How can I configure the PI to do this?",
