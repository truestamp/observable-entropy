The last two and a half months have all been HR and paperwork intensive in terms of getting the offer approved internally.<p>How long has it taken others to get through the process? This is by far the longest interview cycle I&#x27;ve ever had and was wondering whether waiting this long for an offer is acceptable, even for FAANG level jobs.",
