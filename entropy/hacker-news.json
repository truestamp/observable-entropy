      "text": "I&#x27;m thinking of writing an open-source library for investing &#x2F; trading purposes. I already have some code scattered around my projects but it would be better to extract common stuff to a lib. Being more or less proficient in Java and Rust I consider these two languages equally.\nSo I wanted to &quot;measure&quot; what would be a better fit and I came up with the following table:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;cL3GJT9<p>So &#x27;Metric&#x27; is what I&#x27;m looking at when deciding. &#x27;Weight&#x27; is my (a bit subjective) importance for the metric. &#x27;Value&#x27; is how good language X is for this metric, and &#x27;Score&#x27; is the metric multiplied by the value.\nSome metrics are positive, some are negative, but I made &#x27;Value&#x27; to be &#x27;more is better&#x27; for all of them.\nMy metrics:\nperformance - It hurts to say, but I&#x27;ve tested some very first task that I would like to do and Java turns out to be almost 50% quicker.\nfun - It&#x27;s about my feeling when working in this language.\npopularity - I will care about adoption rate and pull requests from other developers.\nsyntax - This one is more about expressiveness and being less error-prone.\ntesting - It seems to me that Java is more mature here, for example, mutation testing is a lot better than in Rust.\ncompetition - I guess it&#x27;s the reverse of popularity. I haven&#x27;t found anything like this in Rust&#x27;s world, but similar stuff exists in Java.<p>My question is: What did I miss? What do you think? The values above are a bit subjective and I can tweak them to show that Java&#x27;s better for this.\nI&#x27;m asking here to get more objective input.\nThanks.",
