I&#x27;ll probably open-source the code next week or so.",

      "text": "Currently I&#x27;m unemployed and I also have the curiosity of a student- trying to build a network with professionals and to get a smorgasbord of tech company offers while remaining very open.<p>My network isn&#x27;t very strong, technical skills are lacking, and I am having trouble planning my time to work on all these things.<p>I don&#x27;t want to limit myself to just FAANG. I am mostly interested in offers for high pay and the opportunity to learn a lot more from engineers in my next 2 years of work than I did in my past 5. Having a company that can provide health insurance and being able to contribute to 401k would be nice too, I never had that before. Wanna make my immigrant parents proud and I feel I&#x27;ve let them down with as someone who hasn&#x27;t held a steady job in more than 10 years.<p>For my experience, I have spent the last 2 years unemployed and the last 12 before that going on and off temp work for various startups and other small companies. Nothing that involved more than 5 people in a project. Sometimes it&#x27;s web boutique work other times it&#x27;s a SaaS web project. JavaScript and PHP have been my main tools but I am fine with trying out others.<p>Counterintuitively, from the perspective of getting an interview at high-paying companies, my 12 years of doing work as a freelancer is seen as inferior to a handful of internships. I especially know from speaking to someone else that&#x27;s much newer to the industry, that he got the attention from companies such as Github and Intel with research projects and academic publications. He took internships from both.<p>As someone who&#x27;s graduated long ago, I clearly don&#x27;t have those extracurricular options. So I&#x27;m interested in some career &quot;side quests&quot; for the under-skilled and out of school, that aren&#x27;t just personal side projects, and trying to go above and beyond. My unemployment just means I should have more spare time to get involved in them.<p>Are there hackathons open for any programmer no matter their experience level that are worth attending? Interesting coding challenges sponsored by big companies? I need to add things on my resume that I can start doing right now to make a lot of tech companies say &quot;let&#x27;s interview him&quot;. In the geographic area where I live, there are rarely any opportunities to network with people in big tech.",
