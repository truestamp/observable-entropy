Ironclad plausible deniability.<p>I&#x27;ve seen several comments from software engineers saying that they&#x27;d love to join the cyber fight but won&#x27;t because doing so is, of course, illegal.<p>But San Francisco has a consulate, and so it got me thinking about this option.<p>Ukraine is now openly calling for international volunteers to support both combat and cyberwarfare operations. Perhaps they&#x27;d be amenable to allowing some of the best hackers on the planet through their doors to fight with impunity.<p>I&#x27;m not encouraging people to do this, more just a morbid curiosity about the mechanics and plausibility of it as a strategy. We&#x27;re seeing a whole lot of technological elements we (or at least most people) have never seen in war over the past few days.",
