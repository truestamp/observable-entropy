      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Nextcloud, which is not that great.  The text chat interface is confusing, installation was painful last time I did it, and the voice and video parts were hard to get working on my laptop.  IIRC the Android phone app didn&#x27;t work for chat.  I don&#x27;t know whether there is an iPhone app, so in either case, I haven&#x27;t tried it.<p>I&#x27;d be using this mostly to talk to family, including my mom who is quite elderly and is thrown off a lot by interface elements changing, fonts changing, etc.  IRC is really better than any web chat app I know of, except it doesn&#x27;t keep scrollback when the client is disconnected.  It is important to be able to use text and video at the same time, since her hearing is poor so it&#x27;s better to type text that she can read.<p>My mom uses a Debian laptop that I set up for her, so if there&#x27;s a Linux desktop app that&#x27;s better than the web interface, that&#x27;s great.  She doesn&#x27;t use mobile phones at all.  I could imagine mobile apps also being worthwhile though, for users other than my mom.  My sister uses an iPhone so the availability of an iPhone app would be nice.<p>I&#x27;ve tried the hosted version of Jitsi Meet (meet.jit.si) and it was nice.  I haven&#x27;t tried self-hosting it yet.  I&#x27;m happy to hear about experiences, and also about anything else interesting that is out there.<p>Thanks!",
