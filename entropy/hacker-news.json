Now everything looks great in terms of job prospects, income (100-160K ranges) but one thing that worries me is that my partner has a chronic disease and we are worried that in the US it could potentially make us bankrupt and we&#x27;re better off staying in the UK.<p>We read horrific stories about healthcare in the US, but I&#x27;m wondering if having an income and the privileges that come with a SWE job, would it put us in a more comfortable place?<p>Can anyone help shed some light on healthcare situations but for SWE&#x2F;people with equivalent financial situation. Does it make a difference? What things to look for?<p>Thanks a lot!",
