      "text": "Currently, Twitter is awash with disinformation about the Russia&#x2F;Ukraine war - but seem to be doing very little&#x2F;nothing to combat it. There isn’t even a “disinformation” report category, just “hateful content” - and nothing is ever counted as hateful content, except for if you say “it’d be a shame if they had an accident”, which will get you suspended from the platform.<p>So. Would anyone from Twitter care to comment? Is this about conflict driving ad views? Because to me, profiting from a war in which thousands of civilians are dying seems a bit beyond the pale.",
