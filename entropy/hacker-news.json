I studied something completely unrelated and taught myself. I live in Europe.<p>While I&#x27;m generally ok at writing code and know better than to put a loop within a loop, I can&#x27;t hope to do well in algorithms or CS theory.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a new job at the moment but the &quot;code challenges&quot; are killing me. Even more so than usual this time around because I think with my 10+ years I get evaluated for Senior roles. It is incredibly demoralizing to be reminded of all the ways you can fail with every interview.<p>I love programming but I&#x27;m getting more and more tired of the interviews. How much do you really need to know to add a button to yet another CRUD app?<p>I&#x27;ve considered several options:<p>- Refuse to do code challenges altogether. I should note that I have several open source projects on my GitHub that I&#x27;d volunteer for examination or even pair-programming on<p>- Aim for the jobs that require 3-5 YoE, so that I don&#x27;t get evaluated against senior contributor criteria<p>- Switch out of programming and to something related (but what? endless meetings or politics isn&#x27;t really my thing)<p>Have you ever been in that situation? How did you get out of it?",
