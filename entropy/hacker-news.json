      "text": "Something weird is happening with Quickbooks.<p>I am resident in Ghana but having a New York registered LLC through which I provide software engineering consulting services to US clients. Since I opened a new account with Quickbooks Oline to receive payments for the LLC, they have asked for all kinds of verification, which I have provided.<p>It&#x27;s been weeks now since a client paid a substantial invoice, and Quickbooks they are still holding it up without depositing it. Worse, they have disabled all my intuit accounts (and yet continue to charge me for it). Even my free Mint account no longer works.<p>I have had numerous calls and chats with them to explain what I do and how I intend to use their services, all to no avail. After wasting a lot of time to contact a rep today, I was informed I need to provide a utility bill for my business address. Since I&#x27;m not in the US, and I&#x27;m using a registered agent, whose address I cannot provide a utility bill for.<p>So at this point, I&#x27;m asking my client to request a refund from them. I will also be contacting Paypal and my bank to file a dispute for the subscription fees I have paid them, since they are unable to provide the service I have paid for.<p>Think twice before using Quickbooks.",
