      "text": "I have an offer from AWS and as part of that they want me to sign a non-compete. I&#x27;ve signed non-competes in the past but reading through the AWS one is making me very nervous.<p>It basically limits me for working for a competitor of ALL of amazon for 18 months. Amazon does literally everything! I would pretty much be locked out of a job for 18 months if I left voluntarily or not.<p>All other non-competes I&#x27;ve signed have been scoped to just the areas of the business which I have confidential info about. This amazon non-compete make me worried I could be sued for even getting a job as a grocery bagger because it competes with their grocery chains?<p>Have any of you who work for AWS re-negotiated your non-competes? I would be ok signing a non-compete that is just limited to areas which I have confidential information about but I&#x27;m worried that asking the hiring manager about this might cause them to pull the offer.",
