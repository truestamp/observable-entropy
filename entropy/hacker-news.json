      "text": "A friend of mine is starting a position at a new startup whose founder is a former colleague of him. He recommended me, we had a quick interview and I&#x27;ve already received an offer.<p>As the title says, the salary is almost half of what I&#x27;m earning at my current job so clearly I&#x27;m not considering it, but before rejecting the proposal it&#x27;d be nice to give it a shot and see if they can improve the offer. I&#x27;m pretty burned out from my current job and it&#x27;d be great to move to another place.<p>Have you dealt with a similar situation? How do you handled it and what was the outcome?",
