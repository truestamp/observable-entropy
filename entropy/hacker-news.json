      "text": "I saw a benign-but-valuable submission flagged. The submission was getting upvotes and there was discussion. It would be useful if respectable long-term users with high karma could see who flagged posts that get flagged, particularly when the submission is amassing upvotes and discussion. Otherwise, this place is no longer any better than reddit where astroturfing, gaslighting, and brigading are now the norm.<p>These high-karma users would then be able to vet flags and remove flags that may be coordinated. We need to face the reality that there can be coordinated flagging that is designed to wedge an ideological bent into the flow of the conversation.",

Is Flutter&#x27;s web app support fleshed out enough? Blazor &#x2F; Bolero seem good except for shipping the entire .Net runtime to the browser as WASM.<p>Are any of the Rust -&gt; WASM projects mature enough to provide a pleasant and quick developer experience?<p>I&#x27;m asking because many of my side projects stall out when I get to coding a front-end; I lose the passion as I don&#x27;t find coding for the browser enjoyable regardless of the frameworks I have tried.
