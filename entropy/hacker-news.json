      "text": "Thanks for reaching out to us about the recent bill in Australia. We love that our customers care about their digital rights and want to find out more about how companies are looking after their information.<p>The police can&#x27;t intercept, access or modify your messages without us receiving a warrant, and we take our duty of care seriously. Fastmail responds to well formed warrants only and challenges requests for access that are inappropriate, either in scope (not adequately targeted), or depth (asking for information that seems out of proportion to what&#x27;s being investigated). We will continue to do so, for any legislation that applies to us both now and in the future.<p>The new bill still doesn&#x27;t allow &#x27;trawling&#x27; for suspicious data: they can&#x27;t request access to a wide variety of accounts hoping they&#x27;ll come across something of interest. They need to have a particular account under suspicion and something that gives them grounds for that suspicion, and the offence in question needs to be suitably severe to be worth the intrusion.<p>Where we are permitted under a warrant, we will notify the accountholder of the access request, and due to our existing measures to help customers stay aware of any hackers compromising their account, police can&#x27;t also enter your account without leaving evidence you can see.<p>What this means for you: Fastmail remains a privacy-first provider. We will comply with our legislated duties, while taking care to ensure that we do not act unless compelled by law and that all legislated preconditions have been properly satisfied. Your data remains under your control and you can rest comfortably knowing that your account won&#x27;t get caught up in a surveillance net.",
