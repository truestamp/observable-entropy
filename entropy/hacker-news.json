      "text": "Ever since I found PHP desktop (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cztomczak&#x2F;phpdesktop), I&#x27;ve been having a blast playing around with it. I&#x27;ve created my own &quot;desktop applications&quot; that I use daily. It&#x27;s quick to build something I need to run locally (on Windows) vs learning&#x2F;building an actual Windows application. Also I find PHP easier to build MVPs over Javascript (i.e. Electron). I&#x27;m curious if anybody else is building anything using PHP desktop? What kind of applications&#x2F;services did you build or using with it?",

      "text": "Performance review is a topic I’m currently struggling with. I believe I’m fairly consistent with the quality of my work and I feel like I’ve been performing pretty well so far, but whenever we come around performance review times where I need to gather feedback from my peers and also give performance feedback for others, I have a hard time reasoning about it. Most of the time, I just feel like this is a waste of time.<p>This is the first $job I work at where this is taken seriously, so I’m not sure whether I’m just not experienced enough with this kind of process or this is indeed counter productive.<p>So I’m reaching out to the HN community and would like to hear your opinion about performance reviews. Is there something I’m missing in order to truly see the value of it?<p>Let me know your opinion. Cheers!",
