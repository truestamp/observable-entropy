      "text": "Hello.<p>I have two video streams, one of my baby&#x27;s crib, and another of our bedroom bed. I want to know when my baby is asleep in our bed (and not in his crib), and somehow be notified when this occurs.<p>Where could I find resources on how to detect when the baby is or isn&#x27;t in our bed? It might get kinda hard (or impossible?) because there&#x27;s two adults sleeping, and we&#x27;re all covered in sheets. Maybe there would be more reliable methods, like breathing detectors, a wristband, or something else. I&#x27;m only limited by budget and availability. I have used OpenCV before in college, but in very limited scope.",
