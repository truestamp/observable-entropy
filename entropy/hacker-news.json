I ended up running ReactOS on UTM, after trying Linux. On the M1 it was somewhat painful - so many steps to get something running.<p>So I’m curious - what’s stopping anyone from getting Linux, ReactOS or any desktop OS really from running purely client side using WASM?<p>From retro gaming to opening legacy files to safely testing out binaries, seems like a lot of personal use cases. I can imagine tons more for companies.<p>Is it performance? Missing features?",
