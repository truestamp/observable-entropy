      "text": "Got a brand new thinkpad p1 gen4. Installed Ubuntu 21.10. Everything worked like a charm. Never expected it to be so smooth. Even bluetooth worked. Didn&#x27;t believe it.<p>So I had only one step to do. Install Nvidia drivers. Used autoinstall. And surprise, surprise it broke something. \nMultitouch gestures stopped working. Spend multiple hours to realize it. Another drivers didn&#x27;t help.<p>Anyway for me the general question was. How do I revert apt get commands? It seems kind of difficult. I could purge all nvidia stuff or whatever. BUT is there maybe some general solution? That is the reason I&#x27;m always afraid of apt upgrade. It may break something and I have no idea how to restore. But maybe it&#x27;s just a newbie question. Is it?",

I don&#x27;t want to install them directly in the Hard Drive with Dual Boot. So I installed the Rocky Linux onto a Pen Drive and whenever I want to boot RockyLinux, I simply plug in my Pen Drive and hit the boot options and choose.<p>This is working Great so far, despite little sluggishness due to the Pen Drive Speed(I&#x27;m looking for a faster one).<p>Is anyone using the same option and is Pen Drive a Safe boot option, will it get corrupt ?",
