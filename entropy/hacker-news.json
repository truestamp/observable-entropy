Socrates is a man), no clear conflicting logic can be generated regarding this statement of material fact.<p>2. If arguments can be presented, but not properly resolved, due to flaws in the logic of an object and&#x2F;or system, then our understanding of the system - or the system itself is  invalid.<p>(E.g. 2 + 2 = 4 in every circumstance. -&gt; If 2 + 2 = 12 on just only Friday, then our conceptual understanding of math would be invalid, OR math itself would be flawed by not having consistency and predictability)<p>3. A paradox is equivalent to an argument that cannot be properly resolved and therefore (2) -&gt; our understanding of the system - or the system itself is incomplete and therefore invalid.<p>(E.g.
