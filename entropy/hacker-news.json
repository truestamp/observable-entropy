      "text": "I know this sounds awful and controversial but I&#x27;m not talking about war profiteering.\nI&#x27;m wondering, in any crisis there are those that end up making a profit from the situation and I don&#x27;t think this one will be different. \nFor example, during the worst phase of the COVID pandemic I saw some industries grow thanks to the crisis, like gambling, detergent products, home delivery of anything, you name it. One that particularly hurts is the home delivery services because I wasn&#x27;t able to notice the need so, I want to be more aware of opportunities that arise because of the current conflict, especially if it&#x27;s something helpful that can make me some money.",
