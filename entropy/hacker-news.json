      "text": "I&#x27;m a fairly senior agency grunt who has been building web sites and applications for around a decade. I enjoy it but would just like more free time for projects, hikes, etc. If I could earn 3&#x2F;5ths of my salary for working 3&#x2F;5ths my current time, I&#x27;d take it. Really, I&#x27;d be open 2&#x2F;5th - 4&#x2F;5th or working full time with some extended time off between projects. I&#x27;m not a great networker so not sure freelance would be the easiest option for me but I&#x27;d be open. I&#x27;m just looking for ideas and to hear from others about their experiences.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve inherited an application at a startup that has been built on Shopify due to resource and business constraints while trying to find product market fit. As time has gone on we&#x27;ve been fighting with limitations of the platform along with developer experience. I was wondering if anyone here has been in a similar situation and how then went about migrating off of the platform. Ideally this would need to be incremental due to the demands of the business. Taking a pause to do a complete rewrite using the headless API would be hard to justify to the business at the current stage.",
