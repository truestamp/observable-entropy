      "text": "At work, I need to work with 3 laptops (3 mac book pros).<p>My employer is happy to pay for whatever hardware or software to make it easier.<p>What setup should I go for?<p>I thought about the following options<p>1) my current setup\nI simply have the 3 laptops sitting on the desk, and 1 screen. I move one laptop to the center of the desk, unplug the hdmi cable to the screen of the other laptop, and plug it in the laptop I want to use.\nThis is a bit unwieldy, and there&#x27;s a lot of unplugging&#x2F;replugging<p>2) 1 keyboard, 1 trackpad, 1 screen\nA better option might be to have 1 external keyboard, 1 external trackpad, 1 screen. Laptops would stay on the side of the desk, and I would have a little hardware box on which I click a button that says which laptop the screen&#x2F;keyboard&#x2F;trackpad are linked to.\nDoes such a box even exist? Does it make sense?<p>There are probably good options that I am missing. I&#x27;d be grateful for any thoughts. Thanks!",
