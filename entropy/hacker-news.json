      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for software that is powerful, understandable, hackable, extensible, reliable, future-proof (few breaking updates) and feature-rich.<p>The two tools I&#x27;ve found so far that come close to this are TiddlyWiki (notetaking) and Vim&#x2F;Emacs (same text editor niche). TiddlyWiki loses some points on hackability because it&#x27;s web technology and fairly sandboxed. Vim&#x2F;Emacs are only for text, obviously. I think what these tools have in common is that they all have a strong core idea (Vim: modal, TiddlyWiki: a quine of tiddlers, Emacs: elisp) that provides insane feature breadth at relatively low cost to learnability.<p>Other software is usually on a spectrum of low feature count (most tools in the UNIX philosophy) to low understandability (IDEs, most other text editors, all OSes). Then a few rare ones are extremely powerful, but so old and poorly designed that I don&#x27;t think they make the cut (e.g. Bash in my opinion).<p>Are there other tools similar to Vim, that maybe even cover other application areas? Doesn&#x27;t have to be terminal-based. I&#x27;d love to hear your opinions!",
