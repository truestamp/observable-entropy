      "text": "There&#x27;s an organization that assists soldiers returning to civilian life that has a Facebook page. They list their website address on their FB page but FB blocks taking users through to the website. FB claims the site violates community standards. The organization is aware of the issue and says they have tried contacting FB to get clarification on the issue and try to remedy it several times over the past few years. They have never gotten a response.<p>We can argue and rage about &quot;how awful&quot; the US military is, but that doesn&#x27;t seem productive. Healing and restoring soldiers mental health that have gone through some of the questionable and traumatic experiences they&#x27;ve had seems like a worthy and noble cause.<p>I&#x27;m honestly asking for anyone&#x27;s insight into what standard is being violated (it seems to me that some AI has flagged the site incorrectly in regards to suicide) and or how one can get better answers from FB.<p>Sincerely and thank you.<p>P.S. The website is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;operationrestoredwarrior.org&#x2F;",
