      "text": "Nbb is a scripting environment that aims to make it easier to create ad-hoc scripts on Node.js using ClojureScript. It does not need a JVM for compilation: just use npm and you&#x27;re good to go. Code is interpreted instead of compiled, which for scripting is usually ok. If your project outgrows the scripting phase, you can migrate to a proper ClojureScript compiler setup. Give it a try if you&#x27;re curious about ClojureScript.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;borkdude&#x2F;nbb",
