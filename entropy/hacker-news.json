      "text": "I&#x27;m currently making an app using SwiftUI. Though it&#x27;s mostly fantastic, there are times I need to access UIKit. I&#x27;ve gotten by so far, but I feel out of my element if I want to leverage this technology more. Because the official docs are sparse in examples, I was wondering what are some good resources that I can refer to instead?<p>* I&#x27;m looking for resources that are technically moderately advanced, rather than beginner level tutorials and so on. Thanks!",
