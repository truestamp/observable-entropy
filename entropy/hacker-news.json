      "text": "So my vacation plans fell through, I was supposed to travel but because of COVID, I&#x27;ve had to cancel. Which means I have 3 weeks to do absolutely nothing. I want to occupy myself. I&#x27;m not much of an idea guy, but am a seasoned engineer.<p>I want to work on building either an API or a dataset. Any field, the only requirement is that is it be useful to someone or some people.<p>So if you have any ideas on what might be worthwhile or useful to work on.. or even just lots of fun, please let me know. I have way too much time on my hands. Thanks.",
