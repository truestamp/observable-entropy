      "text": "Question relates to the use of PostCSS in React.\nContext:\nThere are lots of plugins done by Johnathan Neal (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jonneal.dev&#x2F;), but these plugins are CC0-1.0 licensed.\nIn section 4.a of the license states &quot;No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.&quot;<p>Question 1: Is PostCSS thus patent encumbered  by the use of Neal&#x27;s libraries or any CC0-1.0 library for that matter?\nQuestion 2: PostCSS can be seen as a &quot;compiler&quot; in that it transmutes CSS source code. Is this seen as a business process, which can be patentable?\nQuestion 3: And the use of this business process, the produced artefact (the &quot;compiled&quot; CSS) is shipping that CSS liable for any \npatent royalties?\nQuestion 4: Are there any projects that removed the CC0-1.0 libraries from PluginCSS which I can follow?<p>Thanks for any insights. The last thing I want to do is to make an app and my employer gets sued.",
