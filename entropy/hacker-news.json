      "text": "https:&#x2F;&#x2F;naskodaskalov.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;VLOST<p>Hi everyone,\nIn the last couple of months in my projects I am mostly using NextJS as a starting point and then I am adding all other stuffs, like Firebase (or MongoDB, it depends of the project), TailwindCSS, Redux, NextAuth and everything else needed for the project. In the begining for these steps I was spending hours (to take the package, configure it, test it, then reconfigure again, test it again and at some point to see that it’s finally working).\nAfter so much friends asked me how I am starting my projects, what are the initial steps, I’ve decided to make a startup template with all needed to start a project as fast as possible and continue building the fun parts.<p>To get access to the template, you can visit the Gumroad page &lt;a href=“https:&#x2F;&#x2F;naskodaskalov.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;VLOST”&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and order it. For now the price is $55. All future support of the template is included, so all buyers will get always the latest version.\nIf you decide to give it a try, let me know what are your thoughts after you test it and of course if you are facing any issues — write me(naskogdaskalov@gmail.com) and I will help you.",
