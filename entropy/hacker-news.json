      "text": "I cobbled this together as part of a wlan project a few years ago. I am not an Ubuntu &#x2F; networking stack native and there was a decent amount of research involved to solve across platforms, browsers, etc. Following a HN discussion[1] last week I thought it might be worth extracting the relevant juicy bits into a gist.<p>Separate to this was an OS-specific landing page flow that explained how to &quot;accept&quot; the captive portal (with overlays &#x2F; pointers in the correct part of the screen). I haven&#x27;t included this but might add some screenshots per device when I get a chance.<p>Thoughts &#x2F; criticisms &#x2F; improvements most appreciated.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32092104\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32092104</a>",
