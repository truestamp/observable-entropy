I&#x27;ve created my own &quot;desktop applications&quot; that I use daily. It&#x27;s quick to build something I need to run locally (on Windows) vs learning&#x2F;building an actual Windows application. Also I find PHP easier to build MVPs over Javascript (i.e. Electron). I&#x27;m curious if anybody else is building anything using PHP desktop? What kind of applications&#x2F;services did you build or using with it?",
