      "text": "There was this native-american chief - from a Plains tribe - I presume nomadic. At any rate, they lived in teepees.<p>A chief could have more than one wife, and this guy had three. He decided they needed improved bedding, so he got them new animal hides.<p>Wife no. 1 got a new buffalo hide. Easy, buffalo were roaming the plains.<p>Wife no. 2 got bedding made from several lynx hides, stitched together (you could make a handbag out of one montain-lion, but it&#x27;s not enough for a blanket).<p>Wife no. 3 presented a problem. So the chief got onto Amazon, and ordered a hippopotamus hide, which was delivered by drone a few hours later.<p>The chief and his wives all slept in the same teepee; and in due course, all three wives became pregnant.<p>The first wive gave birth to a son.<p>The second wife also had a son.<p>The third wife had <i>two</i> sons.<p>The moral of that story is &quot;The squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to the sons of the squaws on the other two hides&quot;.",
