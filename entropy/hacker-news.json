I don&#x27;t have any way of recovering my account. I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of and wanted to share my experience in case someone has gone through the same thing. Also, if you know anyone in Meta that can help that would be great. I&#x27;ve gone through all the help center suggestions for recovery. Also, the email notifications I received when the changes were made had &quot;recovery&quot; links that never worked. I appreciate anyones help in advance.",

They will be endowed with agency over originally human APIs: screen+keyboard&#x2F;mouse in the digital realm and humanoid bodies in the physical realm. And gradually they will swap us out.\n</code></pre>\nI work professionally in the machine learning field. Some of my colleagues and myself are realizing that we&#x27;re pursuing goals that will reduce the value of human intelligence and creativity, commoditizing them.<p>Pandora&#x27;s Box has been opened.<p>As a society we can reject this technology. Reject automated artwork like Dall-E 2, reject automated literature, and so on. Reject technologies that replace the human mind instead of assisting it.<p>In your opinion, would a social movement organized around this idea find traction?",
