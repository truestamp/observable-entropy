      "text": "I&#x27;m mid-thirties working in Software&#x2F;Data Engineering. I&#x27;ve been working at different companies during the last decade, and currently making ~$120k, and hitting no more than 40h&#x2F;week.<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself especially intelligent. Neither I&#x27;m dumb. I suffer from imposter syndrome from time to time, especially when I start a new job&#x2F;challenge. I usually acknowledge these situations and manage to drive them without major problems. I have been in places where I was making way more but the job was boring, in startups where I was learning x10 every single day, I cut my salary to join especially talented teams, I stayed at places that required less than 10h&#x2F;week while being paid for 40h... Sometimes I have been focused on pursuing a bigger salary, a promotion, or becoming a manager. I successfully accomplish most of these challenges. Every single situation had pros and cons, and none of them made me feel completely full-filled.<p>I thought I had a pretty good work-life balance but lately, I&#x27;ve been through health issues and every single doctor&#x2F;therapist is pointing out to stress and sedentarism. Due to that, I&#x27;ve been reading some articles where researchers explain how people in tech started to care more about happiness and less about salary. I thought I was already doing that but looks like I&#x27;ve been doing something wrong with my professional career, and there is a path more equilibrated and focused on happiness I should follow.<p>Do you do something special?",
