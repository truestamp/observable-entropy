      "text": "Hello HN,<p>We’re a small software consultancy (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;featurist.co.uk&#x2F;). We have been very successful writing web software for our clients for some 10 years now. However, we want to gradually transition to working on our own products. It’s more fun and hopefully more profitable too.<p>This is of course easier said than done. We did some research and figured that before anything else we need to speak to potential customers and understand their real pain points and where new products could help. We have then tried to engage with people directly (via twitter dm and reddit posts) but to no avail so far. It now feels like we’re doing something wrong and we should probably look for some help.<p>So here are my questions:<p>- How do consultancies make that hop in general? What are the key insights?\n- In our particular case, who are the people that could help and where do we find them?<p>Thanks!\nArtem",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Brave browser for a solid month now, I installed it October 25th and forced myself to use it consistently for a month. Generally I&#x27;d say:<p>- Feels snappier than Chrome, could very well be my imagination but I don&#x27;t see it killing my laptop nor do I find I get tabs locking up, these things both happen once or twice a week with Chrome.<p>- Ad management in Brave is very aggressive and frequently have to &quot;turn down shields&quot; (a button to turn off all the blocking) - this ends up being an issue on my brokerage platform, condo management app, stuff like that but it&#x27;s easy to turn off.<p>- Google translate support is horrendous. Chrome can real-time-translate a page, even a chat window as it&#x27;s scrolling, picks up live changes in the site and translate them. tl;dr google translate in Chrome is very good.<p>- Credit card management in Chrome seems for some reason to be more elegant, I&#x27;ve yet to manage to get it to work well in Brave.<p>All in all I&#x27;m much happier using Brave, it seems like a faster less bloated browser that doesn&#x27;t destroy my laptop, (and I feel less and less comfortable with google), so this is a good alternative for me, I don&#x27;t envisage going back any time soon.",
