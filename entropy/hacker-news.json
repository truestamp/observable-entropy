And last of our 4-5 project needed a complex authorization system.<p>So this time we wanted to build Authorization system as a product which you can customize the permissions, roles and policies. (And use again and again - We already have a Demo)<p>I have found several ways to handle authorization such as Zanzibar, OPA, Ory Keto etc... And I&#x27;m wondering what do you use yourself in your side projects or work?<p>What&#x27;s the benefits did you find your own way etc.?",
