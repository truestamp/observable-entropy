What can we all do to reduce and eliminate mass shootings?<p>Doesn&#x27;t it ever bother you that one of us or you could be next. Or your family member, your spouse&#x2F;parents&#x2F;kids&#x2F;friends&#x2F;neighbor could be next taking that bullet anywhere anytime in United States of America?<p>We all are focusing on making world a better place by serving best targeted advertisement or making best phone or best game or fastest delivery of goods and services or self driving cars or some software&#x2F;hardware. Or even biotech or cancer solution.<p>But, isn&#x27;t this need of time to solve gun violence ? \nCan we all with resources (money, influence, intellectual) do something? Why are we so helpless?\nWhy is Bill Gates, Elon Musks, Mark Benioff of this world are not doing anything visible and effective to fix this problem?<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are pro gun ownership or against gun ownership. Can we please come together and do something to eliminate or at least reduce mass shootings?<p>Please.",
