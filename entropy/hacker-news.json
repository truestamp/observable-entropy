      "text": "Hi HN. Just wanted to let everyone know that Weboob has been renamed to Woob. It looks like they&#x27;ve taken the rebranding seriously as even the individual applications have been renamed to something more sensible. E.g. the finance application was called Boobank, it has now been renamed to Woob Bank.<p>I think this is great. I hope this gets more people to use it and it becomes bigger.<p>New link for Woob is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;woob.tech&#x2F;",
