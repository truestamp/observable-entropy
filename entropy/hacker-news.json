      "text": "Hi Hacker News!<p>Throughout the summer, @paul_designs, @avi_dave, and I were creating Grey Software&#x27;s first public product: Focused Browsing. We would love for you to try it out!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grey.software&#x2F;focused-browsing<p>Like 200,000 other people, we used News Feed Eradicator (NFE) to control the detrimental effects of consuming feeds. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;news-feed-eradicator&#x2F;fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg<p>We loved the extension, but we had a few problems with it.<p>- It was tedious to toggle between focused and unfocused modes. You had to open the extension&#x27;s settings page, and click on the website that you want to enable&#x2F;disable.<p>- The codebase had gained bloat and complexity over the years. Things like using 2 Redux stores made it difficult to reason about the program flow, so we anticipated that adding new functionality like keyboard shortcuts and blocking promoted posts would be tricky.<p>Our extension recently went into Beta and we&#x27;re eager to hear everyone&#x27;s feedback and find any edge cases we haven&#x27;t covered. Thank You!",
