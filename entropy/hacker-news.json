      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;ve finally gotten a software developer job! I&#x27;ve changed careers from being a chemist, which was really draining me.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;ve been doing pretty much all my coding on Linux (Ubuntu -&gt; Pop_OS! -&gt; Fedora), but I run Windows 10 on another SSD as I game as well, and Linux is just no where near a quality user experience for gaming, at least the kind of games I play. Note I also have an NVIDIA GPU lol...<p>I&#x27;d like to not have to constantly switch OSes, so I was thinking to use WSL2 to install Fedora w&#x2F; no GUI, and just do all my dev stuff through the command line, which I&#x27;ve gotten more familiar with lately. I do my editing using Neovim already, so that should be fine.<p>Has anyone on HN done something similar, and what has been your experience? Once I get a laptop in a few months to a year (hopefully a Framework laptop!), I&#x27;ll use Fedora on there as well.<p>There&#x27;s also a part of me that very much dislikes contributing to Microsoft&#x27;s push to pull Linux users over, but at the end of the day I just need to get shit done :|",
