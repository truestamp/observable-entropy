      "text": "Hi,I&#x27;m a software developer at an e-commerce company and we are interested in exploring the EDI side of the business.<p>There seems to be a lack of up to date tools and libraries that help you build something from scratch and it&#x27;s no easy task to tackle for a small team. The most promising avenue of developing our own product might be from using Stedi and the tools that they offer to their customers.<p>The reason I&#x27;m writing this is to ask about your experience with Stedi or other alternatives. How easy is it to integrate? Did it satisfy your needs? Is it worth the money?Any feedback from a developer or from a company that used their toolset is very valuable.",
