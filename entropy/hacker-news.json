      "text": "I want to share my newest Android app with everyone on HN.  CraftBox allows you to easily run a Minecraft server on your Android device.  It is published in the Play Store, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=tech.ula.craftbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=tech.ula.craft...</a> , and posted on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CypherpunkArmory&#x2F;CraftBox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CypherpunkArmory&#x2F;CraftBox</a><p>I know I am late to the Minecraft scene.  I am a bit old to have been part of the original craze, but I now have a son who loves the game.  Now that I have played it with him, I can see the appeal.<p>I am an open source developer and the creator of UserLAnd, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=tech.ula\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=tech.ula</a>, so when I get excited about something, I am always thinking about how I can get involved and contribute to the community.  I read an article on how to run a Minecraft Server on your phone, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;run-minecraft-server-android&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;run-minecraft-server-android&#x2F;</a> , but I figured I could do better by not making people go through as many steps. So, that is a goal... make this simple.<p>This is the first public release and there are many things that can be improved.  You can see some of the issues I am going to be fixing soon in the GitHub issues.<p>Anyway, please check it out and tell me what you think.<p>Thanks!\nCorbin",
