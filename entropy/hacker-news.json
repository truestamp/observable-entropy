      "text": "I am based in Pakistan and currently working remotely full-time as a frontend developer. I want to move abroad, so from the past few months I have been actively started applying for companies in Germany in hopes to get hired.<p>I feel that interviewing is a very had process. First I have to put a lot of time to find an appropriate position, do research on the company and their culture and then apply for the position. After applying, I found the response rate to be very low. Around 5%-10% companies decide to start a screening call.<p>Next week, I have technical interviews with two German companies and I have to prepare for that alongside putting 8-10 hours everyday for my full-time job. I usually don&#x27;t find the energy or will for interview preparation during weekdays and if an interview comes, I make sure it is scheduled in the next week so that I can prepare on weekends.<p>Those who have been through the same experience, how many jobs interviews do you think one should have in the pipeline at the same time so to not get overwhelmed?",
