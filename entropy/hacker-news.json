      "text": "I am a mechanical engineer by training. But a software developer of many years. The majority of the work I have done has been in the bridge space where real world gadgets and software meet. I have worked with companies that have tangible products with all of the manufacturing and engineering discipline that goes along with then. Invariably, these companies want to treat software efforts the same as they do the rest of their engineering disciplines. Why wouldn&#x27;t they? After all, we call ourselves engineers too.<p>I have looked far and wide for analogs to help them understand what&#x27;s different. I have often seen the collaborative production that goes into movie production as similar to that of software development. We tell stories. There&#x27;s creativity. Rewrites. Lots of mundane behind the scenes work. Those individuals that make or break the execution of the effort. The problem with movie production, is that once the movie is done, it&#x27;s done. Which is similar to actual mechanical widget production. The product evolves very little once it&#x27;s &quot;published.&quot;<p>Stage production is similar to the movie making model. But you have to expend ongoing work to keep the production alive. Sure, there&#x27;s an up front investment that is more creative in nature to producing the opening night show. But even after the show touches down, you have to continue to be creative to keep it running. You have to pay the ongoing bills. Deal with different actors who come and go. Changing social issues mean tuning the play to keep it fresh and relevant. Does this work as a metaphor?",
