I&#x27;ve seen quite a bit of circumstantial evidence for this over the last period but what I&#x27;d love to see is some hard proof. If there is anybody who has worked on the offensive side of such an operation I&#x27;d love to see a leak of the playbook that goes with attacking a website like Hacker News, what strategies are in play, how accounts are used to re-inforce each other and so on.<p>Any takers?",
