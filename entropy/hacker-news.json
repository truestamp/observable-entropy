      "text": "The idea of time blocking or time chunking is simple. It essentially boils down to blocking some period on your calendar to do a particular task. For example, if you are interested in photography, you can block off 2 hours on every Sunday (bi-weekly) for photography.<p>Upon successful implementation, you might notice relief from that constant feeling of not having time for your hobby or doing something you are interested. It&#x27;s because now you have guaranteed time. It&#x27;s like a time-insurance thing! You can increase or decrease the time according to your need. Having this insurance relieves a lot of negative feelings about not being productive or not being able to do things you are interested in.<p>Give it a try!",
