      "text": "I saw news about those cartop ad companies like Firefly, Halo by Lyft, and Uber OOH. Those are for taxi&#x2F;ridesharing vehicles only. Is there any regulation&#x2F;legal reason so they are not doing this for non-ridesharing vehicles? I feel the places I visit most are schools, grocery stores, shopping center&#x2F;mall, outdoor parks, in which are mostly residence&#x2F;personal vehicles other than taxi&#x2F;ridesharing.",
