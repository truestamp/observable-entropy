      "text": "After more than a year of developing and iterating on a group of designers, we eventually started in an invite only launch beginning of the year.<p>Our challenge: Traditional design tools like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and co. are too complex and take a long time to learn. Other options like Canva are too basic for creators.<p>Our approach: Kittl is bridging this gap - empowering everyone to create stunning designs, without experience in  graphic design or additional tools.<p>We are a small group of people that actually got to know each other here on HN. \nIt would be great to hear your feedback: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;kittl<p>Thanks and happy to chat about it.",
