      "text": "We are developing a system to help designers visualize their digital works in different arrangements and&#x2F;or patterns to quickly brainstorm other ideas. Our system is based on existing research papers, where the author has done a great job explaining the principles behind their work.<p>The system breaks down graphical design principles into mathematical formulas, which are used to evaluate the designs&#x27; energy function. Using the Nonlinear Inverse Optimization algorithm, the parameters for the energy function for the designs are optimized to find its optimized version. This optimized function can model other designs that can be used to brainstorm other arrangements.<p>We have already developed the system to extract the parameters needed from a design and the functions required to evaluate those parameters to create the energy function for the design.\nWe need to optimize this system and develop the more interesting aspect of the system, i.e., optimizing the energy functions of these designs.<p>REQUIREMENTS\n- 2 or more years of experience developing libraries and&#x2F;or platform for enterprise products.\nExtensive knowledge of machine learning concepts like energy-based models, parallel tempering, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, etc.\n- Good understanding of mathematical concepts like sigmoid functions, differential equations, etc.\n- Currently, the system is developed in python, however, the developer can develop the system in any other language as well.\n- Great communication and collaboration skills.<p>Contact at contact@crio.digital",
