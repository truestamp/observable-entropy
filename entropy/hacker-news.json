I haven&#x27;t created any logins with this address in many, many years.<p>Every few years I check to see if there is anything important there. Just recently I noticed some recruiter messages addressed to my new legal name.<p>How is it possible that this address became linked in any way to my identity, let alone my new name?<p>I really want to reply to the messages with incredulity, and now it makes those companies seem scummy to use such recruitment practices.",
