Such as:<p>- Product will be open-source after achieving N active users\n- Product will be open-source after achieving N in revenue<p>I think this would be extremely valuable for startups, especially in competitive&#x2F;commoditized markets, who want to be open-source but also are too small to enforce their license on bad actors. I&#x27;m thinking of GPL, AGPL, but also other more restrictive licenses like BSL.<p>(I believe I have seen &quot;after 36 months&quot; type of pledges before, though can&#x27;t remember where.)",
