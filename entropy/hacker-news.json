      "text": "I lead a small team building web apps, but we currently have very little structure around code review. I want to get the right balance of process and tooling, but it would be interesting to learn what a healthy code review process looks like in other teams&#x2F;orgs.<p>So, what works well for your team? (And what doesn&#x27;t?)<p>Do you run the code that you are reviewing? Is it deployed somewhere automatically (if relevant)?<p>For change requests or bug reports, do you share repro steps? What does this look like? Screenshots, videos, something else?<p>Is there any sort of acceptance testing before code is merged?<p>I&#x27;m wondering how much process is helpful and ensures quality before it becomes onerous.",
