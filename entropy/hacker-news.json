It was tough, but the joy in the kids eyes made it all worth while.<p>Again this year we are going to be going virtual.  I do not like it, but it is the only practical solution given the new variant.<p>I realize there is a whole community out there that has not had this opportunity, so I ask you: What would you like or need this year?",
