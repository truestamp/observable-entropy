      "text": "Hi HN, we are Deepak and Sama, co-founders of BoxyHQ (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boxyhq.com&#x2F;). BoxyHQ provides an open-source platform for developers to quickly integrate enterprise features into their software solutions. These include SAML Single Sign-On (SSO), Audit logs, with more to come :)<p>Every B2B startup faces a common challenge when it comes to selling into the Enterprise; they need to allocate time and resources to support all the requirements to make their offering enterprise-grade. Supporting these requirements is a significant undertaking for the engineering team, especially since they already have their hands full with the core product. We experienced this problem ourselves and that is why we built BoxyHQ, a platform to integrate enterprise features in any SaaS app with just a few lines of code.<p>The main difference with Auth0 and WorkOS is that BoxyHQ is being built on an open source ethos. Our focus is to be a developer-first security platform, putting developers at the centre of our holistic approach and help them close the gap between compliance and security.<p>Please let me know if you have any questions, you can also reach out to me at deepak@boxyhq.com",
