      "text": "I&#x27;m a self-taught coder, 27yo and I have experience as a solution engineer (talking and light coding) at FAANG.<p>I could possibly segway into SWE in this role (if not FAANG then a startup), but I feel like I&#x27;m missing a lot of the underpinning theory (mostly mathematical and algo).<p>I&#x27;m really excited by the classes when I read through the BSc CS structure, and needless to say it would help me fill those gaps. I have enough savings to dedicate serious time to it, but its not the only way for me to get a SWE role, it would be partly for the enjoyment.<p>For those of you who have done CS at ug, is it worth it (beyond career setup)? Is it enjoyable for someone who likes coding?<p>Edit: I&#x27;m in Germany so the cost side of the cost-benefit is essentially just living costs.",
