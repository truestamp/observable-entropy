(the basic react-native animated is limited to 60fps)\n- customisable using useAnimatedStyle\n- controllable from worklets, so you can start &#x2F; stop the activity indicator as a response to a gesture handler, and thus provide instant feedback<p>I look forward to your suggestions in the comments bellow",
