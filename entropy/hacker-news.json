      "text": "I was told in the past that Gandi.net was a privacy aware registrar. Here&#x27;s my experience with them:<p>I was trying to register a domain with a TLD that&#x27;s only available in a few registrars. Njal.la was too expensive, and I hadn&#x27;t heard much of Epik in the past, so after a bit of research I chose to sign up on Gandi and get things done as fast as possible.<p>As soon as I signed up I noticed there was no way to check if the domain being registered would come with whois privacy by default, which was a huge red flag for me as I don&#x27;t want any of my personal details exposed. This red flag was enough for me to keep looking for registrars, so I started looking for the &quot;delete my account&quot; button, only to find out after 2 hours that there wasn&#x27;t one.<p>I messaged them on their support email, from the email on which the account was registered, and they replied fairly quick asking me for a photo of my ID on top of all the personal data that I had already given them.<p>The account was also unverified. I imagine this can also mean that if somebody registers an account there with your email, you will need to send them a picture of your ID to get it removed, which in the end proves absolutely nothing because they could register it on somebody else&#x27;s name and just use your email for some reason. I really hope it&#x27;s not the case.<p>Sorry if the text is poorly structured or I have any grammar mistakes. English is not my first language. I just wanted to get this out there.",
