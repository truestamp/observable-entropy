      "text": "Hello again - I made a similar post not too long ago about taking car of yourself and got some good answers and advice, but I came up with another question!<p>I am finishing my bachelors in CS right now - about 6 months left. My schedule does not look heavy for my last couple quarters, but I do not like the schedule I have to follow in school. I don&#x27;t like being given somewhat boring assignments that don&#x27;t leave room for creativity. I want to make something cool and adds value to the world.<p>However, I lack the discipline to do anything long term. I don&#x27;t hit the gym consistently for a long enough time to see good results. I have always wanted to get on a solid daily routine. My energy levels are low during the day and the past 2 weeks have not been very productive. Online&#x2F;remote learning has shortened my attention span significantly.<p>I want to build something (building myself physcially, mentally, financially, building products and software) but I can&#x27;t stick to it long enough to make something valuable even though I enjoy it.<p>I would appreciate any resources or advice while I sort through this. I am not being too hard on myself - I am okay. I continually work on myself but discipline has by far been my biggest challenge for quite a few years.",
