It seems something that happens genre-wide but I don&#x27;t see it in other tv categories. Any idea why it&#x27;s so prevalent in animated shows like those?",

Apologies for the title, but it&#x27;s length is rather limited.<p>I&#x27;m asking, because I&#x27;ve seen the article about google&#x27;s simd based quicksort, and because I&#x27;ve actually thought about this recently.<p>I&#x27;ve neglected to pursue this problem, because I was thinking that there&#x27;s no point to it anymore. I was thinking that everything solved to best efficiency already anyway, so why bother?<p>Am I wrong? Is there still room for improving efficiency&#x2F;performance of at least some functions&#x2F;algorithms out there?<p>If so ... what should I tackle? To make this easier, just assume I can improve <i>literally anything, as long as there&#x27;s still room for it,</i> and throw the challenges&#x2F;problems at me! :D<p>Thank you!",
