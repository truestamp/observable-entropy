      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed a ton of crypto scams on YouTube recently, many of which are using the names of legitimate channels (like SpaceX), re-posting content from those channels and promoting scams – usually in the form of &quot;send me [Elon Musk, Jeff Bezoz, etc] BTC, and I&#x27;ll send you 2x back&quot;.<p>It seems reasonable to expect one or two of these to slip through the cracks now and then, but over the past few months, I&#x27;ve had YouTube &quot;recommend&quot; these to me, again and again, multiple times per day. I&#x27;ve often reported them as spam, only to have YouTube <i>recommend the exact same video to me a few minutes later</i>. I don&#x27;t know anyone who would fall for the scams in the videos, but they&#x27;ve become so common now that it&#x27;s getting <i>really</i> annoying.<p>You can&#x27;t tell me that they&#x27;re too difficult to distinguish from legitimate content. Any human being or half-decent algorithm would be able to catch these with no trouble at all (heck, I could write a couple of regular expressions that would do the trick and have 0 false positives), which leads me to wonder: why is YouTube promoting these videos? At this point, it feels like they must have some incentive <i>not</i> to shut them down, because it would require deliberate effort to have <i>any</i> form of spam control while also somehow letting these through.<p>Am I the only one noticing this?",
