      "text": "Whether it&#x27;s git or hg or p4... what do you wish your VCS could do differently? Do you feel constrained by size or scale? Do you wish it were less sluggish? More flexible or easy to use? Easier to customize for your team&#x27;s processes or workflows?<p>To give one example, I&#x27;ve worked at multiple companies where the codebase was split across many git repos, and the slew of repos made everything harder to coordinate, develop, and understand. Maybe this resonates with you -- or maybe you have other problems?<p>(Context: I build developer tools, including currently a VCS. Nothing is more compelling to me than the day-to-day struggles of a developer who just wants to ship their code, god damn it.)",
