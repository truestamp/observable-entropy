      "text": "Hi all,<p>Back when I was running a one-person SaaS company the one task I often neglected was writing and updating documentation.<p>I&#x27;ve recently been working on the documentation tool I wish I had back then - something that makes it quick and easy to create docs, as well as helps keep them up to date and improves discoverability.<p>I&#x27;ve got as far as a very simple proof of concept, so now I&#x27;d love to know if there&#x27;s anyone else who would be interested in a tool like this.<p>The link below is to a quick survey, which includes a demo video of the app working:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;aNiw1Wp5gejjqGPy9<p>Thanks,\nMatt",
