I understand the need to run some things on the server &amp; send them to the client but can&#x27;t understand how&#x2F;why you&#x27;d need a nodejs library that will provide some <i>frontend</i> functionalities. I sometimes work with &quot;web3&quot; libraries (don&#x27;t hate me) and it seems like I can&#x27;t do anything in vanilla js. How does it work ? How do frontend frameworks work ?<p>Example: \nIn the quickstart of web3-onboard [1], the first lines are used to import node modules (which can&#x27;t be done in the browser) and then awaits some user action (that presumably take place in the browser) ... in the same file ?!<p>[1] : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blocknative&#x2F;web3-onboard#quickstart<p>Thanks a lot",
