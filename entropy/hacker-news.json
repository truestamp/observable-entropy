      "text": "The current trend appears to be towards server-side rendering on the edge with thinner clients.<p>Think: React Server Components, Edge Workers, Next.js SSR, etc.<p>The goal being faster page load times, and a reduction in complexity by shifting data access server-side.<p>At the same time devices are becoming faster and more powerful, and internet speed is increasing.<p>This means, latency will be reduced allowing more responsive SSR experience, but at the same time, devices will be able to download, parse and execute JS bundles quicker. More RAM and storage also means more data&#x2F;code cached locally.<p>A client-focused future would be about mobile apps, installed web apps, offline&#x2F;local-first, syncing, moving more app logic locally. A server-focused future would be about pushing all logic to the edge with server components&#x2F;SSR and making clients thin.<p>The dilemma is that with increases in speed and capabilities, both seem to get better, but which approach will win out?",
