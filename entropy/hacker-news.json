      "text": "Hi, HN<p>I have just graduated college (computer science) in India and was planning to pursue a masters program in the US afterwards. I got into a top20 program but due to family reasons I took a deferral to fall 2022.<p>I had a really good score in the standardised tests, which I think is the reason I got in. I dont think I can get into a big company right now and dont want to work in a smaller one here.<p>I seek your guidance on how can I best utilise this year to get a good job after my masters, and what skills should I develop now that would help me in life in the long run as well.<p>Thanks!",
