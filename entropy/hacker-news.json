      "text": "Its common in our industry to get to tech interviews and expect to do white boarding exercises about binary tree and matrix operations. And while these can prove your academic proficiency, these are rarely the day to day skills that make a developer competent. I was told by a hiring manager once that their reasoning behind this is that &quot;if you know the CS fundamentals it would be easier to collaborate across teams&quot;.
