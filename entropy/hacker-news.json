      "text": "Hey HN,<p>My name is Melvin and I am currently working on an MVP for a web service called View, to make it easier for developers to upload, process, and deliver media in their apps.<p>The idea came to mind while I was working on a photo-sharing app and noticed first-hand how needlessly complex and expensive existing services are.<p>I wished someone would create an easy-to-use and affordable API&#x2F;SDK ala Stripe but for audio, video, and images.<p>Is this something that was a pain point for you? I&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences building apps with user-generated content.<p>Cheers",
