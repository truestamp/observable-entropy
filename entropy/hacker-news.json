      "text": "Hi!\nI&#x27;ve had a few programming jobs over the last 2&#x2F;3 years(mostly at startups, and also for one Fortune 500 company as a contractor), and I really struggle mentally, I can&#x27;t take the pressure of most regular programming jobs, the deadlines, the meetings, the hierarchy, the constant need to stay on top of new tech, it&#x27;s really burning me out.<p>I&#x27;m looking for something less stressful&#x2F;demanding, but still in tech.\nI&#x27;m OK with earning less, do you have any idea of what kind of jobs I could look for?\nThanks",
