      "text": "So I have a personal project which I pay like 10-20 bucks a month for. I am pretty sure I found a bug but apparently there is no way to log a support ticket unless you you sign for the 30 dollar monthly fee. My company also has gcp, azure, and aws. You can guess which service provides the worst support.<p>If you pay money for something they should have some support. I use GCP because the service I am connecting to is hosted in GCP which will lower my latency, but GCP support is so terrible.",
