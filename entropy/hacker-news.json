      "text": "Earlier this year I migrated each of my children&#x27;s Minecraft accounts to Microsoft accounts as Microsoft no longer allows launching Minecraft with a Minecraft account.<p>About a month after doing the migration while signing in to one of the Microsoft accounts I was presented with a message from Microsoft that the account was locked due to activity on the account that &#x27;violated their terms of service&#x27; despite no one using the account since the earlier migration.<p>The only way to unlock the account is to provide a phone number in order to receive a confirmation code. There is no email option provided to receive a confirmation code, and the only way to contact support directly is by signing in to the account (can&#x27;t be done while the account is locked).<p>Prior to the migration from Minecraft to Microsoft I never had any issues with using any of our Minecraft accounts.<p>Whoever at Microsoft thought this was a good idea is causing them to lose business.",
