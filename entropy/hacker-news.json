      "text": "I recently as stumbled upon this community on Reddit. If you&#x27;re not familiar they bill themselves as &quot;\nDiscussion regarding the potential collapse of global civilization, defined as a significant decrease in human population and&#x2F;or political&#x2F;economic&#x2F;social complexity over a considerable area, for an extended time.&quot;<p>I imagine there are many people who visit both that can provide context as well.<p>The general sentiment there seems to align roughly with the general mood I see across reddit and other social media among millennial&#x2F;genz crowd which is why I&#x27;m posting this, because it&#x27;s more than just one doom and gloom containment sub, it&#x27;s what I see a lot of people are feeling&#x2F;expecting due to changes we are observing, rational or not.<p>Now I&#x27;m not fully on board with thinking society is going to collapse but it does feel like things are growing unstable. It&#x27;s hard to recognize if this is just a symptom of being too-online or not.",
