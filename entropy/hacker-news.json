What motivates you to write and publish your writings online?<p>More context: I&#x27;ve noticed over time from submissions and comments that many people in our community enjoy writing and blogging. Recently, in an article that was trending about retiring early, the author said that now that he is &quot;financially independent&quot;, he plans to spend more time writing. I&#x27;m curious what non-monetary reasons people have for spending their free time writing and publishing their writings online.",

I have been working as a contract SDET for a few years through a limited company and I want to start expanding. While I&#x27;ve worked across the stack in both SDET and general dev roles, I have found a niche in testing blockchain products that has gone pretty well and I&#x27;ve easily found my own work as and when I&#x27;ve needed it. What I don&#x27;t know is how to take that to the next level.<p>Has anyone taking the jump from contractor to agency owner? How did you go about it?",
