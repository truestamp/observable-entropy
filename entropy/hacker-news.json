      "text": "I speak French and English. I have localized my web app in these two languages. Now I&#x27;d like to add more languages.<p>I suppose that leveraging the two existing languages can help reduce ambiguity and improve the translation to a 3rd language?<p>Example:\n- the menu has &quot;Home&quot; as a first item, in English\n- in French, this item is translated as &quot;Accueil&quot; (literally, &#x27;welcome&#x27; in English) \n=&gt; together, these point to a precise meaning of the item, that should be close to &quot;Startseite&quot; in German, not the German term for &quot;Home&quot; nor &quot;Welcome&quot;.<p>Do you know of any translation service that would offer this feature?",
