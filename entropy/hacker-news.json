      "text": "I have a hobby of making prints with an inkjet printer and this requires me to make fine visual distinctions.  I necessarily do a lot of work in the evenings under artificial light.<p>The main light in the area is an RGB strip which is terrible when set for &quot;warm&quot; light (have a hard time telling which side of the paper is the bright side) and better when set for &quot;cool&quot; light.<p>I&#x27;m looking for an bulb with an ordinary socket to set in a gooseneck lamp on my desk to add supplementary light in a small area.  I don&#x27;t believe the &quot;color rendition index&quot; is meaningful,  don&#x27;t care much about energy efficiency, lifetime, or cost, and don&#x27;t want to buy a whole case.<p>Looking at the marketing on web sites for light bulbs I&#x27;m not even sure if the people who wrote the copy have eyes -- I haven&#x27;t seen any that convince me that their products are better than the others.<p>Any suggestions?",
