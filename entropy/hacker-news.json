In a &#x27;perfect&#x27; environment, would these systems sync with neural implants to replicate the experience of these activities or would new forms of mental stimulation exist in a Metaverse?<p>Or, rather, is it not a &#x27;virtual world&#x27; per-se, but rather an elaborate entertainment console within a confined personal environment as it is today with various entertainment options people can enjoy and portal into virtual environments as is presently the case on the Oculus Quest 2.<p>Regardless of the environment, will these virtual worlds be openly accessible on any device, like Android, or will they be vertically integrated like iOS?",
