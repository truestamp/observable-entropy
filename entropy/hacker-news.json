      "text": "The whole computer security field now seems completely gated. The plethora of industry certifications from self-appointed regulating bodies is so incredibly extensive.  A new one seems to pop up every week. I&#x27;m seeing job postings requiring 6+ certifications costing 1000&#x27;s each.<p>General computing jobs are subject to a very high amount of competition, 100&#x27;s of applicants to one position.  Naturally, succeeding in these certifications offers no guarantee of employment, but in fact having them has become the bare minimum and it seems highly unlikely that one would be employed regardless. How does one justify gambling 1000&#x27;s? Is there a better way?<p>Is this beneficial to anyone? Is this the future of computing jobs? Will we end up seeing this in other fields?",
