      "text": "I really loved computers and programming growing up - I guess many people here did - but I feel like my Bachelor&#x27;s degree in CS replaced that love with a &#x27;grind&#x27; mentality. It was all about ticking the institutional boxes correctly, and making sure I met the precise requirements in the grading rubric. I got good grades but I lost some sense of creativity and passion for the subject itself.<p>What&#x27;s more is that my degree wasn&#x27;t the most rigorous and in fact taught a couple of subjects pretty weakly. I saw community college courses that would have given me a better grounding in core subjects (eg data structures).<p>I have a few months free in which I&#x27;d like to do something that addresses these twin issues. Bonus points if it makes me more employable. I see other people&#x27;s resumes full of amazing looking side projects which are both technically challenging and look absorbing to work on, but the best ideas I have these days are the same cookie cutter full stack project ideas that you see around the internet.<p>I guess I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has faced this issue and&#x2F;or can suggest anything. I&#x27;m talking textbooks, project ideas, anything. Some things I&#x27;ve thought of:<p>* Invest in contributing to an open source project - not sure how to pick the right one though\n* Work through nand2tetris - unfortunately looks like a lot of overlap with my Architecture course, but especially the later projects look cool, and it&#x27;s almost universally praised for being interesting\n* Pick a textbook&#x2F;topic from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teachyourselfcs.com&#x2F; to work through - so much analysis paralysis here though\n* Write my own versions of some lower level tools using C&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Java - something like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danistefanovic&#x2F;build-your-own-x - I enjoyed the classic &#x27;write your own shell in C&#x27; assignment, but again seems fairly uninspired",
