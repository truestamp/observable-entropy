      "text": "There are many apps on Mac and Windows based on Qt, as well as ones built using the native SDKs exposed by respective platforms, like Cocoa and Dot Net. Are the ones built on Qt as smooth and performant as the native ones? Or will there be clear performance differences? There are questions like this on StackExchange, but they are more than a decade old, I am interested in knowing the current status!<p>On that note, how will an OS built around Qt perform compared to say iOS or Android, like Ubuntu Touch (assuming similar levels of underlying hardware)? Will Android and iOS and the apps on top of them will be naturally smoother, scrolls and app transitions being smoother than in Ubuntu Touch? Or is it that the Qt coding can be suitably tweaked in Ubuntu Touch to match iOS and Android performances?",
