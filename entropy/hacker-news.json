Bonus points for open-source&#x2F;self-hosting.<p>Background: after experiencing how far site builders have come, I&#x27;m trying to embrace low&#x2F;no code into my prototypes. What I like about that:<p>- better ownership by the non-devs&#x2F;less dependence<p>- reduce feedback cycles &#x2F; let people make simple changes on their own &lt;&gt; lets devs&#x2F;POs focus on harder problems",
