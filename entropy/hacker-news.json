      "text": "Hey HN - I sold my company earlier this year and I&#x27;ve been thinking about what I want to do next. Founders with a following on Twitter can bounce ideas off that group and get early adopters, so I wanted to grow my Twitter account. I follow [Daniel Vassallo](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dvassallo) (grew to 70k+ followers) and he suggests replying to big accounts when they tweet. Twitter has notifications you can turn on to get notified when people Tweet, but there are a few problems:<p>1. They notify you for all sorts of other things I didn&#x27;t care about<p>2. You have to turn the notifications on&#x2F;off for every account<p>3. I wanted to reply to Tweets without opening Twitter to reduce distractions<p>Here&#x27;s the solution, I&#x27;m calling it *[Wax](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wax.run&#x2F;twitter)*:<p>1. [Sign up](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wax.run&#x2F;twitter) and add a Twitter list that fits your niche. You can find one on [Listr](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listr.pro&#x2F;) or try [this one](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;i&#x2F;lists&#x2F;1433539932530909184).<p>2. We send you an email or SMS when someone on the List tweets<p>3. Reply to the email and we&#x27;ll post the Tweet immediately<p>I&#x27;ve grown my personal account 20% and doubled impressions since I started using it last week. I&#x27;m starting from a very small base (~150 followers), but it seems to be working!",
