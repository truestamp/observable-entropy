      "text": "Been building something that will hopefully be useful to the community and Gmail users in general - would love to get any feedback &#x2F; thoughts!<p>So my Gmail inbox used to be a mess, especially after I signed up for a few newsletters. I tried creating filters by using &quot;Filter messages like these&quot;, but I ended up with 50 rules that could be condensed to ~20. It was also difficult to get a good overview of what all the different rules are doing.<p>So a friend and I built a website called SortEm to help us out.<p>Check out some the rules we added in this link and apply them to your inbox if you find them useful!<p>The 10 rules in the link are for stuff like:<p>Marking large emails with the label &quot;&gt;10MB&quot;<p>Marking emails from eBay and Amazon with &quot;e-com&quot; labels<p>Marking emails with keywords of newsletters and promotions as &quot;Newsletter | Promotion&quot; and making them skip the inbox<p>Marking emails with keywords of security notifications as &quot;Security notification&quot; and making sure they are in Primary<p>Marking emails from sites like GitHub, Reddit<p>etc.<p>BTW: In SortEm you can also upload a Gmail filter file, edit the different filters, add some useful filters that we collected from friends and from our own inboxes, and apply them all to your own Gmail. Also, you can create a unique link that will save your rules.<p>Would love to hear what you guys think, and feel free to spread the word! :)",
