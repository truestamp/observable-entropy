      "text": "Many people left the City to live in places with more space given the remote first world that COVID created.<p>But at some point, COVID will end, or at the very least, the restrictions around it will, and SF Companies will be planning their next moves.<p>SF was the epicenter of Tech, and the pandemic encouraged high skill tech workers to move to other cities, which helps bolster their own tech scene.<p>But! Maybe tech companies call back their formerly remote workers. Maybe they spent too much on their campuses, maybe the future isnt full remote but rather hybrid in office some days and remote others.<p>What is your thesis about the SF Housing Market?<p>Will it recover?<p>Or are the high prices we&#x27;re so used to a thing of the past?<p>Or! permanent stagnation?",
