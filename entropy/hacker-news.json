      "text": "Seeing the latest post on the frontpage [1] and the comments, tells me I&#x27;m not the only one totally in awe of the marvel, that is the James Web Space Telescope.<p>Some time ago, SmarterEveryDay made a video [2] about how his father worked on the sunshield. His job, as a metrologist, was to measure and verify the shape of the sunshield.<p>It made me realize, there must be 1000+ of people who did fascinating and unusual and probably invisible work on JWST.. but don&#x27;t have someone with a few million subscribers to share their stories.<p>Since HN attracts engineers, scientists, programmers and more.. I&#x27;m sure there will be people on here who in some capacity worked on JWST. Be it directly, or a supplier etc.<p>So, tell me your stories. What unique, interesting, invisible thing have you worked on, how was it, what challenges did you face, did it result in some unique solutions? How excited are you?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31072590\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Pu97IiO_yDI",
