      "text": "I&#x27;m in a weird situation. I&#x27;m a &quot;freelance developer&quot; with 1 client. That client is currently more than 12 months and $250k behind on payroll.  They are presently on both on the verge of bankruptcy and projecting that an update I&#x27;m supposed to deliver tomorrow will generate 10M in revenue in the next year with silly growth beyond that.  While their long term projections are a bit doubtful their short term projections are based on their customers&#x27; verifiable infrastructure commitments which are between 10x and 100x of the projected revenue.<p>I&#x27;m under intense pressure to deliver the update with the idea that it will enable them to generate enough money to pay off their debt, but this seems fundamentally wrong to me.  Is there some other deal that we could work out quickly that would be fair to both parties and something that their board might agree to?",

      "text": "I dropped out of my math PhD program at the start of 2021 and have spent the last few months learning statistics and how to program. I have always enjoyed competitive math so I really loved leetcode&#x2F;Project Euler and have done a few hundred problems between them. But I have no real programming experience.<p>During my undergrad summers I did &quot;REU&#x27;s&quot; (essentially math internships) and I went to grad school directly after graduating, so I have no experience in anything but pure math. I fear the longer I stay unemployed the less attractive I would be to an employer.<p>I was wondering: \n1) What type of jobs (in tech) may be welcoming to someone with my skillset? (that is which can I apply to without learning too much more at this point).\n2) If there is generally more I should know before I can apply to most jobs?\n3) I have not yet applied to any jobs but I was wondering if I should click &quot;new grad&quot; or &quot;professional&quot; since I am neither.<p>Currently I am thinking of SWE jobs, but I am happy to learn of any other suggestions.<p>Cheers,\nn-Dim.",
