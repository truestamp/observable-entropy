      "text": "I&#x27;m suffering from a really bad problem where the text on my M1Pro Mac is blurry when connected to any external display.24&quot; 1080p monitors look blurry, and 1440 27&quot; monitors also look blurry.<p>This is particularly obvious when comparing the text quality of Windows to Mac side by side. For reference I&#x27;ve attached an image taken on a 1440p 27&quot; screen running Windows inside a VM. The text quality of Windows is vastly clearer. [1]<p>In VSCode it is absolutely atrocious despite looking great on Windows on the same display. [2]<p>I&#x27;m at my wits end and have tried everything from running dummy displays with BetterDummy to messing around with DisplayLink adaptors to try and figure out what&#x27;s wrong.<p>Does anyone else have this issue or a solution? Is a new monitor the only solution? If so which monitors don&#x27;t produce this blurriness?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;cxQDMGT.png\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;xvryQUp.png",
