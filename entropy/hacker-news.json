The vast majority of my B2C customers are on my monthly plan, and only a small percent are on my annual plan, which is discounted.<p>What should I be thinking about when considering the annual discount? Is there a &#x27;right&#x27; number that I should be targeting?<p>So far, I&#x27;ve considered that the fees I pay are lower for annual customers, and the risk of mid-year churn is somewhat lower. Are there other relevant considerations?<p>I understand why new customers would sign up for a monthly plan, to try it out (there&#x27;s also a 2-week free trial, before having to pay). Should I be contacting customers who are still with me after a couple months and encouraging them to switch to annual subscriptions? Or should I not really care?",
