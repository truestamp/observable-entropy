I read a lot about people transitioning from regular tech&#x2F;programming jobs to maybe quants&#x2F;finances etc., but rarely about arts (literature, music, sociology, history etc.).<p>I got into a CS curriculum right after finishing my high school on a whim; I&#x27;d always wanted to pursue a career in literature&#x2F;writing&#x2F;journalism from a younger age (but couldn&#x27;t due to personal reasons). Now that I&#x27;m almost 27 and have been in the industry for ~5 years now, I&#x27;m wondering if I should decide on taking the plunge, or at least plan for it... since I do feel the friction in transitioning getting a bit higher as I spend more time in this field.",
