      "text": "Is the UX research discipline just hype? \nIt seems that the tech community accepts certain dogma to realease products &quot;MVP, agile, user centered design, etc&quot;.<p>Yet if there was a good process, why does the tech industry follow UX principles that keep pumping mainly low quality products, while Apple is the opposite?<p>Apple&#x27;s secrecy does not help. The few articles on google were either outdated (Job&#x27;s legacy) or blog opinions and speculations. The few UX researchers on Linkedin were Apple contractors, with some roles opening recently in Austin.<p>What are they doing right that most tech companies miss? Or is it not design, but a distinctive leadership and strategy that works?<p>Ex: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=o3uR6IDSHSM<p>Would love to hear from insiders if possible, thanks.",
