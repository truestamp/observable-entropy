      "text": "Hi HN ! I would like to build a shell syntax parser and I would like to do it without yacc or tools like that, for learning purposes. I have been reading a lot parsing tutorials and I got a tokenizer working. From what I have read I now either have to make a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree out of my tokens with the help of a grammar from this page [1]<p>Now can you point me to any good documentation on how to make a tree out of it ?<p>All the tutorials I could find on the matter are made for arithmetic syntax and somehow I haven&#x27;t been able to adapt those to my use case.<p>I have also read article from the creator of Oil shell and talks about how making a modal tokenizer would make sense for the shell syntax but I have not been able to find anything on how to build such a thing. Have ever done one ?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;onlinepubs&#x2F;9699919799.2018edition&#x2F;utilities&#x2F;V3_chap02.html#tag_18_10",
