      "text": "Ledger [1] is a tool that reminds you via slack to terminate your EC2 instances (works with GCP as well).<p>I&#x27;ve built this last year. It didn&#x27;t get any traction and I&#x27;ve recently decided to shut it down. I wrote a twitter thread [2] about it explaining why and listed some of the mistakes I made. And boy there were plenty (some of them I didn&#x27;t even mention...like how the name is totally wrong XD).<p>I got a suggestion in the twitter thread that I should post it here and see if I can get any more feedback. Might as well get some more knowledge out of this failure, right?<p>It was also suggested by a couple of folks that I list the project on sites like microaquire and indiemaker but I don&#x27;t know how realistic this is?! I mean why would anyone want to to buy a SaaS with zero users?!<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ledger.initeq.net&#x2F;<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;denibertovic&#x2F;status&#x2F;1466408868276314114",
