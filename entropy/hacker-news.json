      "text": "Serious question.  Family close to me has been diagnosed with epilepsy due to Absence Seizures [1].  The more I learn about it, the more I&#x27;m like &quot;snap&quot; that&#x27;s what I go through myself when I am working out the logic to a problem I&#x27;m coding.  Maybe I&#x27;m just projecting and making everything about me.  I do understand that some epilepsy syndromes can be familial.  When I was younger it was like &quot;look he&#x27;s spaced out&quot;.  And someone would chime in &quot;no he&#x27;s processing&quot;.  Is this just me (and my family)?  Or is it more widespread?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epilepsy.com&#x2F;what-is-epilepsy&#x2F;seizure-types&#x2F;absence-seizures",

      "text": "I was filling out a rental application on on-site.com and a modal popped up telling me I had been texted a link and had 5 minutes to resend the link. I got a text from 32858 and it was of the form https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.equifax.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;secure-mfa&#x2F;v2&#x2F;authentications&#x2F;verification-tokens&#x2F;&lt;long hexstring&gt;&#x2F;verify. I clicked on it and it took me to a page that just had the text, &quot;Authentication completed. Return to your application,&quot; or something like that. I don&#x27;t remember what the domain was.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find anything online about this, so I&#x27;m wondering, is this legit? Or is this somehow an elaborate ploy to steal my identity? What&#x27;s also weird is that the website didn&#x27;t change after I clicked on the link, but at some point I saw a back button on the page which closed the modal, and now I&#x27;m wondering if that button was there the whole time. Also, if I tap on the link again, I get redirected to secureauth.io&#x2F;expired, but I can find no information about that domain online. My co-applicant never had the modal pop up and never got a text.",
