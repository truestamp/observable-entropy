This person has been helping for about 4 months now but we decided to end our relationship because there&#x27;s a lack of experience so we are spending too much time reviewing and fixing.<p>Minutes later, Mailchimp alerts us that our keys have been published publicly on Github, and we find a copy of all our propietary code just published on someone&#x27;s account.<p>We know this person is from a big consulting firm in india (aprox. 250 developers).<p>We immediately informed the manager of the firm and minutes later the repo was deleted, but haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to talk more to them (it&#x27;s too late in India now).<p>What would you do in this situation?<p>I  know that what they did is illegal (sharing propietary code from a private repository to the world). Is there any real way to compensate for what they did, or should I just assume they can do this without repercussion with every client they have? Things that come to mind:<p>- Reporting their github accounts<p>- Report their contractor accounts in different websites (UpWork etc)",
