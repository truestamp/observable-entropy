      "text": "About a year ago I started putting tax money into a tax account throughout the year, to avoid any surprises come tax season. This has greatly reduced my stress level when I needed to prepare and pay tax. I&#x27;d like to continue doing that.<p>However, one problem is I need to figure out what my tax liability is, and how much I&#x27;ve paid&#x2F;reserved, up to the current date of the tax year. Since I do my own accounting, all I&#x27;m missing right now is plugging in the numbers into form 1040, and get a number out. Ideally I can automate this process so I don&#x27;t have to fill the form twice every month. I can probably write a program or create a spreadsheet, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s an existing solution already.",
