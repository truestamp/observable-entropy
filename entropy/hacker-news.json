The role&#x2F;level has its obvious perks (recognition&#x2F;influence&#x2F;very well compensated&#x2F;etc.).<p>However, I feel some fatigue&#x2F;burnout from leadership responsibilities. I have been burnt before and know what an ugly place it is.<p>What are your advice to help bring back some balance? I have considered:<p>* Taking a long break (up to 6 months).<p>* Moving down to a senior role and just chill (not exactly sustainable long term if we still want private school for the kids).<p>I wonder if there are other career paths that may be suitable medium&#x2F;long term. If so, please enlighten me.",
