      "text": "Hi HN,<p>For the last couple of weeks, I&#x27;m developing this website called <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quickhighprotein.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quickhighprotein.com</a><p>Because I like fitness, I thought it would be a fun project to create a high-protein recipes directory website. Where we can find easy-to-cook high protein recipes, which take less than 15mins.<p>On this website, people can save vegan, snacks, veg, and non-veg recipes. It&#x27;s a community-based project. It will be very helpful to newcomers in the fitness industry just like me to find easy and simple protein-based recipes.<p>I just need some feedback about this. And, if you guys add some high protein recipes, that would be very helpful. Also, i have more features to add but, I&#x27;ll do it later. If people like this idea.<p>Hopefully, It will help everyone across the world.<p>Waiting for your kind feedback. And, thanks in advance.<p>Shazeb",
