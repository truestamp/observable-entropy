      "text": "Abstract: Compared to medical treatment, software consulting remains a rudimentary activity lacking standardized practices with predictable outcomes. I will present introductory concepts of Human Pathology to show how software developers and consultants can learn from them. Additionally, I will propose a methodology for applying these concepts to evaluate, diagnose and improve software projects. Finally, I’ll share some reflections of the actions needed to be taken by the software guild to adopt the scientific method in our daily practice.<p>Friends Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;santiagoq.medium.com&#x2F;principles-of-software-pathology-d40027b2f241?sk=7f3da9cfd88497bc452593acccf5d24a",
