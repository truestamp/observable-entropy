      "text": "I haven&#x27;t read foundation in decades. Did Gaal have this prime counting habit in the books too? I used to count primes many many years ago but I couldn&#x27;t after a while. Then I&#x27;d simply add the digits of any number I see to check if its a prime. I was very disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t keep up the recitation game with large primes.<p>Watching the series, I wonder if I picked up the game from the foundation books. I honestly can&#x27;t recall now. She goes up to 80 something million in the TV series!",
