      "text": "I&#x27;m in the last stage of an interview and they have handed me over an offer later where it states that I can work remotely but on certain occasions I will have to travel to the office. These occasions are: important company-wide announcements, team events, roadmap events. They cannot predict how often these events will happen, but they say it could be roughly once per quarter.<p>I have asked them many times about their remote work policy and they honestly say that they are not 100% sure how it will turn out in the future. Right now they are 100% remote, but they cannot assure me it will stay as such in the future. It may be that for people who live in a city where they have offices, then an hybrid model may be applied (I don&#x27;t live in a city where they have an office).<p>I understand that they cannot guarantee me anything regarding the future if they actually don&#x27;t know (many companies are still figuring this whole WFH situation out).<p>My gut feelings tell me: don&#x27;t accept if 100% remote is not guaranteed... but somehow I think I&#x27;m being too pessimistic (the people I have interviewed with are normal and nice, no red flags. Also the project looks interesting). Any opinions?",
