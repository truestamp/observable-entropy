It feels like recently everything Microsoft has done with it has been a step backwards, from trying to force me to create a Microsoft account when I first log in, to trying to sell me One Drive at every turn, to just plain bad UI design &amp; implementation.<p>That being said I don&#x27;t want to buy a mac, I like having the power to control what hardware is in my PC. I like being able to choose between hundreds of different laptops to find the right price point to hardware power.<p>Is anyone working on a new premium operating system that could be a serious competitor to Windows?",
