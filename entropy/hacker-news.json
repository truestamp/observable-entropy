      "text": "Hello HN!<p>I&#x27;m new to Reddit (always had an unjustified bad opinion about this social network). I&#x27;ve started writing more articles on Medium and trying to get more views&#x2F;followers by posting them to the relevant sub-reddits.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t understand how the notation system works. Every time I hit refresh the number of upvote changed. Even if I hit refresh every half second.<p>Are there just so many people that downvote and upvote (almost 10s of downvotes AND upvotes per second??) or is that a dark pattern to make you believe there is something happening?",
