For a long time, I have been considering emigrating via the computer science masters route.<p>I have never been to Canada or USA and between them where do you think it would be more sensible to emigrate to?<p>With the assumption that the quality of education would be mostly similar, here&#x27;s a gist of the comparison.<p>- Canada offers an easier path to PR and then Citizenship. I also have friends there.<p>- USA offers more and high paying SWE jobs and the duration of a MS course can be 1 to 1.5yr which would mean I wouldn&#x27;t have to take a big education loan.<p>However, OPT only guarantees 3 years of life in states. H1B is a lottery. Green card is not possible.",
