      "text": "Hello HN,<p>My team is waiting to get into the Startup School founder match, so in the meantime we thought we&#x27;d post here.<p>We currently run a bootstrapped business that generates $2m per year and we want to launch our first hardware venture. I&#x27;m curious if there are any electrical or mechanical engineers in the Los Angeles area?<p>The product is a life-sized 3d-printer like device that will be used in the health and beauty space. We are looking to put together the team, finance the MVP while raising angel funds.<p>Please comment if you&#x27;re interested or email me (address in my profile) Thank you!",
