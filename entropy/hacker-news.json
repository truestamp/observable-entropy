      "text": "We are constantly bothered by buying departments doing what they think is &quot;due diligence&quot; by asking a tonne of abstract open-ended questions about security with no context, like,<p>&quot;How do you manage security keys?&quot;<p>&quot;What encryption do you use?&quot;<p>Unless you are self-employed, they are massive questions full of nuance and probably have 50 different answers on 50 different systems but these companies believe they have the right to ask.<p>I know we can use a Security-as-a-service company to answer these on our behalf but I wondered what more established companies do? Do you just say, &quot;here is the standard security page and that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re getting&quot;, or do you also spend many hours answering &quot;what backups do you take?&quot;",
