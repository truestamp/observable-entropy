They are working fine. However they are starting to show age.<p>Im employing some new employees soon, and was thinking of getting the Apple Silicon machines. However before I commit to that, wanted to know what challenges or issues I should be considering or being aware of when having a team that would essentially have two different architecture setups.<p>We do primarily web development and also do react native mobile apps.<p>We also have just migrated our core platform from .NET Framework to .NET Core.<p>We utilise docker too.",
