      "text": "A few years ago, I signed a contract withA a German company and proceeded to request a work visa. The visa was denied on the grounds that I did not have a college degree at the time. My salary was going to be &gt;55k and I was told that, as a programmer, I wouldn&#x27;t need a degree and would be fast tracked.<p>Fast forward a few years, I got my degree and accepted another job with a &gt;65k salary. Again, I requested the work visa. Again, it was rejected. This time on the grounds that I didn&#x27;t submit proof that I was at B1 level in... English. Yes, that&#x27;s right. English. I don&#x27;t know if I have the energy to appeal this nonsense.<p>What&#x27;s been your experience getting a work visa for Germany?",
