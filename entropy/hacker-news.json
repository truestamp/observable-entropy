      "text": "Earlier today I noticed a few songs had been added to a playlist of mine...with a bunch of &quot;songs&quot; by this artist: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;artist&#x2F;68mk8GNhUjTLMw72RCBIvV<p>With a little exploration you run into an endless supply of bots, all with &gt;1,000,000 active monthly listeners. At first I was pissed someone could not only randomly find my playlist and randomly add songs, but now I&#x27;m just wondering how it&#x27;s possible for a service as able as Spotify to be filled with so much spam? Has anyone else experienced something Similar?",
