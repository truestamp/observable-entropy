      "text": "Hi HN, I made Chrome&#x2F;Firefox&#x2F;Edge extension that calculates your (potential) mortgage repayments while browsing listings on Zillow&#x2F;Trulia&#x2F;Realestate.com.au&#x2F;Domain.com.au<p>The Firefox extension can be found here:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;sv-SE&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;real-estate-buddy&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;sv-SE&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;real-estate-b...</a><p>I realize most people go to their banks first to get a pre-approval and see how much they can borrow and afford but not everyone is like that.<p>Personally, a big number such as $500000 or $700000 doesn&#x27;t really speak to me. However if I see something like $634&#x2F;wk then I can clearly see if I can afford a certain property or not.<p>Sometimes I like to browse real estate websites and see how much a particular home would cost me on a weekly&#x2F;bi-weekly&#x2F;monthly basis.<p>Most real estate websites allow you to simulate your repayments but it&#x27;s a manual process and I really wanted to be able to browse while seeing the potential loan repayments.<p>For the Australian users out there, there are often prices missing on the listings of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;domain.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;domain.com.au</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realestate.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;realestate.com.au</a> , in this case I use the marketing range that the websites expose to calculate the repayments.<p>The extension also tries to highlight which property would be ideal for you based on your deposit and loan interest rate.<p>The extension stores your data on local storage so nothing is ever sent or stored anywhere else. No need to sign up or create an account either. No analytics whatsoever.<p>I hope you enjoy it and any feedback is welcome.",
