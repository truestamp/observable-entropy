He&#x27;s ex-facebook and is looking to keep his skills sharp while looking for the next gig. Over four weeks, They’ll work with various technologies including reactjs and nodejs, so feel free to join them if you’re interested in the topic.<p>I’ve joined previous cohorts and found it motivating to complete projects with a group in the past, it’s especially useful when you get stuck. Plus, it’s free! If you’re interested, you’ll find the cohort here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildfaast.com&#x2F;#service under the name `Amazon Clone (Intermediate&#x2F;Advanced)`",
