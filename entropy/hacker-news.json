      "text": "Hi HN!<p>Niels here. I&#x27;m the creator of UnionML, a Python MLOps framework that removes the boilerplate and friction associated with building and deploying machine learning systems to production.<p>I&#x27;ve been training and deploying models for almost a decade now, and one pain-point I&#x27;ve consistently had is managing the complexity of building and maintaining an ML stack that works for the entire model development lifecycle - from prototyping to production.<p>UnionML is built on top of Flyte (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flyte.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flyte.org</a>) and exposes a functional interface for defining the building blocks of your ML application via decorators -- think Flask or FastAPI method endpoints -- and UnionML takes care of bundling them into microservices for different use cases such as:<p>- model training\n- batch prediction\n- online prediction\n- (more coming soon!)<p>This project aims to unify the rich ecosystem of data, ML, and MLOps tools that have emerged over the last decade or so (e.g. MLFlow, Sagemaker, Spark, etc.)  to provide a nice UX for model developers, in both individual and team settings.<p>It&#x27;s very early days for this project, so if you&#x27;re interested in getting involved or learning more, you can go to the:<p>- Docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unionml.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unionml.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;</a>\n- Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unionai-oss&#x2F;unionml\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unionai-oss&#x2F;unionml</a>\n- Slack: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flyte-org.slack.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;C03JL38L65V\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flyte-org.slack.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;C03JL38L65V</a>",
