      "text": "There is a quote attributed to Gauss (or Abel?) which goes: <i>When asked about how he made his great discoveries, answered; &quot;By Studying the Masters and not their Pupils&quot;.</i><p>Also Gauss: <i>It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment (understanding).</i> Words in Parenthesis mine.<p>I am of the firm belief that the original Discoverer&#x2F;Inventor of an Idea&#x2F;Concept&#x2F;etc. is the best person to explain it since by definition they can lead you through the process of intuitively &quot;getting&quot; it. This is <i>understanding from first principles</i>. But since many of the original writings can be difficult to understand due to Complexity&#x2F;Time Period you need a &quot;Expert&quot; who can explain the main ideas to the Student.<p>So what Books can HN folks recommend that fall into this category? A few examples from my collection;<p>1) A Source Book in Mathematics by David Eugene Smith.<p>2) Newton&#x27;s Principia for the Common Reader by S. Chandrasekhar.<p>3) The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing&#x27;s Historic Paper On Computability And The Turing Machine by Charles Petzold.<p>4) Maxwell on the Electromagnetic Field: A Guided Study (Masterworks of Discovery) by Thomas K. Simpson.<p>Any and All suggestions welcome.",
