      "text": "Looking for input on what people use for documentation. We have an issue at work where we use a lot of MS Word for documents but especially now that we don’t print anything. I utilized Robohelp in the past which while clunky worked well for pushing out a document to print or format for the web.  But now just want to make it easier to access our project documentation and other required documentation that we need to do. And most importantly make it easily adaptable for laptop or big screens.",
