      "text": "Here is what I don’t understand: Every VC, consultant, incubator, and accelerator including YC, advises to not co-found a startup with someone you did not go to college with, worked on a project together with, or know very well before jumping on building a startup.<p>Peter Thiel said, something along the lines of it does not matter how great your idea is and your talents, if you tell me you met your co-founder at a networking event, or something along, I won’t fund you.<p>Now, it seems to me that a networking event is way the hell better to meet and get to know a co-founder than a speed dating site and a tinder version for online meeting and dating a co-founder.<p>I mean what’s behind this, really? Are they desperate to sign up as many startups as possible, are they looking for a couple of co-founders that look like they are a match made in IT, or have they just simply realized that, hey, if you meet someone online or at a coffee shop, your chances of success are not that bad, after all! Or if they meet on the YC online dating site, then they have to sit and think of a precursor project to work on first to show compatibility ...<p>I just don’t get it.",
