      "text": "I have a Samsung Galaxy and I am happy with it. One reason I am considering an iPhone is for FaceTime calls (nothing on Android has similar quality). It can also serve as a replacement for non-android&#x2F;non-WhatsApp contacts on iMessage (I don&#x27;t use WhatsApp). The camera is subjective and gimmicky. Apple Maps has improved considerably. Build quality is acceptable (not as good as Galaxy) but again subjective. \nWhat is your take on this? Should I consider only for these issues or is there a a larger issue at play?",
