      "text": "It started innocently.  There was (is) a submission from phys.org about birds and windmills which caught my attention.  Ironically, it was the odd article which didn&#x27;t provide links to the actual research or paper it mentioned which caught my eye.<p>Then in the comments, I saw a strange post from an HN reader (who was also the submitter) which merely pasted an intro paragraph from the phys.org page.  The comment and quote added nothing other than a visible &quot;1 comment&quot; to the post.<p>Looking at the submissions from this user, I saw dozens of submissions each day for the last several days.  Many had a particular slant related to a particular ongoing war.<p>Moderator dang is one person.  Is there any way we can keep HN from becoming drowned in garbage?",
