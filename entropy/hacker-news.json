      "text": "Last year when I switched employers I found out there&#x27;d been a payroll mistake and my taxes were underpaid by almost 8k between state &amp; federal taxes.<p>I&#x27;ve paid part out of savings (and sold a few things that had value) but the IRS is approaching a very grumpy stage and sending letters saying that it&#x27;s insufficient (it&#x27;s more complex, apparently I discarded a notice that would have let me appeal but I get so much junk mail I think I mistook it for a scam) and I seem to be approaching some kind of deadline before they&#x27;ll show up at my house even more angry.<p>To avoid this I&#x27;d like to try to find some extra part-time income.<p>I&#x27;ve done a load of full-stack (lowjs lately) work over the last 15 years in legal&#x2F;regulatory management, legislative informatics, &amp; data analysis pipelines. Django, HTML, HTMX, _hyperscript, LESS, CSS, Tailwind, HTMX, JQuery (still haha! ), RPM packaging, DEB packaging, containerization, etc...<p>Given that skillset, can anyone recommend anyplace to look (or know someone who needs a hand)?<p>I&#x27;ve poked around skillest, djangojobs, freelancer, (and heaven forbid, LinkedIn but they&#x27;re all looking for fulltime) etc... but folks on the sites I&#x27;ve checked out, frankly, seem to be unwilling to pay reasonable $$ and instead think a whole custom webapp with a DB backend can be built for $300 USD.<p>If anyone has any advice or suggestions I&#x27;d really appreciate ideas for working myself out of this frustrating hole. Cheers!",

While I&#x27;m trying to keep up with modern tech, I started to notice that lately I feel a bit like a dinosaur: I don&#x27;t get all this latest hype about blockchains, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, etc. I hear people build games on top of these technologies and earn a lot of money, but I just don&#x27;t get it: How, why?<p>Am I missing out on something big happening? Do you feel the same?<p>I would like to educate myself more on the topic, and would be nice if you could advise some helpful resources.",
