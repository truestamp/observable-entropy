      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I have been working on Tetra for the last few months and feel it’s now time to put it out there and get some feedback.<p>Please take a look. There are a few fully functional examples on the homepage: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tetraframework.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tetraframework.com</a><p>Tetra is a full stack component framework for Django built on top of Alpine.js. It is heavily inspired by frameworks such as Laravel Livewire and Phoenix Liveview, enabling you to create server rendered components that respond to user interactions reactively. However, it builds on the concept by allowing you to build “hybrid” components that also have full JavaScript capabilities using Alpine.js.<p>It also builds on the trend of bringing the different parts of a component (Python, HTML,  CSS, JavaScript) into closer proximity, by keeping all related parts in the same file. It uses esbuild to bundle your JavaScript and CSS, whilst also creating source maps, making it possible to trace errors back to the original Python source files.<p>In terms of future plans, I’m aiming for a v1 release this summer - there is still quite a long to-do list! I have been working on this in my spare time so far, but hope to find the opportunity to work on it full time. I think there is a gap in the current Python framework ecosystem, and I believe, that what I have designed in Tetra plugs that gap. I hope to build this into a significant contribution to the community.<p>Finally, the docs are here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tetraframework.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tetraframework.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;</a>",
