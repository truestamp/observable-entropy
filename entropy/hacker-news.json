      "text": "Since the CDC is currently analyzing the vaccine trial data to provide emergency authorization for covid vaccines for kids (ages 5 - 12), it might be helpful if the HN community can provide scientific data and literature sources (and their summary) that they will be using to evaluate the vaccination for their own situation, these can include<p>1. Data of covid disease in kids and how it is different compared to adults &#x2F; young adults (on deaths, hospitalization, long covid among others).<p>2. Data on efficacy of vaccines across time and strains.<p>3. Data on how vaccine trials conventionally proceed for kids and how the covid trials are different.<p>4. Data on how vaccines impact children&#x27;s growth long term.<p>The goal of this post is to collect information on authoritative, peer reviewed scientific data and literature. This can help parents to make an informed personal decision based on their individual situation.",
