She has emailed about a dozen professors, and she&#x27;s having a lot of trouble getting any of them to even respond back to her emails, let alone getting any information. Since most schools seem to require reaching out to a professor first, this has become a substantial blocker.<p>I was curious if anyone here who worked in academia knew of a better way to contact professors than just a random email for this kind of thing. Would it make sense to try and call them, or send a physical letter?<p>NOTE: Her location is the United States.",

I have bootstrapped a business that helps ecommerce companies connect with 3rd party logistics centers.<p>I currently have $5k MMR and want to grow fairly stable and hire on 3 developers, 1 qa, 1 designer, and 1 sales next year sometime when funding is there.<p>I am not sure how to go about seeking investment. Angellist looks like a good option but I need to incorporate in DE through them?<p>I guess I am just looking for other business owners to talk to figure out a game plan?",
