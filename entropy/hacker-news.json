How do we make sure we make best use of their time?<p>Do &quot;How we did X to improve Y&quot; posts work? Do you want backgrounders to our key area or should we assume knowledge and give a bucketload of detail? I&#x27;m assuming nobody wants promotional content, but if we say how awesome we think something is because we solved our biggest pain point, does that count?",
