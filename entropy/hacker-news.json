      "text": "Hi everyone,<p>An American friend of mine is currently working in the UK as a front-end engineer. His employer offered him the opportunity to move to London (sorting out the visa and the move) which my friend accepted. Him and family have been living in London for the last 2 years. Sadly, they are terminating the mission and his visa will expire in February. (It was subject to renewal)\nHowever, he and his family really enjoy London and they would like to stay. So we try to sort out options here with my very basic visa&#x2F;market knowledge.<p>Is the timing doable if he finds another job offering to sponsor him? Do you know any companies willing to sponsor him? What would you do?<p>Thanks everyone",
