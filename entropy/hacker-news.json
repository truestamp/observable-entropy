      "text": "Quick Leetcode style questions over multiple rounds have made the FAANGs, their cohorts, and most startups take in fresh grads who know Java as the only real programming. Nobody pokes around resumes these days in interview rounds.<p>Go-lang was materialized for these kind recently, but we are left with big spaghetti of code, far from clean and good practices. Programmers spend their whole career debugging the mess or just gave up.<p>Rust has given what programmers and companies want, giving no one a reason to complain. Less testing, low resources costs, quick deployments is what managers want.<p>Will the joy of programming return?<p>Will the cohort of employees be thankful to each other again<p>will they be passionate and innovative than recklessly money-greedy or burnt out?<p>Will the bad codebase be a thing of the past for the community?",
