      "text": "There are many options for IP security cameras and multi-camera setups. Ubiquiti, Foscam, Nest, Ring, and all of the things. But they all involve running untrusted internet connected devices on a local network. I want to improve my physical security with these devices without providing nodes to some  future DDoS botnet or whatever else these poorly secured IoT devices will get repurposed for. I also don&#x27;t want my system to be useless if the internet goes down or if BigCompany decides to change their terms or drop service for their APIs or whatever else.<p>Wondering if anyone has had success in setting up a self-hosted (maybe open source) camera system for their site? And if so, any advice? recommendations? sources for information that you found useful?",
