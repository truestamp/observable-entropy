I&#x27;m starting to need a more unique style of note taking &amp; todo list with dates and repeat tasks.<p>I find myself using different things all the time.\nI admit I am a high functioning scatter brain.  I&#x27;ll do the same task two times and do it different both times. Saving a project file for example.<p>Wondering if there are any unique tools methodology to help with this.<p>I need to split items up into personal, rental properties, and my side business.<p>Thank you!",
