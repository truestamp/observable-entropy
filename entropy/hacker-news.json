Upon further inspection it looks like the DNS records were changed. There was a CNAME entry that was causing this redirect.<p>Is this some sort of security vulnerability? I can&#x27;t imagine Cloudflare or our registrar would change the records to this spam domain themselves. I&#x27;m at a loss for how this could possibly occur.",
