      "text": "Hi all,<p>when typing this question in Google, the responses are quite diluted, with many results focusing on the RAM of a personal computer rather than that of a hosting provider.<p>I&#x27;m sure many of you here are good at SysOps and can answer this question better.<p>My website runs WordPress. I get around 30,000 visitors to my website monthly. I am curious on the technical parts of how adding more RAM&#x2F;CPU is going to increase the performance of my website. At the moment, even when I have 50+ visitors on at the same time, my CPU usage doesn&#x27;t go very high, and neither does the disk.<p>So, if I were to upgrade - is it going to be something that I can literally notice the moment I do it?",
