      "text": "After reading the thread &quot;Problems emerge for a unified &#x2F;dev&#x2F;*random&quot; (1) I was wondering why PCs don&#x27;t have a bunch of sensors available to draw entropy from.<p>Is this assumption correct, that adding a magnetometer, accelerometer, simple GPS, etc to a motherboard would improve its entropy gathering? Or is there a mathematical&#x2F;cryptographical rule that makes the addition of such sensors useless?<p>Do smartphones have better entropy gathering abilities? It seems like phones would be able to seed a RNG based on input from a variety of sensors that would all be very different between even phones in the same room. Looking at a GPS Android app like Satstat (2) it feels like there&#x27;s a huge amount of variability to draw from.<p>If such sensors would add better entropy, would it really cost that much to add them to PC motherboards?<p>----<p>(1) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30848973<p>(2) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mvglasow.gitlab.io&#x2F;satstat&#x2F; &amp; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;f-droid.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;packages&#x2F;com.vonglasow.michael.satstat&#x2F;",
