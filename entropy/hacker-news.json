      "text": "Last month I noticed that DNS wasn&#x27;t resolving for my domain, which I manage through 123reg.\nAt the start of this month, someone else&#x27;s website was hosted on my domain and the nameservers are now cloudflare. Worryingly, the single purpose of the site in question is offering to sell the domain.\nI opened a ticket on the 9th of May with 123reg detailing the issue, had some very slow back and forth with the support team - who were telling me how to reset the nameservers and not really investigating the issue.\nIt&#x27;s now the 25th of may and my last communication from them was the 23rd of may:\n   Hi,\n   Hope this message finds you well.\n   This matter is being checked.\n   We will come back with an update as soon as possible.\n   Regards,\nHas anyone experienced something similar? Any idea how I can escalate this beyond 123reg?",
