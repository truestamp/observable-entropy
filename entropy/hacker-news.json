      "text": "So I&#x27;m in my early 30 and completely unsure where should I go next. I&#x27;m undiagnosed schizophrenic in remission and here&#x27;s my story.<p>In my early 20s I founded a startup, got it on rails with traction, revenue and investors, and I was fired from it.<p>Around time of firing I started developing schizophrenia, still undiagnosed because I never went to psychiatrists. I broke all my contacts within a year, locked myself in, broke up with my significant one and switched to a social recluse lifestyle.<p>I started tinkering with crypto around that time and made some money, so I don&#x27;t really have to work a lot of time if I keep my lifestyle.<p>I kept my programming skills up do date, spent a lot of time with AI projects, but I was unable to find team-mates to work on these projects. Most of these projects I was involved with were solo efforts.<p>Eventually decease progressed to a point where I had no real life, locked in my apartment tinkering with AI and crypto, Terry Davis style. My schizophrenia symptoms were getting even worse to a point I had no real-world contacts except my parents.<p>Around 2019 my father died and my mental state gotten even worse. I landed in prison for 2 years for attacking a police officer.<p>It has been 6 months after the prison, I now mostly involved with AI RL, Rust and Substrate projects, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve completely lost a direction in life, with 0 peers still. I figured out I might just find a normal programming job, but so far my resume with 8 years of non-working gap keeps alienating employers. I completely unsure where should I go next. I have no social life.<p>Are there other misguided people like me?",
