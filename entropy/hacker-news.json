      "text": "I work at a middling SV company, and I see people taking averages of percentiles (or, even crazier, percentiles of percentiles) every day - that is, each server computes its own &quot;50%&#x2F;90%&#x2F;95% latency&quot; of all requests, sends it to a central time-series database, and the Grafana console averages them all to show a &quot;nice&quot; graph.  They are used for everything from alerts to launch decisions.<p>It&#x27;s driving me crazy because that makes no sense: you can&#x27;t average percentiles, you will get bogus numbers that randomly jumps up and down based on aggregation (how many servers you have, which tag sets you use, and so on).  And I&#x27;m apparently the only one who is seriously bothered.  Everyone else is somewhere between &quot;Eh, that&#x27;s the best data we have.&quot; and &quot;What do you mean the numbers are wrong?&quot;<p>Is this normal?",
