      "text": "Putting in place a Project Management&#x2F;Wiki software what&#x27;s the best approach to link existing documents?<p>Actually Users of the Company access documents of various type using classic approach with shared folders on samba.\nOn Windows guests (majority) those are mapped with drive letters like G:\\ H:\\ and so on.\nWith this approach people can share links to files simply by giving something like &quot;G:\\link\\to\\file.txt&quot;, but if you move around the file, all links are broken.<p>Company also uses Gdrive that has his own way to create links that also has the advantage to be the same if you move the file around trying to improve file organization. But if tomorrow some head wants to change cloud provider that&#x27;s a huge impact!<p>What are some viable approach to target this kind of issue?\nThanks",
