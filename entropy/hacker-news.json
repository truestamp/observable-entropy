      "text": "I haven’t seen any apps like this where you can guess the price and win the item on Appstore. \nGist of my idea - Basically build an app and ask the users to guess the price of an item. If they guess it right, they’ll get the item. Only one item in the beginning since I’ll have to fund it myself. Users don’t have to spend anything so I’m hoping the retention will be high and I can monetize it using Ads. \nAny suggestion is appreciated",
