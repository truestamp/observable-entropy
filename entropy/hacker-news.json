      "text": "I&#x27;ve been wondering about the problem of debugging applications, when some of your libraries are closed-source (provided by another company). If there is a memory-corruption, code from a library may corrupt memory used by your own code. I think ideally different libs should run in their own address spaces, so if you have a function foo1() from lib1, which calls a function foo2() from lib2, the call involves a switch of entries in the page table, to protect the address space of lib1. The call would still be blocking. And if lib2 crashes, it wouldn&#x27;t crash the whole application, but would deliver an exception to foo1() in lib1. Now the question is: has anything like that been done before?",
