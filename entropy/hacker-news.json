      "text": "When applications are running behind using some sort of proxy, there is often a need to make the applications aware that they are running behind a proxy, and often there is a need to manage request and response headers in the proxy. Pipy is an open source network stream processor and it handles the lower-level details and provides an event driven interface to developers. Pipy decodes incoming network streams into streams of events and makes them available to developers. Pipy’s versatile nature allows it to be used in use cases like HTTP forward proxy, reverse proxy, socks proxy. In this article we will look at how to manage HTTP headers in Pipy and see how Pipy makes it easy to manage, modify, and add HTTP headers.\nMore details, please refer to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.flomesh.io&#x2F;managing-http-headers-in-pipy-a259ba501822",
