      "text": "I have had this idea for a while, for months if not longer, but I never actually implemented it. I was always busy with some other stuff. It&#x27;s called &quot;Would you do it for a dollar?&quot;.<p>In simple terms: people can visit your profile and ask &quot;would you ______ for a dollar?&quot;, like &quot;chug a beer&quot;, &quot;hit on someone&quot;, &quot;french kiss person X&quot;... Then you fulfill the request and earn $1. You need to reach the payout limit before being paid out. I was thinking about paying out in Amazon Gift Cards and via bank account using Stripe. A buyer still needs to purchase coins on-site which the seller can later convert to cash. It&#x27;s all still work in progress<p>Seems very unusual and interesting, but I feel like it will be abused, especially by requesting dangerous things, so it needs to be moderated.<p>I started building some very simple MVP and registered a domain. If you want to subscribe it would be great <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wouldyoudoitforadollar.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wouldyoudoitforadollar.com&#x2F;</a><p>Site is already semi-functional. You can register even via Twitter, FB, snap, Reddit, Google and Discord. I decided to kick it off and put myself out there, people can ask me if I would do something for a dollar, but I&#x27;ll do it for free. If you want, try me out.",
