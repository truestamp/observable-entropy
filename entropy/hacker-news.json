      "text": "My software consulting business has been trying in vain for two years now to hire someone to run sales. We&#x27;ve now hired and fired twice, and the rate at which we receive applications for the role is low.<p>Meanwhile, we&#x27;ve partnered with one of our clients to build a virtual events platform, and have a working product and a few guinea pig clients but the project really needs someone to take on a full-time sales role. Or even a co-founder-level CEO-type role.<p>For technical roles, I know where to look (personal network, meetups, conferences, slack groups, etc), and I don&#x27;t feel like our hiring process is doing a great job of identifying competence.<p>I ask around in my network but my network is not at all sales-y. I put out job ads and get a slow trickle of uninspiring candidates that I don&#x27;t feel I have a good assessment process for. I don&#x27;t really know that many people in the sales&#x2F;executive space, I don&#x27;t know where the most competent people spend their time, and I don&#x27;t know how to properly assess peoples&#x27; skills.<p>Is there a good place to find ambitious, hardworking people with strong people skills, good judgment, and enough technical ability to be able to communicate those topics effectively?<p>Has anyone here had success hiring for these kinds of roles, and can share their stories&#x2F;processes?",
