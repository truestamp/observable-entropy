      "text": "Always admired people who can sleep whenever they want. I lost several interviews and life important events because I have no control over my sleep and every 2-3 days I lose my sleep till 5-6 am and wake up next day like zombie. I tried many existing suggestions including reducing my ambitions and anxiety triggering events by trying less stressful jobs, following digital well being, keep myself busy, meditation and having a routine but that didn&#x27;t work as well. One doctor said it is not anxiety it is hyperactivity. Has anybody faced similar problems? How did you overcome it?<p>Thanks for your precious time reading the post.",
