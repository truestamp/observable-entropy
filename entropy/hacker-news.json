If yes, which ones? If not, where else could I look?<p>Here are a handful of some concrete examples I&#x27;ve come across in the last 6 months:<p>- finishing off a hacked together CI flow for a django app for minimal downtime<p>- Evaluating and finding the right html&#x2F;js component to allow thousands separators in a text field<p>- Fine tuning twilio video performance and multiple streams<p>- Setting up a good developer workflow for doing nicer form layouts in django",
