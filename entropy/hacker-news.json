The blog posts themselves should meet the basic requirements of scientific work, so it would be helpful, for example, if citations were supported.<p>I first thought about Jupyter Notebooks, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s suitable for writing longer texts, and it also lacks citation management. Another idea would be Bookdown, but then the result looks more like a book than a blog.\nI am grateful for recommendations!",
