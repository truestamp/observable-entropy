      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I asked a similar question a couple of days ago, but for some reason it didn&#x27;t manage to get to &#x27;Ask HN&#x27;. However, before it sunk into oblivion, I got some really interesting comments [1]. So I&#x27;d like to give my tiny research one last chance. ;-)<p>So the question is:<p>Which app or tool (if any!) that is no longer developed or supported — or perhaps so far from mainstream that it’s practically dead — you used to use a lot, like a lot and now miss a lot? Can be pro or personal.<p>Feel free to share more than one, if you like.<p>Thanks for any comment. :-)<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31425990",

It’s such a shame to make so trivial errors and not catching them on QA stage. I don’t recall something similar before microsoft acquisition. Also about a month ago I reported a bug which displayed inconsistent languages ratio on a random page refresh. It was impossible for me to find the bug report page without googling, nothing changed since",
