      "text": "I know that downvoting is a controversial topic, and while I would prefer that there was no downvoting at all, I also understand why it exists. I also think that in HN downvoting is used very responsibly, signaling comments that don&#x27;t follow the proper etiquette.<p>However, what I don&#x27;t see so often is a reason for the downvote that would inform the OP of the undesired behavior and maybe give the opportunity to explain, elaborate, or even apologize. Downvotes seem to be &quot;fire and forget&quot; in nature. I wonder if anyone ever removes a downvote after an exchange with the OP.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d like to propose, could we force those who decide to downvote a comment to leave respectful feedback for the OP? Assuming that downvoting is not a way to retaliate against a user but to correct unwelcome behavior, I think that a comment would be much more effective in reaching that goal.<p>Edit: Autocorrect.",
