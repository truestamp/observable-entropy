      "text": "Show HN: Yet Another Speed Dial - An open source new tab page<p>I made an open source, cross-browser new tab page inspired by the Speed Dial in Opera.<p>It also works great as a bookmarks manager because it gives you visual thumbnails for bookmarks instead of just a list. When you bookmark a site, just choose the Speed Dial folder (or one of its subfolders) and you&#x27;ll automatically get a screenshot, favicon, or open graph image as a thubmnail.<p>They can be sorted easily with drag and drop, and since they are just bookmarks under the hood you don&#x27;t need to worry about the extension locking you in.<p>If you&#x27;re like me and still use lots of bookmarks, give it a try. Happy to hear your feedback HN!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;conceptualspace&#x2F;yet-another-speed-dial",
