I know a lot of people say they are more productive working from home, and I would like to be too, but that&#x27;s just simply not been the case for me.<p>I&#x27;m currently on several medications, and am talking to a psychiatrist, and the meds (Wellbutrin + Lamictal) <i>do</i> help a little, but they are insufficient.<p>I&#x27;m not proud of this, this isn&#x27;t me bragging &quot;look how little work I do!&quot;, and I don&#x27;t want any pity, I just want people who are &quot;good&quot; at working at home to tell me what they do to stay focused.
