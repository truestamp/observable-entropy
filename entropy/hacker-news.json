      "text": "Hi HN, this is something I created for my personal use and I have been using it daily for a long time now. It’s a page that shows top 25 links from the sources mentioned in the title. Updates every 10 minutes through a cron job and new links are always added to the top.<p>Some more details: It’s using simple heuristics like minimum upvotes&#x2F;comments to select the links. For techmeme, only the first headline on techmeme.com is considered a top link. For reddit, currently fetching content from only a select few subreddits.<p>It’s just a simple page. No ad. No tracking. It’s the first tab I open in the morning. Suggestions and feedback are welcome. :)",
