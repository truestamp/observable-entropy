      "text": "I&#x27;ve been told that Pacaso.com works only with accredited investors. Given the high pricing of their properties it seems like a moot point anyway.<p>But I&#x27;m contemplating a similar startup for average people - focusing on undeveloped land with recreational value. The concept is mocked up at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parcelplot.us<p>The idea is to make these fractional ownership deals open to regular people. Am I limited to accredited investors for this sort of thing? The business is mostly locating promising properties, finding a group of interested individuals, forming an LLC for them (with a custom operating agreement), letting them coordinate via the app.<p>Ideally I&#x27;m not limited to accredited investors because the idea is to make land ownership more feasible for people who only have a small amount of capital.",
