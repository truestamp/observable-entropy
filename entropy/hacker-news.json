      "text": "Last year I created an online order system for my youth movement which enabled us to sell anything we wanted online. This was needed as an alternative to the real-life events we could no longer organise and allowed us to continue financing our activities.<p>Recently, a man (~ aged 65-80) sent me an e-mail in which he told me he was impressed by the system I created (I guess because it automatically sends a personalized e-mail with his order details). He also told me he was interested in informatics (mentioning Excel and C#) but has lost perspective. He seemed upset about that.<p>I have been thinking how I can help this kind man to regain his perspective in informatics but nothing suitable has crossed my mind so far. That is why I decided to ask HN. What are fun things to study&#x2F;create&#x2F;implement&#x2F;think about? Or what is something he could do to impress his friends with? Or more general, what seems to be a good way to help him regain perspective?",

      "text": "Enterprise and startups are mostly using C# and Java. Some are using python (DRF) for their core, however Node are mostly used for small services and not as a main choice.<p>With the latest post about Remix (and all stuff that has been happening in JS&#x2F;TS world), I think Nestjs is also a solid choice on building scalable applications as a core of a startup. For the past few years it has been gaining tractions and many sponsors, going to the right direction as well.<p>Has anyone ever used NestJS for their side project that went off? What are the challenges that you get?<p>I&#x27;m trying it out for my next project",
