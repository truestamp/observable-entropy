Need someone to model those video with cadences where someone talks like a YouTuber, you know when their voice cuts right into the next sentence, sort of like removing frames from an action movie. They are getting to sound like that TV reporter archetype.<p>3. Identify the ‘please please like and subscribe’<p>4. Can we model the live ad reads and catch those?<p>I honestly don’t know anything about ML but I’ll literally sit through anyone’s Coursera (Will pay $$$) if you just walk through the concepts and how things like this can be tackled.<p>In other words, I’m suggesting the future of spam and ad blocking has to occur on this level, because there’s no other way.",
