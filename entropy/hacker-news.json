      "text": "Does anyone time their checklists or have checklists that would benefit from a timer? I&#x27;m thinking of information like how long does a checklist step take, how long does the entire checklist typically take to complete, or when&#x27;s the last time I did a checklist. I have two small examples in mind where this has been useful:<p>1. reviewing my finances—and making sure I don&#x27;t miss any transactions<p>2. GTD weekly reviews—to make sure I make enough time for a review, especially if I&#x27;m not as consistent as I&#x27;d like to be<p>Very curious if anyone else finds it helpful to time their checklists. Or does it suffice to just do a checklist regardless of how long it takes?",
