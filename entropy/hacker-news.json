(It&#x27;s a site that recommends various resources to teach yourself everything you need to know to become a true software engineer. Or set yourself up to become one, rather. )<p>However, I already found myself with some questions and I was wondering if there was a community (or whether somebody wants to create one with me) for people who are on the same path.<p>I have little prior experience but I&#x27;m very curious about CS, programming and cybersecurity. So I&#x27;d like it to be a group that is comfortable with slow learning and basic questions. Or even figuring out how to re-learn high-school math in order to progress to CS-level math.<p>If anybody is interested I will post my e-mail, but maybe there is something similiar already out there.",
