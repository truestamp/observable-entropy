      "text": "I have just released a new concept to try and change the car buying experience for the better. Https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autogenie.co uk. I recently purchased 2 cars that took months to find and many wasted hours trying to find them. At Auto Genie i want users to easily list the car they require so that sellers can easily reach out to them and sell them their car. No more searching countless marketplaces daily trying to find your dream car just list what you want and wait. As this is a new online concept i would love some feedback on the UX so that it works okay and makes sense to be utilised easily. Thank you",
