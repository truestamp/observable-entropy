It&#x27;s about as annoying as the cookie bar.<p>Why does it have to be 6 digits? Especially if it expires in like 5 minutes? And why can&#x27;t we have some sort of centralised solution to all this? The authenticator apps are probably worse than SMS in terms of the interface.<p>I am starting to think the amount of manpower wasted on this globally is way more than the fraud preventing in terms of economic cost.<p>Thanks for listing.
