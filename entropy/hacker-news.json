I wanted a drawing app with customizable keybindings, so I made qboard a while back and have used it since.<p>I talk more about the design principles on the Github repo: &lt;<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cjquines&#x2F;qboard&#x2F;#design-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cjquines&#x2F;qboard&#x2F;#design-principles</a>&gt;.",
