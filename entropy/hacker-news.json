      "text": "Hey all<p>My name is Sindre, and I am the CTO of Scrimba (YC S21). For the last 7 years, I have written all my web apps in a full-stack programming language called Imba. It compiles to JavaScript and its main goal is to make web developers more productive.<p>I just launched a major overhaul of Imba, so I wanted to share it here on HN, in case anyone are interested in learning more about it. It is very opinionated, so some of you might not like it, but I would love to hear anyones feedback regardless. Constructive criticism appreciated!<p>The backstory:<p>Imba initially started in 2012 as an effort to bring the elegance and conciseness of Ruby into the browser, and also because I felt that JavaScript and the DOM should be more tightly coupled together. Over the years, I have taken inspiration from React&#x2F;JSX, and also Tailwind.<p>Since 2013, I have built several business-critical apps in Imba, so this is not a toy project or an academic exercise, it is extracted from a real project trying to solve real problems. Today, we are currently a small but passionate community of devs who use Imba all over the world.<p>The nitty-gritty details:<p>As mentioned, Imba compiles to JavaScript, and it works on both the frontend and backend. The quickest way to get a feeling of how it works is by checking out this video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8XS5q9xhaMc<p>Alternatively, here is a list of the main benefits of the language:<p>* Clean syntax with built-in tags and inline styles<p>* Imba&#x27;s Memoized DOM approach is *an order of magnitude* faster than Virtual DOMs (Vue, React). Learn more here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecodecamp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-virtual-dom-is-slow-meet-the-memoized-dom-bb19f546cc52&#x2F;<p>* Imba works with Node and the npm ecosystem, and integrates tightly with both JS and TypeScript<p>* Blazing-fast dev&#x2F;build tools based on esbuild<p>Each of the benefits above are explained more thoroughly in our docs here, so please check it out if any of the above points spark your interest: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imba.io<p>With this version I feel that I am very close to my vision for what Imba should be. In other words; it is finally ready for public consumption. I&#x27;d wholeheartedly advice you to look into it and give it a whirl if you are interested in web development :)<p>Hope you like it, and please share any feedback you might have in the comments!",
