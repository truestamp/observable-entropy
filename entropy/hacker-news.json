      "text": "Hello,\nIm wondering if there are any ways to have a passwordless authentication for this new service I&#x27;ll be implementing.  I think I saw something the other day based on blockchain but didn&#x27;t see any implementation examples.<p>I was thinking of making unique URL&#x27;s and sending them to users email address.<p>If end users can access basic information that an admin has created for them, but still needs to be some what private. I do not see a reason to create accounts for all users.<p>A simple access url might be enough?<p>I&#x27;m not collecting sensitive information.<p>Name,\nemail\nPhone (optional) for sms notifications.<p>Advice is appreciated.",
