Didn&#x27;t believe it.<p>So I had only one step to do. Install Nvidia drivers. Used autoinstall. And surprise, surprise it broke something. \nMultitouch gestures stopped working. Spend multiple hours to realize it. Another drivers didn&#x27;t help.<p>Anyway for me the general question was. How do I revert apt get commands? It seems kind of difficult. I could purge all nvidia stuff or whatever. BUT is there maybe some general solution? That is the reason I&#x27;m always afraid of apt upgrade. It may break something and I have no idea how to restore. But maybe it&#x27;s just a newbie question. Is it?",
