      "text": "Someone posted this article[1] a year ago that I&#x27;ve used to effectively and inexpensively build a professional meeting presence on my work video calls (Zoom, Meet, etc.). The section on headphones[2] was the biggest upside of all, especially the inexpensive mic attachment.<p>I&#x27;ve had some success getting colleagues onboard with this, but some just don&#x27;t like bulky over-the-head headphones and refuse to use them, even if they&#x27;ve been expensed.<p>Has anyone identified high-quality earbud-style headphones&#x2F;mics that produce near-flawless voices from their coworkers? The microphone portion is extremely important -- earbuds might benefit the person wearing them, but if they&#x27;re using their laptop mic to speak, it&#x27;s problematic for the other people in the meeting who have to hear their voice echoing, their dog barking, doors slamming, etc.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24610166\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.benkuhn.net&#x2F;vc&#x2F;#hear-yourself-clearly-with-open-back-headphones",
