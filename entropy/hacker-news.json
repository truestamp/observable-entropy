When I asked them about what is special about this team they didn&#x27;t know. None of the recruiters have any awareness of the other. I haven&#x27;t taken any of the programming tests yet, but they keep getting renewed, even though I&#x27;ve missed the deadline multiple times in a row and haven&#x27;t talked to the recruiter again.<p>What&#x27;s going on at Amazon?
