      "text": "I&#x27;m a Spanish native speaker. I started working as a Junior SWE for a consultant company. We work with American-based companies so English is a key to treat with clients and teammates. Improving my English has been one of my main goals over the last 6 months.<p>I have improved my English a lot in the last few months. I go to classes twice a week and use it every day. However, I feel stuck right now. I am fully capable to have conversations about almost anything, but I don’t feel fluent at all. I know that learning a language is practice, and it’s a slow process, but I feel that I will seldom get a fluent level without living in a foreign country. It’s something that I want to do, but it’s not a real thing to do right now since I don’t have the necessary experience to make a company pay me a visa to emigrate (even in Europa where I can work locally).<p>I know that almost every non-English speaker here has been in the same situation that I’m right now, so I would like you to provide me with methods or things to do to learn English in a non-English country.",
