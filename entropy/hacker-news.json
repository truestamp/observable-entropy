I know the real answer is to go outside more and get a gym membership, but I&#x27;ve noticed mental benefits to working while moving.<p>I had been using a Treadly 2 for about a year, but after having it break within 6 months, get replaced, and then having the replacement break 1 month outside of the 1 year warranty, to which they demanded I pay $500 for the shipping &#x2F; repairs while it retails for $749, I&#x27;ve decided to give up on them and let everyone know how bad of a company they are.<p>Let us know how you&#x27;ve stayed fit while having a busy life! Especially interested in lower cost ways or more reliable equipment to use to accomplish this goal!",
