      "text": "I recently read the book Sandworm. It tells the story of how worms like NotPetya and WannaCry spread and how cybersecurity specialists tracked it. It does mention technical aspects often but it is not a tutorial. It showed me a window into Cybersecurity that was really interesting to the point of almost making me change careers.<p>I really enjoyed it and I was wondering if there are any books like that about software engineering. Not a &quot;how to code&quot; book, but more of a documentary related to software.",
