      "text": "In the realm of distributed computing, it seems like there are folks that believe very strongly in the actor pattern. However, they generally seem to be pretty niche? That said, this perspective could be entirely due to my bubble, and so I was curious to hear from folks that are using them in production, and how well they’ve worked out in practice.<p>Or, if you’ve evaluated using them in production, but decided against it, I’d love to hear about that as well!",

      "text": "So I had enough of failing to understand some of the words in English which are super obscure. :)<p>I&#x27;ve built Wordle Hints.<p>This has three hints.<p>One: You can select an individual letter to be revealed.<p>Two: You can reveal two hints which is one synonym of the word and another explanation of the word. A complete sentence which explains the meaning of it so you can understand and move forward.<p>I&#x27;m using this to further my vocabulary. It&#x27;s fully automatic, so there is always a word and explanation available. It doesn&#x27;t track anything, it&#x27;s free forever and I do make any kind of extra network calls. The whole code can be found here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wordlehints&#x2F;wordlehints\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wordlehints&#x2F;wordlehints</a>.<p>Please don&#x27;t scrutinise the Javascript and HTML too much.
