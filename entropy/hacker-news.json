I am required to because of my job as well as part time masters and bad habits I have developed such as sitting for a long time.<p>I am trying to become a funny person who has life and not just someone who spends time in front of computer. What are ways to develop hobbies? I go for a walk, but I don’t consider that as a hobby.<p>I guess whatever I do, I come back to feel that I am wasting time and I should work more to earn more.<p>Please suggest hobbies (solo are better) and any ways to develop them.",
