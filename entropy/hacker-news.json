      "text": "My question is for those familiar with the HDF-5 data format. From what I can tell, it does not natively support the Not-A-Number (NaN) data type. For example if an array of data values was stored and some of them were NaN then these would be converted to nulls which can then be read in (i.e. misinterpreted) as zeros.<p>Does anyone know of a standardized or widely accepted way of storing NaN in HDF-5 files?",
