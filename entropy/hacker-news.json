      "text": "When I think of asset managers, specifically in the public markets because of things like information asymmetry and stochastic market behavior, I can’t help but recall Taleb’s work “Fooled by Randomness”, specifically when he mentions that to be an economist, one simply needs to look like one, implying that economists have no special knowledge or skills, they merely are exceptional at convincing people they do through appearance and give a false sense of security, which is the basis of a charlatan.<p>Hence, I pose the question, is this true of asset managers? Hedge funds and wealth management groups in particular? Considering private asset managers have special access to deals and management strategies that give them a legal edge.",
