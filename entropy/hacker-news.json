      "text": "Howdy, y&#x27;all!<p>A friend of mine recently expressed interest in breaking into the customer success field and asked where they&#x27;d start, and I had absolutely no idea what to say. All of the places I&#x27;ve worked now do all of their CE hiring outside of the US.<p>What would you tell them if you were in my position? If anyone happens to know decent companies willing to take the chance on career-switchers, I&#x27;d love to hear about them so I can pass it along.<p>Thanks!",
