      "text": "Been using proprietary OSs (Windows, macOS) and I think fundamentally they&#x27;re rock solid. But I also fear the day that Apple and MS either go bankrupt or just stop supporting their OSs. It happens all the time at a smaller scale, like, each version of macOS breaks some features&#x2F;apps that I&#x27;m used to, and MS stops supporting Windows versions after a few years. I always thought Linux would be the most future-proof OS, but choosing something like Fedora entails the same problems as above (something being maintained by a corporation), and other distros seem too distracted that I don&#x27;t know if most of them will be around in a few years anyway.<p>Same thing with my tools. Atom was dropped in favor of VSC and Zed, despite having millions of users. Again, it seems something like Vim or Emacs would be the most future-proof alternative. Sure, VSCode is supposedly open-source, but I don&#x27;t think people will fork and maintain it if MS suddenly stops support. I fear that any sophisticated and complex project, even if it&#x27;s open-source, will not be properly supported outside of its core team, especially if there are competitive alternatives.<p>TLDR— How do you go about making yourself future-proof? In the sense that you won&#x27;t have to re-learn new tools every few years and instead focus on getting the job done.",
