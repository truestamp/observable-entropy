      "text": "I wanted to try out Unity so I created a small game with it. The reason I post it here is because it is based on an old DOS game that I barely remember but I liked very much. I don&#x27;t remember the name of the original game but would love to play it again some time. So maybe someone of the HN crowd knows the game and can tell me the name :)<p>The game might amuse you for 5 minutes or half an hour. After some levels, you get the gist of how you can move and it&#x27;s not really possible to create a super hard level. It could be extended with different movements to make it more complex, but I&#x27;m not planning to do so for now.",
