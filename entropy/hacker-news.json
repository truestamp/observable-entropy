      "text": "Long story short, been quite burned out after several years in the industry and been struggling to find a position in another company with a similar role&#x2F;responsibilities.<p>I now have the opportunity to spend some time back in academia. The workload seems very manageable and I was thinking to take the opportunity to publish&#x2F;patent and grow before jumping back in the rat race.<p>I kept myself informed, reading few papers from time to time but definitely not enough.<p>I was wondering, what&#x27;s the best approach to get up to speed with the hot topics in my community?<p>I was thinking something like, let&#x27;s get through the proceedings of the top 3 conferences&#x2F;journals of 2022&#x2F;2021, select a shortlist of promising papers (this can be tricky this selection itself could be biased by my judgement) and start from those to backtrack on the references.<p>Does it make sense?\nAny recommendation on how to optimize these efforts?",
