My biggest fear is mediocracy<p>I want to live a purposeful life and my biggest wish is to contribute to something meaningful and useful to others<p>Unfortunately in reality my life depends on meaningless work for corporate overlords<p>With NDA’s and IP-ownership clauses, i don’t own anything and i can’t talk about anything<p>My plan currently is to pour 100% of my resources into my own ideas. And at this point i don’t care whether they fail or not, i just want to try<p>I can get back to school and wage-slavery at any point in my life later<p>Do you have any tips? My parents are very upset. Maybe i should try to get investors on board so i could stop worrying about money for a while? Otherwise my existence makes no sense",
