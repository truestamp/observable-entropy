They have families, they have lives outside of work, and they want to just get on with the work rather than constantly climbing the ladder or doing performance review documents.<p>I myself am more interested in the work I am doing right now (i.e. building features that deliver more value to the business than the effort&#x2F;time&#x2F;money it takes to build them) rather than constantly planning semi-arbitrary &quot;targets&quot; every 6 months for a promotion I may not even want.<p>So - how do you manage people&#x27;s career planning (including yourself) when they have no interest in progressing? Is it OK to just say, &quot;I&#x27;m happy doing what I&#x27;m doing&quot;?",
