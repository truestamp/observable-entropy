      "text": "I am looking for the most secure browser for daily  browsing. Excluding any other parameter like privacy or functionality.<p>Chrome : the privacy breaches seem to be large enough to actually become a security threat as well. Is that a fair statement?<p>Firefox : seemed pretty good to me until I read this article https:&#x2F;&#x2F;madaidans-insecurities.github.io&#x2F;firefox-chromium.html. It claims that Firefox is more insecure than Chrome&#x2F;Chromium, in large part because of a weaker sandboxing mechanism. Even if this mechanism seems to be catching up, this points to a significant lag in Firefox&#x27;s security<p>Safari : is it secure?<p>Chromium : it seems to be the best bet to me, because it seems to contain the best security mechanisms, without the Google spyware. However:\n    1) it does not seem to provide an automatic update system\n    2) I read that it&#x27;s unstable because it contains bleeding edge code. That actually sounds like it&#x27;s less safe than chrome because of that =&gt; is there a way to know which Chromium version Chrome is using, and just using this version?<p>I am grateful for any thoughts.",
