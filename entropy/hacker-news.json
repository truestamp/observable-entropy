Each CYCO project\nis composed of a number of sequential &#x27;sections&#x27; corresponding to major\ndivisions of the score.  Each section is in turn composed of any number of\n&#x27;parts&#x27;.  A part combines an instrument with instructions on what that\ninstrument is to play.    There are several types of part, some highly\nspecific such as &#x27;metronome&#x27;, other more general parts include &#x27;strummer&#x27;,\n&#x27;controllers&#x27;, &#x27;bender&#x27; and &#x27;qball&#x27; (a kind of recombinant event\ngenerator).<p>CYCO takes a functional approach for time-specification and custom\ntime-cues may be defined.    It also provides a rich set of pattern\ngenerator types.",
