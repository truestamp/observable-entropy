Then it would simulate the entry of input something like:\n1) WinKey + R\n2) cmd.exe [enter]\n3) [enters or pasted a malicious script]\n4) await UAC prompt. Click pre-calculated dimensions for the button based on screen size&#x2F;dpi ratio..<p>Now the entire system is rooted in under 2 seconds.<p>Can someone explain what mitigations if any Microsoft has put in place (prior to the recent ASR which is new and probably also vulnerable?) to disable this [fake mouse and keyboard attack] ?",
