      "text": "Has anyone successfully run a (security) bug bounty program for a small company (~15 people) before?<p>We expect to recieve ~20 reports a year and given the quality of reports we receive by email so far we&#x27;d expect to pay out 2-3 actual bounties per year. On that scale, paying $30k to HackerOne is completely disproportionate and even smaller platforms like hacktrophy and yeswehack would cause us to pay a sh*itload of money to the platform compared to how much we would use it.<p>However, not using a platform would require us to handle payouts ourselves and paying money to strangers across the world without screwing up taxes is hard (we&#x27;re based in Germany).<p>Does anyone know if there&#x27;s a middle ground between these approaches?",
