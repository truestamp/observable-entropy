No pets, no one I need to consider but myself.<p>Here is what&#x27;s important to me in order of importance:<p>1. Affordability. \n    -&gt; So no SF or NYC. Ideally a place where housing falls at or under the nations average COL index of 100.<p>2. Opportunity\n    -&gt; I don&#x27;t want to be <i>too</i> far from at least one major population center in case I happen to lose my remote job and need to get reemployed ASAP. Ideally within a 90 minute drive of a city with a pop of at least 500k, these numbers are just estimates so a little longer of a drive or lower pop would be alright if it&#x27;s otherwise worth the tradeoff.<p>3. Weather\n    -&gt; I don&#x27;t deal well with heat and would prefer somewhere that doesn&#x27;t have blistering summers. High levels of rainfall is also a big plus.<p>4. Distance\n    -&gt; I currently live in Washington DC. If I could find a place that met these requirements near by rather than across the country that&#x27;d be preferable, but this isn&#x27;t nearly as important as the other considerations.<p>Again, any input is welcome and appreciated, thank you.",
