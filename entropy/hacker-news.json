      "text": "I was considering interviewing at Facebook. I am not sure if it is worth the effort though? I am in my late 40s.<p>What is it like to work at Facebook at this stage of my career? I am presently a very senior engineer and work on r&amp;d projects including new product development as well as presenting at conferences and writing articles on our advances.<p>While Facebook may pay much better, would I be throwing away a pretty good job just to be paid a ton but work at a much lower level? Is it not Facebook’s strategy to “overhire” in the sense of putting extremely qualified people on what would generally be considered menial tasks?<p>And what about age discrimination and work&#x2F;life balance? Do people last at Facebook for longer than a few years? Are parenting and family responsibilities honored?",
