If I get hired as a developer, can I have a life outside my work or I&#x27;m gonna have to learn the new hipster framework after work hours for the rest of my life?<p>3. Is it worth cutting my salary by 2 days a week to work on open source projects to build up a resume?<p>4. I&#x27;m fine learning say, COBOL. Should I go that way?<p>5. Am I better off looking for other jobs?<p>6.
