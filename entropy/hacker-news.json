      "text": "Hi there. I&#x27;m currently attending a group therapy session weekly on Zoom. Recently a group member has started talking about really inappropriate things against the group code of conduct and agreement. I tried to bring this up to the group facilitators but this ended in them accidentally including me on a group chain talking amongst each other that they weren&#x27;t really going to do anything about it other than another reminder at the beginning of group :&#x2F; And I guess in the end they&#x27;re right even if they talked to the individual it is up to him to abide by the rules of group. However it&#x27;s really throwing me off and I&#x27;d do a lot better if I didn&#x27;t have to be exposed to that if he slips up again, and I don&#x27;t want to be too obvious since I&#x27;m on camera as well, like taking headphones out, switching tabs etc.<p>Anyway this is a Zoom session that I just load in my browser on Linux (damn Zoom&#x27;s dark patterns :&#x2F;). Since it&#x27;s through their company&#x27;s paid Zoom account they control a lot of the settings so I don&#x27;t think a lot of normal Zoom options apply to this but to my knowledge I don&#x27;t think you can block or mute out someone who&#x27;s invited to a group chat that&#x27;s currently the speaker.<p>Does anyone have any crafty ideas, like using Greasemonkey, AI screen recognition, or any creative ways to solve this problem? I&#x27;m just trying to get the most out of therapy that I can and it&#x27;s really not good for me at this point in therapy to be exposed to someone talking about the stuff he&#x27;s gone on about. Something like a black square over the area and muting things once that speaker comes on and then going away afterwards would be perfect.",
