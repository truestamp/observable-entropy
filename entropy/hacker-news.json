I am planning to start up a global internet-based company with initial users in the US. To build global credibility, I&#x27;m inclined to incorporate in US, but on a personal front, I&#x27;d like to move back to India and operate from there.<p>Do you have insight on the legal, tax and cost implications of operating in such a manner? Would you do an alternative structure?",
