For example, the iOS versions of Discord and Slack when sideloaded on an M1 mac are much lighter on CPU and RAM while also being smoother compared to the &quot;native&quot; clients.<p>So if the dream of true native on all platforms ends up failing for someone&#x27;s use case, this might be a desirable option as a stopgap before going full webview on desktop.",
