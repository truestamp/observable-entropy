      "text": "For those, who have less responsibilities outside of work and more free time, how do you actually keep improving?<p>Let&#x27;s say I have 10 extra hours per week which I literally waste and feel bad afterwards. How could I use them productively to improve as software engineer? I know there are some blogs, or books (i.e. Designing Data-Intensive Applications). Just feels like I forget most what I&#x27;ve read afterwards.\nAnother approach is side projects, but it&#x27;s also hard to come up with any decent idea. Please just share what works for you. Thanks.<p>Not sure If relevant, but I&#x27;m Web Engineer with experience in C#, Java, Javascript.",
