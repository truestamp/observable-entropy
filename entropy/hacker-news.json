I’m so so on it, but I think we should just standardize it via a standard test that can capture general iq (ala the SATs). We have it for everything else like mcat&#x2F;lsat&#x2F;gmat, so we should follow suit.<p>I think this is the way to go because every company can determine their cut off. Google might want the perfect score, but many are fine with students in B- range. The C students will get good feedback on how to get to a B.",
