      "text": "I have all sorts of metrics I would like to count and later query. For example I have a lambda that processes stuff from a queue, and for each batch I would like to save a count like this:<p><pre><code>    {\n      &quot;processes_count&quot;: 6,\n      &quot;timestamp&quot;: 1695422215,\n      &quot;count_by_type&quot;: {\n        &quot;type_a&quot;: 4,\n        &quot;type_b&quot;: 2\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI would like to dump these pieces somewhere and later have the ability to query how many were processed within a time range.<p>So these are the options I considered:\n1. write the json to the logs, and later have a component (beats?) that processed these logs and send to a timeseries db.\n2. in the end of each execution send it directly to a timeseries db (like elasticearch).<p>What is better in terms of cost &#x2F; scalability? Are there more options I should consider?",
