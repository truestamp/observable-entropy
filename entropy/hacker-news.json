      "text": "Hi everyone! Twitter is a great way to build a supportive community and acquire potential users. In the past couple of months, I have been trying to grow on Twitter as part of my startup&#x2F;indie hacking journey.<p>One thing I notice is that I had better results when I consistently show up on Twitter, tweeting or making comments under people&#x27;s tweets. When I first started on Twitter it was difficult. It was hard to find tweets to respond to. To be honest, it is still hard nowadays. Sometimes I get too lazy looking for things to comment on.<p>As a way to solve that and help those of us that want to grow on Twitter, I am starting a free daily newsletter. I will send you three tweets to respond to. I&#x27;m already doing this for my cofounder via email and she&#x27;s been enjoying it so far. so I thought I open up this project to everyone who wants to grow on Twitter. It is probably more helpful if you are on a small personal account, trying to grow your followers.<p>The tweets will be entrepreneurship&#x2F;start-up orientated at the beginning. If there are many folks interested, I will send out surveys to get ideas from you about additional topics of interest.<p>if you are interested, you can sign up here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indiegrow.substack.com.",
