      "text": "Hi HN,<p>A recruiter from Amazon contacted me recently offering a job. I&#x27;ve been through their interviews a few times now and flunked.<p>He mentioned the same process as usual - coding screen, then a 5 round virtual onsite with a mix of algo&#x2F;sys design and behavioral questions.<p>At this point I really just don&#x27;t want to go through the entire pointless rigmarole again. I am a passionate and talented developer, but I suck at leetcode and suck at behavioral questions.<p>I might like to work at a few specific teams on Amazon if they matched my technical interests and skills. Like I&#x27;m good at performance tuning, databases, networking and ops.<p>Is it crazy to ask my recruiter to let me interview for team X,Y and Z directly? I&#x27;m imagining it more like a real interview at a startup, where I could just speak directly to the hiring manager and team members, present a tailored resume showing my skills at what they need and an interview process focusing on the actual skills the team needs.<p>Is it okay to ask for this? Is there any chance they will approve it?",
