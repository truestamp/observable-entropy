      "text": "The Solana cryptocurrency has been hyped quite a bit recently (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notboring.co&#x2F;p&#x2F;solana-summer) and has gained a lot in value. But it&#x27;s fundamentally flawed. I&#x27;ll explain:<p>People are like “Solana is the new NASDAQ because transactions are cheap!”. But NASDAQ is worth $31 billion. Solana is worth $22 billion right now and it’s not even 0.1% of NASDAQ’s activity.<p>More importantly, the token economics don&#x27;t work. Since there are stablecoins and the network is composable you don’t need SOL to buy anything, you can use USD*. SOL is just fee collection and fees are small. So very little value and high risk that validating the network isn’t economical.<p>Happy to see if I&#x27;m missing something but seems to me that Solana fundamentally can&#x27;t work.",
