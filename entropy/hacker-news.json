      "text": "Earlier this week, my son was unable to purchase a new Minecraft world because (I assume) they didn&#x27;t expect a non-well-defined locale (en_NL, to be precise). The marketplace is essentially &quot;offer.category.upsell,&quot; etc, and so long it fits in exactly 0 buttons.<p>On everything I&#x27;ve ever worked on that required translations, we always wrote the original text for this exact reason where (for whatever reason), the translation failed. At one place I worked, we had an &quot;en_US&quot; to &quot;en_US&quot; translation set up to quickly change strings without requiring changing the code and breaking other translations. Where I currently work, we have a function like __fixme(&quot;not yet translated&quot;, &quot;translated&quot;) that will use the latter translation if the former isn&#x27;t translated yet, allowing us to change strings rather easily.<p>However, after looking around for a bit, I noticed that it has more-or-less become very common to use &quot;opaquish keys&quot; and then provide a translation for every language. This surprises me since AFAIK, every i18n library will default back to the key if it can&#x27;t find a language to translate to, ergo, opening yourself up to experiencing the app exactly like my son is currently experiencing Minecraft on his Switch.<p>I&#x27;m curious why devs do it using keys vs. the original text? Is there some inherent problem being solved or is it just a personal preference kind of thing?",
