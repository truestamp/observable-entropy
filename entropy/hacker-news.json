      "text": "It seems we&#x27;re now stuck with the term &quot;Technical Debt&quot; to describe things needing cleanup. Non-technical people need a number we can use to express just <i>how expensive</i> putting off cleanup will be to make rational decisions we can all live with.<p>What is your personal estimate of the interest rate we pay on technical debt?<p>My personal opinion is that it&#x27;s around <i>100% per month</i>, that is every hour of refactoring put off for a month doubles in size. That is, it wastes an hour elsewhere, AND still needs to be done.<p>Or is the interest, just how much more code we have to write to work around the debt?<p>Also, what units is the denominator in the fraction? Is it code size, functionality, or just  calendar time?",
