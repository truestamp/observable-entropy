      "text": "Hello HN. This is a Sunday-heavy question. I love history and I usually learn it from sporadic books that I read. My knowledge end up being &quot;spotty&quot; (I can tell you everything about Cesar and Augustus but I know nothing about the Roman Republic).<p>There are some things that have proved to be easy (or possible) to learn online: Data Science, programming, etc.<p>Is there anybody doing the same for history courses? Anything to recommend?",
