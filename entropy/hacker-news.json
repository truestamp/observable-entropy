Tenancy\n2. Multi-cluster strategy\n3. Monitoring\n4. Shared responsibility between service devs and infra providers?<p>It would be interesting to hear from all sides - service devs, infra devs, sres and devops engineers.",

Last year we switched to Github Actions because of Bitbucket Pipelines instability. Recently Github Actions has been an even worse experience than github actions was before.<p>I was wondering if anyone had experience with stable hosted CI&#x2F;CD offerings that might have a similar experience to Github Actions from a development standpoint with a lot more platform stability.",
