Let&#x27;s say you can click on one button with bronze, two buttons with silver, and three buttons with gold.<p>Do you hard-code these business rules, or do you use a rules-engine? What is your go-to way to implement things like trials, discounts, etc. in the product?<p>What is your go-to way to fragment all the features into a feature grid&#x2F;matrix and grant&#x2F;deny&#x2F;limit&#x2F;meter access to any given feature on the fly? Do you have successful examples using rules engines for that?<p>Thank you,",
