      "text": "So, we’ve all heard of Doge and Shiba Inu, and my wife and I have decided that we want to create our own memecoin. This is just for personal use, no actual monetary value.<p>But I haven’t been able to find much documentation on how to do this sort of thing, or links to sites or services that can make this happen.<p>Which also leads me to believe that maybe we could start up a business helping others to do this sort of thing?<p>Anyway, what sites or resources am I missing?",
