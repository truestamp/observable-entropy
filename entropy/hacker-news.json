      "text": "Hi all, I&#x27;m a web developer with around 6-7 years of experience but lost touch with it since past 4 years. I know the basics HTML, CSS, JS , and Django. And based on that I want to create a basic course for people who want to break into web development. What topics should I cover ?   \nAre the basics enough or the new age frameworks like Angular, ReactJS , Vue JS etc are mandatory for beginners?    \nI am just afraid my course shouldn&#x27;t become outdated.",
