You click the button and randomly have 5 or 10 comment threads shown to you. That way:<p>- You are likely to end up with something new to read and consider in the thread and other people end up with something different<p>- You don&#x27;t have to click more a million times to find something new.<p>- Discussions and replies do not keep accumulating around the top comment in the thread that otherwise prevent more insightful comments made later from being read.",
