      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I often find myself having trouble making intuitive conclusions about a set of data. An example to make this more concrete: imagine a PM launching a new feature. He&#x2F;she is presented with a set of metrics regarding their feature and asked to describe the feature&#x27;s effects on the system as a whole.<p>I find myself lacking in this critical thinking department and also find the topic difficult to learn about. For example, should I delve deeper into statistics to get better at this, or is that just getting too theoretical and I should be developing intuition instead?<p>Any books&#x2F;resources on this would be super appreciated!",
