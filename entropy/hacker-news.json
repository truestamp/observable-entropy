(the importance of this site cannot be overstated - it would be comparable to a mining company knowingly and deliberately blowing up the Cosquer, Lascaux or Chauvet Caves in France, the ones with ~30 000 year old stone age paintings in them - imagine the outrage that would cause)<p>You hardly need to be some kind of bleeding heart activist to not want to even consider working for an organization like that.<p>Do you refuse to work for certain companies or industries? Why, or why not?<p>I should mention I&#x27;m no saint myself! I work in the travel industry and ask myself to what degree I enable massive CO2 emissions for people&#x27;s leisure, wasteful businesses having in person meetings that they probably don&#x27;t need to etc etc.",
