      "text": "Googling for &quot;Africa longitude&quot; returns the grossly misleading &quot;Africa&#x2F;Coordinates 8.7832° S, 34.5085° E&quot;. When you dig into why this so, it seems to be optimized for e-commerce, and no regard for accuracy.<p>a) This isn&#x27;t the geographical centre of Africa (Lobeke National Park, 2°37&#x27;N 16°06&#x27;E, borders of Cameroon&#x2F;DRC&#x2F;CAR), or anywhere remotely near it. It&#x27;s a random rural location 2400km ESE away, in southern Tanzania.<p>b) Bizarrely, that mystery location is (mis?)labeled &quot;оф. 3, 27 ул. Хабаровская, Bila Tserkva, Russia&quot;, which label is in fact turn  another place: 49.7968° N, 30.1311° E, which is actually in Ukraine not Russia, but that&#x27;s another story. I wondered if this was black-hat SEO, but it also seems to be bad QA.<p>c) The A-plus answer for &quot;Africa longitude&quot; would have been [&quot;17°31′13″W - 51°27′52″E&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geography_of_Africa). But &quot;17.5W - 51.5E&quot;would have been a fine result.<p>d) ... and the result for &quot;range of longitudes of Africa&quot; is the incomplete and inaccurate non-sentence &quot;Africa&#x27;s latitude and longitude lies between 9.1021° N, 18.2812° E.&quot;(!) which Google extracted as the first sentence of the site it bizarrely chooses as its #1 hit, the small Ottawa e-commerce digital-map site https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mapsofworld.com&#x2F;lat_long&#x2F;africa.html, which is more concerned with selling stuff than accuracy (seems to have an autogenerated page with incorrect information on latitude and missing longitude for each country). Again, very questionable search relevance, no QA, and you have to wonder how on earth this was ranked above reference sources, encyclopedias, atlases, geography sites.<p>e) Back to the result for &quot;Africa longitude&quot;, and less importantly, the information box with Google Flights doesn&#x27;t know where it is, but cheerfully offers to sell me a plane ticket with a &quot;15 h 35 min flight&quot; time (from San Jose, CA), strangely precise (and wrong); but when I click through on that link it&#x27;s a jumble of tickets to &quot;Lagos, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Nairobi, Tenerife&quot;, and none with a flight-time under 18h30. And no connection to the &quot;8.7832° S, 34.5085° E&quot; result.",

      "text": "It&#x27;s darned difficult to make a new and fresh word puzzle app, in today&#x27;s heated word game universe, but my kiddo and I tried, and this is our take.<p>1. The Stage - A box. Words popping out with missing letters. Ominous looking tendrils peeking out from the top<p>2. The Goal - Keep your words from going off the top.<p>3. Your Moves - A moving buffet of random letters to choose from, and the riskier strategy of moving letters between words (ProTip: That way lies Mt Doom), and Hammer Time to help you squash those stuck words.<p>That&#x27;s it! No ads, no tracking, no coins, no weekly subscriptions to get more vowels; Just words - coming at you like a horde of wilderbeast.<p>Developed by me, and PMd by my kid, who drove me mad, in a loving way (you haven&#x27;t lived until your 1st grader cries on seeing your memory graph going the wrong way), but we got to the finish line, and here it is...<p>Would love your feedback",
