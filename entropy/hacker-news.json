      "text": "Hi,<p>At my current client I&#x27;ve been doing more and more security related tasks such as audits on external software. Currently the type of software I audit are WordPress plugins. I have more than 15yrs of experience with WordPress and in the past I could fairly easily assess a WordPress plugin&#x27;s potential security impact(s). Nowadays not so much due to the seemingly increased usage of npm packages included with these plugins.<p>Often these plugins do not include a package.json, package-lock.json nor are the javascript files readable (bundled &amp; minified). This makes using npm audit near impossible. Good for production, less for audits.<p>Sometimes I can grab development files such as package.json, package-lock.json from a public repo, but in the case of so-called &#x27;premium&#x27; plugins a public repo is usually absent.<p>So my question is: How do you (security) audit external software depending on npm packages?",
