      "text": "Title says it all. A bit of an explanation: I used to game a lot as a kid&#x2F;teenager, and over the years it became less and less. Now with having my own family, time is rare but I sometimes &quot;want the feeling back&quot; I had as a kid and dive into a game.<p>I basically look for a device I can feel connected to. I had the Nintendo Switch and good experiences with it. I am now looking for a device which would feel good &quot;to have&quot; and can play a few games.<p>I am curious about your experiences. Do you enjoy gaming on an iPad? Are you a Switch person? Or do you have a dedicated gaming PC at home?",
