      "text": "There are a few technologies now that remove carbon from the atmosphere&#x2F;power plants and repurpose it into other materials.<p>However, not all of those outputs generate any income for the companies. So, right now many of these technologies are just used for doing the right thing. But in a capitalist society, solutions that make profits are more likely to get funded, scale and succeed in the long run. So, I&#x27;ve been thinking about what markets could be made for the companies recapturing carbon to then be sold into to make them more profitable and more interesting to investors.<p>Currently I&#x27;ve found that there are 4 things that carbon recapture companies output.<p>1. Turning the CO2 into stone. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbfix.com&#x2F;\n2. Capturing CO2 and leaving it as CO2 gas. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;co2solutions.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;\n3. Turning into a Carbonate Salt and then later into Carbon Gas. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carbonengineering.com&#x2F;\n4. Planting Trees and producing wood.<p>So, what could we make from this repurposed CO2? Given that trees turn C02 into wood, are there any other materials that CO2 recapture could produce?",

      "text": "There are many things about modern web development that frustrate and annoy people, but my two biggest issues:<p>1) A lot of SPA websites nowadays break my browser&#x27;s Back button.  I understand that this is &quot;easy&quot; to fix with push state&#x2F;history APIs, etc.  But it never used to be this way.  Now you have to do all kinds of special stuff just to get the basic functionality of your web browser back.<p>2) SPA apps almost always have to be specially routed at the webserver level to the index.html.  Again, it never used to be this way.  Without any special server-side routing I now have to visit the main page and then follow a series of SPA links to get to the page I want.  I can&#x27;t just go directly there anymore because most likely the CDN or webserver will return a 404.  Again, it never used to be this way.  Fundamental aspects of the web have been broken.<p>What are some other annoyances?",
