      "text": "Hi everyone, I&#x27;m a solo dev working on a project which I plan on launching as a startup. My problem has always been not finishing things i.e. motivation&#x2F;distraction&#x2F;procrastination&#x2F;etc. However, I&#x27;ve recently found a solution. Inspired by startupschool&#x2F;working space.<p>Basically daily in a slack channel you write 1-5 of bullet points of what you did yesterday and so do other people. Seeing other people take small steps consistently builds motivation, environment and some accountability. Then we have 1 day at weekend to demo our progress. You are average of people you hangout with, so wanna build stuff? hangout with people who build stuff.<p>Through experimentation I&#x27;ve found the simple rules that work the best for this:<p>- post at least one thing daily. even if it&#x27;s as small as paid for a domain name, or researched authentication systems. Just be truthful and do one thing minimum.<p>- while you post also write down just ONE thing that you&#x27;re gonna do tomorrow for your project.<p>- posting highly suggested even if you post N&#x2F;A, but it&#x27;s not required, what&#x27;s required is to show up for weekly video chat, don&#x27;t have to turn on the camera just show&#x2F;discuss what you accomplished and any questions<p>- be a developer<p>- miss two weekly meetings and you&#x27;re out<p>That&#x27;s it...<p>- Be a developer\n- Be actively working on a project\n- Post daily\n- Attend meetup 1&#x2F;wk<p>It&#x27;s only 2 people right now but looking to grow to 6 founders&#x2F;developers.<p>i guess also speak english, don&#x27;t have to be fluent",
