      "text": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.<p>I&#x27;ve come to realize that my mental health has declined to an unacceptable state. I know it has negatively impacted my work to the point that my employer has noticed. I intend to seek help but am uncertain how to go about doing so and how much I should share with my employer.<p>I suspect that I should seek out help independently of the company but I&#x27;m wondering if there is a better way than just picking someone I find online?<p>I have an upcoming meeting with my manager where I suspect my declining performance will be brought up again. I doubt I will have been seeing someone by that time and am unsure of how to go about talking about it (if at all).<p>I have been looking at getting a new job as I know this one is contributing to my issues, so I don&#x27;t think I could go about asking for time off for health issues and then leave shortly after.<p>I&#x27;m the sole source of income so taking any time off isn&#x27;t an option.<p>For further detail I would say that it is severe anxiety that worsened as a result of thinking it was  something else entirely.",

Also I&#x27;ve a strong tendency to kill those personal projects when they&#x27;re 25-75% finished, so they&#x27;re not really showcase-able. That&#x27;s a pity, because I feel like I&#x27;m good at what I do, but then I might just be subconsciously cocky.<p>I think I didn&#x27;t do a great job of writing my resume. I tried to be accurate, but I feel like I didn&#x27;t focus on the things a company would want to know.<p>I could use some fresh eyes to tell me what stands out on my resume, what kind of picture it paints, and tips in general.",
