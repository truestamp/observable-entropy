      "text": "This is the first ever release of Thunk!!<p>Thunk is a very simple and minimalist writing tool for anything you want: notes, blog posts, to-dos, recipes, bullet journals, etc.<p>What makes it different besides simplicity? Quite a bit.<p><pre><code>  1. Pages are cheap-you can quickly add them and just as quickly forget about them (they get &quot;lost&quot;)\n  2. Pages are indexed so you can search them like you search webpages on the internet\n  3. Pages are formatted using a Markdown-like notation\n  4. Easily usable on mobile as there is no need for a bunch of toolbars\n  5. Git-like versioning-no change is ever lost and you can move between all the changes\n  6. Included helper tools: lookup dictionary, thesaurus, and wikipedia from within the app\n  7. Collections: create a Page consisting of other Pages\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, I haven&#x27;t created a landing page yet. To try the app you only enter the email and a login link will be sent to you (there is no registration step). Once you register, there is a Page that presents all the features.",
