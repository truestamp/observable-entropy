After the price increase, the price of WeChat is 25 times the market price; storage space is only one of the indicators, and the price increase of other indicators up to 50 times is even more outrageous!<p>As a developer, you can accept normal commercial price increases, but this kind of price increase that is dozens of times higher than the market price cannot be tolerated; if you are also using the &quot;WeChat Cloud Development&quot; service, what you can do now:<p>Migrate to other cloud service providers as soon as possible\nComplaining&#x2F;reporting to the Municipal Supervision Bureau, this is a malicious price increase, not a normal commercial price increase",
