      "text": "Hello there, Hacker News. I have a theory: that HN is now large enough to warrant a targeted attack by paid operators in order to influence the discussion. I&#x27;ve seen quite a bit of circumstantial evidence for this over the last period but what I&#x27;d love to see is some hard proof. If there is anybody who has worked on the offensive side of such an operation I&#x27;d love to see a leak of the playbook that goes with attacking a website like Hacker News, what strategies are in play, how accounts are used to re-inforce each other and so on.<p>Any takers?",
