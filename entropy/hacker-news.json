      "text": "A thread on HN was flagged - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30345886 - however I believed based on HN rules of “evidence of some interesting new phenomenon” - this deserves to be a discussion on HN, and a serious, thorough, serious discussion at that: this is the 1st time Emergency Act (War Measures Act) has been invoked in Canadian history, and so I believe this 100% should allowed to stay up for discussion (not be flagged) - for people to have a better chance of finding or hearing the truth. The thread that was flagged linked to this BBC article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-60383385<p>Re: ”Half the money to the protestors is coming from Americans” narrative<p>Firstly, there is more money flowing to the peaceful protestors from other sources&#x2F;channels (cash, e-transfers, etc - including people spending their own money to be there) than either the GoFundMe or GiveSendGo - which this myopic news piece (to go along with the hack&#x2F;leak of personal data from GiveSendGo&#x27;s database) of course that doesn&#x27;t include critical thinking or discuss the broader context - and then people parrot the shallow narrative because they&#x27;re not thinking for themselves, but just repeat what they see in mainstream - or upvoted to the top of Reddit, etc.<p>Likewise, we only have the demographic data for GiveSendGo. I&#x27;d bet that if the GoFundMe donations weren&#x27;t attempted to be stolen that the demographics of the original GoFundMe donors has a high probability of being mostly from Canadians - and that it was the news of those funds being stolen; The funds blocked and attempted to be stolen via collusion with the government; a war crime under the Geneva convention by the way, to prevent resources&#x2F;support from getting to protestors, which Canada is a signatory to - which the police officers who stole fuel, gas and firewood, from the protestors will be held accountable for this, eventually; the Ottawa police who might I add aren&#x27;t mandated to be vaccinated or lose their job, the hypocrisy is quite shocking but telling here.<p>GoFundMe also broke their own standard protocol of not automatically refunding the funds to the donors - but instead saying they&#x27;d donate it their &quot;pre-approved charities&quot;. This action very well could have outraged the world and many Americans who then may have felt the need to support these more and more clear tyrannical behaviours.<p>Re: What’s happening in Canada<p>I hope people watch these first before commenting: Tamara Lich (one of the convoy protest organizers) and Brian Peckford (the last living First Minister&#x2F;premiere of a province, retired in 1984 I believe, and directly helped draft our Charter of Rights and Freedoms) did a press conference yesterday - which helps explain the situation.\nFacebook original link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;live&#x2F;?v=2883409135138326\nYouTube copy (poor quality): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CoMyyXRmR8U<p>The convoy organizers and protestors are vast majority peaceful, and not the myriad of other lies used by Trudeau to promote hate and mislead Canadians and the world.<p>The world is far more complex than most are willing to invest the adequate, necessary time to understand, but then are happy to feel righteous that their arguably shallow view must be right - making it easy to toe the line feeling like you&#x27;re part of the crowd&#x2F;mob, and therefore &quot;safe in numbers;&quot; Jordan Peterson would likely classify these people as intelligent ideologues, who he says are the most dangerous because they&#x27;ve really convinced themselves that they&#x27;re right - just provide them enough of a framework for shallow understanding and it feels plausible enough to be truth, when it&#x27;s only a half truth; justice dictates we look for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.",
