I was wondering if there was an established standard for single-line calendar events?<p>I know Ical exists, but i don&#x27;t want to have to create an entire ical entry when i want to flag a task to happen in a day.<p>Currently I have a current system like this:<p>- Listen to music \\{date: +1m} - in one minute\n- Code new feature \\{date: +1d} - in one day \n- Wake up \\{date: 9:00am} - next 9:00am\n- Go for a run \\{date: (9:00am)} - every 9:00am<p>Does anyone know of any standards like this?",
