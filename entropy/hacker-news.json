      "text": "Hi there, my name is Igor.<p>I am testing different ideas in data governance space.<p>Sometimes business users have problems with data trust - a dashboard looks strange and they don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a technical problem or a business one. They want to understand, how particular metric is calculated. Usually, these metrics are calculated via SQL, so I think SQL-To-Text might be usefull here to automatically generate descriptions and explanations for dashboards, reports, etc.<p>Do you think it&#x27;s a big and important problem which is worth solving? Will natural language processing (SQL-To-Text) really help here?<p>Any thought are welcome :)",
