      "text": "Hi everyone! We are engineers from Microsoft&#x2F;LinkedIn, and we released an open-source Feature Store called Feathr a few weeks ago (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linkedin&#x2F;feathr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linkedin&#x2F;feathr</a>). It has many highlights like below. Feel free to check out the repository and let us know if there are any questions! We also have a few blogs and recordings in case folks want to learn a bit more about it:<p>Open Sourcing Feathr (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.linkedin.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;open-sourcing-feathr---linkedin-s-feature-store-for-productive-m\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.linkedin.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;open-sourcing-fea...</a>)<p>Feathr + Azure integration (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azure.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;feathr-linkedin-s-feature-store-is-now-available-on-azure&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azure.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;feathr-linkedin-s-fea...</a>).<p>Tech talks on Feathr (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gZg01UKQMTY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gZg01UKQMTY</a>)<p>And its highlights include (more highlights are in github repo):<p>Battle tested in production for more than 6 years: LinkedIn has been using Feathr in production for over 6 years and have a dedicated team improving it.<p>Scalable with built-in optimizations: For example, based on some internal use case, Feathr can process billions of rows and PB scale data with built-in optimizations such as bloom filters and salted joins.<p>Rich support for point-in-time joins and aggregations: Feathr has high performant built-in operators designed for Feature Store, including time-based aggregation, sliding window joins, look-up features, all with point-in-time correctness.<p>Derived Features and centralized Feature Registry which encourage feature consumers to build features on existing features and encouraging feature reuse.<p>Happy to chat about it if anyone is interested in it!",

      "text": "I’m reading through The Pragmatic Programmer again, this time stopping at each tip along the way and thinking about my work and how what the book is talking about applies to me.<p>The first tip is to “Care About Your Craft”<p>I had to realize that I haven’t really cared about the craft in some time. I’ve been sailing through a series of meetings, deadlines, changing project requirements, office politics and general life that the caring of the craft is at the bottom of my list of cares.<p>I used to care about the craft in detail: getting formatting in code right, following best practices, seeking the new more efficient way to do things. But now it’s just get it done and push onto the next thing.<p>Thankfully starting to do some summer technical book reading has ignited that care for craft in me again.<p>So I ask you all, do you care about your craft? Why or why not?",
