      "text": "Every time that I start working in a new project I try to use the technologies that I know to speed up the development process.<p>Also I try to find frameworks or libraries that help me to accomplish the features that I want to add.<p>For example, I started a project with ReactJS and Next.js. Specially Next.js sets up the project in 1 hour, instead of tinkering with Webpack for days.<p>Then the UI libraries. I needed to find a library that had the typical UI components ready to use. Here is where the headaches start.<p>The process starts like this: I create a new branch, add the library dependencies and start setting up a form with selects, dates, times, text, dependent values, etc...<p>None of them just work out of the box. They have to be combined with other libraries for specific functionality like dates or form handling (I don&#x27;t want to give specific names here).<p>My idea here: to create a &quot;Frameworks and Libraries maturity state registry&quot;<p>Defining a list of minimal and common requirements (dates, form handling, validation, you name it) and characterize UI libraries that implement them.<p>Then they will receive a status like &quot;Starting&quot;, &quot;Almost Complete&quot;, &quot;Complete&quot;, &quot;More Than Expected&quot;",
