      "text": "Hi folks, a week ago I launched Rabbit Hole (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itsrabbithole.substack.com&#x2F;) a free newsletter where I go through 30+ product management publications each day &amp; hand pick one of the best PM articles &amp; send it to your inbox along with a 60 words summary every day.<p>I started this newsletter because I was overwhelmed by the amount of quality content on the internet around product management. So I thought if I can hand-pick &amp; send one best resource every day, it’ll help product managers not miss anything great.<p>Plus an article a day would be a great way of learning a little each day.\nP.S. At the end of every newsletter there’s a “meme” related to product management to cheer you up!<p>So please shower your support by subscribing to it! Checkout here  (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itsrabbithole.substack.com&#x2F;)",
