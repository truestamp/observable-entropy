      "text": "I&#x27;m not officially a programmer, although I code a lot. And despite the impression people get from me, my college degree is not in CS. One of my tech obsessions in the past few years has been reading about operating systems, their differences, their history, and the decisions they made along the way. Sometimes it&#x27;s a sad story (like when I read what happened to Solaris and BeOS), and sometimes it gives me joy (like seeing how Linux distros are getting more stable and consumption-ready for end-users). On that note, sometimes I ask myself how the world would be different if UNIX had won instead of Windows, and then I remember that I actually don&#x27;t hate the Windows kernel as it&#x27;s honestly a rock solid design. Still though, I think a lot about OS&#x27;s and sometimes get sad that Unix (as it was meant to be) didn&#x27;t get into consumer&#x27;s hands. OS X and Linux are out there, but they&#x27;re more like Unix-like OS&#x27;s.<p>But I feel like this obsession neither benefits me in any meaningful way, nor does it go away on its own. Is there something I can do that&#x27;ll help me stop thinking about OS&#x27;s and focus on the tasks and things that we can do on them instead?",
