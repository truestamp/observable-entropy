      "text": "The HN crowd seems to be pretty down on the utility of blockchain, beyond the obvious making money through speculation. So am I, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind being proven wrong.<p>With all the activity, you&#x27;d think by now there would be some famous, impressive solutions to real-world problems that could not have been solved &quot;the old way&quot; (i.e. trusting a central body).<p>NFTs are obviously hugely successful, in some way, but that seems to be largely a variation on the same old speculation game.<p>I realise there are serious uses of cryptocurrency beyond speculation, such as international money transfer or bypassing unstable fiat currencies, but I am more interested in the revolution in distributed apps and online services that we are supposed to be seeing.<p>Where is it? Do I just not know where to look?",
