      "text": "Hello Hacker News,<p>I need some advice, recommendation, or referral. I’m US based, and I’m starting to do some paid product management consulting alongside my day job. In the past I’ve relied on a pretty basic setup with TurboTax, but I want to level up so that I can expense more things, like my home office, computer equipment, etc.<p>What do I do to make that happen? Anyone have any recommendations, or even an accountant that I can just send off reciepts to and they handle the rest?<p>Thanks!<p>(I did a search of Hacker News, I didn’t see this come up, so that’s why I ask)",
