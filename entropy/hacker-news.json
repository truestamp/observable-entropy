I feel like I lack the time and energy required.<p>Of course, this also applies to Slack, Teams, and IRC, but is not limited to services that target synchronous communication.

Just wanted to tell you about a project i made in the last few days (written in Go). its called barley. It is just a fun little &quot;used languages statistics&quot; bar. (kinda like the github repo language stats)\n If you liked the idea you can:<p>visit the github repo (and maybe star it): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;baris-inandi&#x2F;barley<p>...or download the binaries: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;baris-inandi&#x2F;barley&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest<p>Barley is currently only available on the AUR (with package name ‘barley’). Install it with ‘yay -S barley’",
