The DB is too large to be able to replicate fully.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a tool that would accept as inputs\n* a database \n* specification of relationships between the tables in the schema\n* a root set of records across one or more tables...<p>and it would copy over the root records and all related records into another MySQL database, resulting in a smaller, but functional copy of the database.<p>I recall seeing a tool feature in HN to do this, but despite searching for a while, I couldn&#x27;t find it.  Would appreciate any suggestions for appropriate tools from the community.",
