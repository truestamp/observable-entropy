      "text": "I have the thesis that companies across all industries under-recognize their employees achievements. The nature of modern work is complex, almost always involves multiple parties&#x2F;stakeholders with unclear contributions. Due to that, achievements often go under the radar, particularly if an accomplishment can&#x27;t be easily measured.<p>In tech, I&#x27;ve observed that the most common recognition results from a feature launch that contributes to revenue or another metric, e.g. A&#x2F;B test launch.<p>For those who _do_ feel recognized at work, what are the ways&#x2F;processes that your employer recognizes you? What are forms of recognition that _don&#x27;t_ work?",
