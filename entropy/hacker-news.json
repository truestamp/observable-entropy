      "text": "I was the sole remote member of my team years ago when remote was &quot;a very special arrangement.&quot; These days my team is 100% remote.<p>I remember how painful it was for me to stay up at 1:30AM for a meeting, so I don&#x27;t ask it from other people.  I also won&#x27;t produce extra hours at the end of the day to watch recordings, so I don&#x27;t tell others to &quot;just watch the recording&quot; either.<p>As company founder and manager of a great team of responsible people, I need my team looped in with information they need to do their jobs, whether or not they make it to a call. Conversely, I also expect them to keep <i>on top of their action items</i>, whether or not they make it to a call.<p>Enter Neo, our trusty AI teammate, whom we count on to keep ourselves in the loop, whatever time zone or schedule we have that week.  He documents action items automatically, breaks out conversations into discussion threads, tells me which threads contain topics that concern me.<p>Most importantly, in my eyes, he gives me an easy way to follow up on specific discussion threads, post-meeting. Put another way, he helps us stay on the same page, bridging sync with async comms.<p>Sharing him with the wider world, but first with the HN community.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neo.vidd.ai&#x2F;hn",
