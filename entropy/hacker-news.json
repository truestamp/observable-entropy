      "text": "Context: I ask myself the question on a weekly basis and it always gives me clarity on where to focus at least some attention in the next days.<p>The last time I asked it myself, I was avoiding doing my taxes. So, it kept nagging me in the background. Now, I committed to an exact date and time when I will take the next steps towards my taxes. My mind is finally free again.<p>Sometimes, I also don&#x27;t derive an action to tackle what I avoid. For example, I found out that I was avoiding talking to a certain person. By that time, I chose to just change my deliberate opinion to not contact the other person any more at all. And my mind was free again. By now, I reverted that opinion though and reached out again. I am glad I found a way that worked for both of us. Now, the world is a better place for it - at least that&#x27;s what I think. Maybe we should all borrow more sugar? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yesmagazine.org&#x2F;issue&#x2F;dirt&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;community-relationships-borrowing-from-neighbors-strengthens-democracy<p>Anyway, I am rambling. I would love to hear what you are currently avoiding. And if you don&#x27;t want to share but the nudge helped you discover something for you, you are invited to make the post more visible to others.<p>I wish you a great day!<p>Instead I might just change my deliberate opinions e.g. I don&#x27;t want to talk to this person any more.",
