      "text": "I started a project in 2017 called `to-the-moon`: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aklos&#x2F;to-the-moon<p>Obviously, it&#x27;s a joke. But I keep thinking, what if we could actually get a small propulsion device into Earth orbit? All it would need is a solar panel and a fart, and we could set it on a trajectory to collide with the moon. Even if it&#x27;d take 10 years to get there, it&#x27;d still be really cool.<p>There are services that launch small satellites into orbit for a fee (usually something like $30k-$60k per 1kg payload).<p>Why isn&#x27;t this feasible?",
