      "text": "At my company I have to log into our VPN each day to be able to access our internal tools&#x2F;sites. Our VPN is already SSO enabled, or at least it triggers our SSO provider&#x27;s 2FA. It seems like once I&#x27;m logged into VPN, when another site that requires SSO Auth redirects me to the SSO Provider to have me authenticate, that the SSO Provider should be able to determine that I already signed into VPN, and from there for just automatically authenticate without me needing to fill in the log in form. I think it&#x27;s technically feasible, but I&#x27;m guessing it isn&#x27;t implemented.",
