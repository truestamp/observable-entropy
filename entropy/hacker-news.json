On that scale, paying $30k to HackerOne is completely disproportionate and even smaller platforms like hacktrophy and yeswehack would cause us to pay a sh*itload of money to the platform compared to how much we would use it.<p>However, not using a platform would require us to handle payouts ourselves and paying money to strangers across the world without screwing up taxes is hard (we&#x27;re based in Germany).<p>Does anyone know if there&#x27;s a middle ground between these approaches?",
