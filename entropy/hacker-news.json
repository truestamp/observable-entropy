      "text": "Becareful of the platforms you use because alot of scammers \nare roaming the internet street. I could remember how i was \nsaved by a Recovery expert after i was scammed of my Dogecoin \nand Bitcoin worth of 125,000USD, The truth is that i used my \nsavings to invest because i was getting profit and at a time \ni decided to use all my savings for a quick money doubling. \nThe platform had to force me to get 10referals before they \nrelease my money. Well, to avoid boring boring you with my \nstory, i searched online out of desperation and was lucky to \nget an expert that helped me recover my Crypto. If you have \never been scammed, i suggest you write to \nCryptoSwiftRecovery@Gmailcom for help. I never believed\n it was possible until my crypto was recovered and reversed, I \ndont know how he did it, but all thanks to Crypto Swift Recovery.",
