The task should take 10-20 hours to implement.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble picking a paper to implement. All the papers I found so far seem too difficult for me to understand, or not interesting. Any ideas on an interesting paper to implement? I did look into probabilistic programming, which seems interesting.<p>The paper is to be implemented in Haskell if that matters. Thanks!",
