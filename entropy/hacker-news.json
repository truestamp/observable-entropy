      "text": "There’s a pattern among history’s most successful &amp; influential people: Most of them worked fewer hours than the average American.<p>Darwin, Hemingway, Beethoven: None of them worked more than 4 or 5 hours in a day.<p>Yet they produced lifetimes of great work. Here’s how:<p>Hemingway would write in the morning until lunch. That was it.<p>Darwin would place sections of focused deep work in between long walks and reading.<p>Beethoven would write music for a few hours in the morning. Then he’d enjoy his day.<p>You’ll see this pattern over and over.<p>There’s a common thread among these 3 and many others:<p>Each of them had the freedom to organize their days around productivity.<p>They would work, hard, when they worked best.<p>By doing so, they could maximize both their productivity <i>and</i> their leisure time.<p>They understood that good leisure is intentional.<p>It’s not Netflix for 8 hours––it’s pursuing passions, exercising, side projects, or spending time with friends.<p>By enjoying life, you’ll do better work.<p>In other words, a balanced lifestyle isn’t lazy: It’s more productive.<p>Here’s a model you can use:<p>Treat your mental energy each day like an hourglass.<p>Many scientists and creatives think you have about 3 to 6 hours of truly focused work before you run out.<p>When you turn that hourglass over, make the most of every minute.<p>I’m writing this because, until recently, most people haven’t had the freedom to organize their lives this way.<p>But remote work gives you the agency to organize your day like Hemingway &amp; Darwin &amp; Beethoven.",
