      "text": "Hey there, interested in camera and range sensor fusion for point cloud (depth) completion?<p>Here is an extended version of our [talk](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oBCKO4TH5y0) at ICRA 2020 where we do a step by step walkthrough of our paper Unsupervised Depth Completion from Visual Inertial Odometry (joint work with Fei Xiaohan, Stephanie Tsuei, and Stefano Soatto).<p>In this talk, we present an unsupervised method (no need for human supervision&#x2F;annotations) for learning to recover dense point clouds from images, captured by cameras, and sparse point clouds, produced by lidar or tracked by visual inertial odometry (VIO) systems. To illustrate what I mean, here is an [example](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexklwong&#x2F;unsupervised-depth-completion-visual-inertial-odometry&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;figures&#x2F;void_teaser.gif?raw=true) of the point clouds produced by our method.<p>Our method is light-weight (so you can run it on your computer!) and is built on top of [XIVO] (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ucla-vision&#x2F;xivo) our VIO system.<p>For those interested here are links to the [paper](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1905.08616.pdf), [code](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexklwong&#x2F;unsupervised-depth-completion-visual-inertial-odometry) and the [dataset](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alexklwong&#x2F;void-dataset) we collected.",
