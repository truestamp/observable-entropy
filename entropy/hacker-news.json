When the very public accounts of the terrible culture started to come out, I remember hearing&#x2F;reading about the damage to existing employees should they decide to go work elsewhere.<p>Is this still the case for Uber employees?  Ultimately, I&#x27;m trying to decide what the long-term costs will be if I decide to take this mediocre offer now vs. start interviewing at more reputable companies (weighing the bird in the hand is worth 2 more in the bush yada yada...)",
