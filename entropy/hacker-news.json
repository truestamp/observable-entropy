      "text": "GlassX<p>GlassX is a simple context based state management library for React and React Native. It provides simple hooks and classes to get you started right away. No need for initializing a context or any such thing. Just start writing and reading your state.<p>GlassX is based on Reactn by Charles Stover but is more tailored towards speed building from the ground up and polished with modern react. It has a ton of handy features with a minimal learning curve which makes it perfect for everyone.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mychidarko&#x2F;glassx<p>Features\nNo boilerplate\nRight after installation, you can call GlassX.set to add items to your global state or use the useStore hook. No setup, no initializations.<p>Based on react context\nGlassX is based on context which makes it super fast and allows it to sit right in your app like a part of the react code itself.<p>TypeScript support\nGlassX is 100% written in TypeScript which gives it amazing support with most editors and allows you to create and extend types on top of it. You no longer need to stick to state management tools with sub-par type support.<p>Supports advanced features\nUnlike many other state management libraries out there, GlassX supports features like async reducers, hooks, plugins and modules which allow you to scope your state and reducers to particular portions of your app.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mychidarko&#x2F;glassx",
