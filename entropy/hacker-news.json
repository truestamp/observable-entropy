But i feel this is an attack against all of us. Every programmer should be grateful for the opportunity to find good quality content quickly. Now my search results are flooded with copy &amp; paste from SO. \nThey are killing that.<p>Am I the only one experiencing this or being that annoyed by it?<p>P.S: I don&#x27;t name URLs because if you don&#x27;t know what I am talking about already, you probably don&#x27;t have that issue.",
