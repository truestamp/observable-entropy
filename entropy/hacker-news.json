      "text": "I was working at a FAANG for the last ~10 years and just moved to a late stage startup. I&#x27;ve realized while I&#x27;m immensely fortunate work at a FAANG and enjoy it, I was still underpaid for my role and contributions. At my new gig, it&#x27;s very clear that people who joined 2 years before me will be soon clearing upwards of 5 MM when this company IPOs. I first hand know of people at places like Snowflake and Doordash.<p>My questions are - What are some of companies and positions where Software Engineers in an IC role are earning 1 MM? What roles should I be targeting Sr Principal &#x2F; Sr Staff? If you are this person, what do you think helped you in your career to get there?<p>PS: I understand devs at FAANGs are some of the highest developer. This isn&#x27;t a question about the ethics of how much money is enough. People have different thresholds and I respect your decision.<p>PPS: I understand IPOs aren&#x27;t guaranteed, market forces are at work, we&#x27;re in a very different financial market. Yes, given all these people still will be clearing that much money.",
