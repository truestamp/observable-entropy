      "text": "I have been trying to find freelancers for various tasks on fiverr for a few days now and it seems hopeless. I wonder if the whole platform is just fake.<p>The profiles and gigs all look like they are done by skilled people with hilariously bad English. Ok, maybe that is a thing. Virtual assistants, programmers etc who have expertise in their area but are not well versed in English? Maybe.<p>But as soon as I start communicating with them, everything breaks down. When I send them a long job description with details and questions, I get back a oneliner like:<p>&quot;Yes sir, can do!&quot;<p>And when I reply:<p>&quot;So how do we go about it? Have you looked through the documents? How would be start?&quot;.<p>I get something like:<p>&quot;I can do for $10!&quot;.<p>:)<p>What is going on?<p>How do you find real freelancers on the web?",

      "text": "As a solo bootstrapper, I wonder if hosting my own server on a beefed-up home internet connection and static IP-address might actually save me money and time in the long run. My app is Postgres-intensive, lots of external API calls, and some headless Chrome browser scraping.<p>- Having my server next to me is fun.<p>- I can buy dedicated hardware for the price of a 5 months of hosting on the cloud providers. A one-time investment of $1000 will buy me a 16 GB Mac Mini M1. Equivalent hardware would cost $200&#x2F;month on DigitalOcean with backups, and yet still wouldn&#x27;t have the same CPU performance as Apple Silicon.<p>- With the ability to connect a monitor and debug production workloads in more intimate detail, I might be able to optimize Postgres and the rest of my stack to really push the limits of performance. Instead of scaling horizontally, I can scale vertically, probably forever (my startup is unlikely to ever handle millions of reqs&#x2F;second or a petabyte of data).<p>- My service is non realtime. A few hours of downtime here and there won&#x27;t hurt. It&#x27;s a cron-job service which just needs to run &quot;eventually&quot; within a day.<p>- Since my service is heavily reliant on external APIs, I can maximize outgoing network redundancy with Speedify or other connection multiplier (over LTE, VPNs, etc.)<p>Main questions:<p>- How do I achieve redundancy on incoming requests with only 1 static IP address? Outgoing network is easy to multiplex with an LTE backup, etc., but I don&#x27;t know how to build redundancy for incoming requests.<p>- What else should I look for?",
