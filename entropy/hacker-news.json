      "text": "Using a throwaway so I don&#x27;t get linked to my main account just in case.<p>I&#x27;ve been showing signs of burnout&#x2F;high stress for at least several months, but probably much longer since I started working at current company 1.5 years ago. I finally have a referral to see a workplace psychologist, but to maximise effectiveness of this I need to understand my problems better and I&#x27;m not sure where to start. I&#x27;ve started collecting notes on my feelings and difficulties at work but this feels quite arbitrary, so I&#x27;m interested in hearing others&#x27; experiences. Ideally I&#x27;d be looking for something like a systematic process to examine different areas of my work life, common stressors and how they interrelate, or how to methodically identify cause and effect.
