      "text": "I need to host a static website with several 100s GB of text files. I&#x27;m looking for a small VPS that has however 1TB of HDD. 1 CPU, 1GB RAM, 100Mb NET are more than enough for the purpose. Unfortunately all the VPS plans that I can find do not allow for such small requirements with that much storage. They only scale the whole VPS, so if I want 1TB storage I would have to buy like 8-thread CPUs, 64GB RAM, 1Gb NET etc. I know there are &quot;storage VPSes&quot; but these do not allow webservers, they only work as network storage and it means I would have to pay for 2 VPSes.\nAny recommendations?",
