But, it’s not that stressful, I’m fast I would characterize it as pretty chill.<p>Amazon offer, would almost double my salary, and I don’t have to explain to anyone what Amazon does. \nSeems like a no brainer, but I have heard some pretty bad things about Amazon, their PIP program and so on, Blind is full of the stories.<p>So, is it worth moving from a relaxed position to something much more intense ? Will it pay in the long run having Amazon on my resume even if I get PIPed or leave after a year ? \nCurrently I’m “over performing” in my current position, and I’m getting raises and all the good stuff, but they would not be able to match FAANG on $ and brand anytime soon.<p>SDE1 position, just to be clear.",

      "text": "Why isn&#x27;t there more effort to build highway-bound self-driving cars?<p>1. Most commuting is on highways. A highway is a controlled environment with very few edge cases--less than existing L4 areas like Arizona and Pittsburgh suburbs.<p>2. Highway driving captures 90% of the value of a self-driving car, certainly for commuters. Any long trip, where it is valuable to disengage, spends most of its time on the highway.<p>3. An autonomous highway in a single city would save its commuters an absurd quantity of time and attention.<p>4. To handle edge cases, it is always legal to slow, even stop on a highway, and there is always a shoulder to pull over.[1]<p>5. Most new cars can navigate from onramp to offramp. But L4 providers haven&#x27;t taken the step to let drivers disengage, despite supporting L4 driving in limited non-highway environments.<p>6. One might claim that it isn&#x27;t as valuable for ridesharing, but it&#x27;s is hard to believe that there isn&#x27;t enough value for commuters, or there isn&#x27;t enough funding.<p>7. For rare edge cases, a remote driver can serve as a backstop, as in Waymo&#x27;s L4 driving.<p>I understand that it involves government collaboration, but companies have created significant regulatory change when necessary. For some highways, it requires no government collaboration.<p>[1] There are rare exceptions, but the geofence could extend only to highways with a shoulder.",
