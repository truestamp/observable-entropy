By the time you’ve figured it all out it will be easier to understand email templates anyway but still hell.\n  Sincerely, a guy who got tasked with doing email templates when my colleague broke his leg. I’d rather have broken my own.\n  Edit: didn’t mean this to be rude, just venting because I found it difficult!</code></pre>",
