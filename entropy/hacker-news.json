      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Node.js and Typescript for many years, and I&#x27;m constantly frustrated when hitting issues with npm, the memory usage, bugs in libraries, the state of the web framework ecosystem and so on...\nI&#x27;ve been hired by a university course to make a full stack application to manage reservations. I&#x27;ve been very happy with Svelte in the past, it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air, but I&#x27;m torn for the backend. My recommendation was Node.js, I&#x27;m very familiar with the gritty details, and it&#x27;s easy to pick up when I leave. I also tried using NestJS and Prisma for a second time, and despite the amazing work that has gone into them, it&#x27;s still painful for me to use when straying away from the &quot;chosen path&quot;.<p>I also recommended Rust (been using just over a year, I&#x27;ve loved it so far, compiled code feels so much more powerful than janky and fragile dynamicaly-typed languages), Go or Elixir+Phoenix (anything to get away from Node.js, but they are all quite different), but my supervisors aren&#x27;t too keen on a new language.<p>I&#x27;m not after performance, but a clean and maintainable architecture. I&#x27;ve heard good things about Django and Ruby on Rails, although I&#x27;m not particular keen on either. PHP would likely not be suitable, it has to do some background processing work. I feel like I could make any language work, it&#x27;s just Node.js&#x27; dependency problem that gives me nightmares.<p>I would value some feedback or advice, I&#x27;m doing my head in with decisions.",

      "text": "I find that most photos from an iPhone can be scaled down to ~400KB in an image editor and be indistinguishable from the original. There is no extra information in the excess data that the camera stores. What&#x27;s going on here? Why doesn&#x27;t JPEG compress away the excess 15MB automatically at the moment the photo is taken? Why isn&#x27;t there an option in the UI to shoot at a lower resolution? Assuming that the excess 15MB is noise, why doesn&#x27;t the camera itself automatically decide the optimum resolution?",
