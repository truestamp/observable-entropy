      "text": "Hi all,<p>CEO of DoltHub here. We just released Hosted Dolt: a cloud hosted version of Dolt.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hosted.doltdb.com&#x2F;<p>For those of you new to Dolt (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dolthub&#x2F;dolt). Dolt is like Git and MySQL had a baby. We built a SQL database from the storage engine up to support branch, merge, clone, diff and all the other Git idioms.<p>Hosted Dolt is ideal for building Dolt backed applications. The primary use cases our customers use Dolt for are (1) backing machine learning pipelines or (2) building applications that provide Git-style version control to the application&#x27;s customers. But we can imagine many others.<p>More information in our launch blog:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dolthub.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022-05-18-hosted-dolt&#x2F;",
