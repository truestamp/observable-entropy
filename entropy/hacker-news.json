      "text": "I&#x27;ve been learning a bit about Domain Driven Design, CQRS, and event sourcing. The domain I&#x27;m working with (at least parts of it) seems like an ideal use case of event sourcing.<p>But there&#x27;s a part of it I haven&#x27;t been able to wrap my head around: How to set up automated&#x2F;scheduled tasks.<p>I&#x27;m most familiar with Python and Node&#x2F;JavaScript, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m planning to use as a starting point for the back end of my system.<p>In the past I&#x27;ve set scripts running on a crontab, and scheduled tasks leveraging Celery, RabbitMQ, and Redis.. but I&#x27;ve never built something with scheduled data fetching that fed that data into an event sourced system. Using the tools I know don&#x27;t feel quite right.. like they&#x27;re the nail to my hammer and I&#x27;m missing something.<p>To simplify: Basically I have one service that&#x27;ll rely on an external data source (the data I need is available over a RESTful API), and another service that uses the resulting state of that data to create events in its own context.<p>Does anyone have experience with this sort of architecture? Could you offer any advice or point me at some resources?<p>Thank you in advance!",
