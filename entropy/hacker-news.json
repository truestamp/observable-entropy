      "text": "Roughly 3 years ago I launched the open-source blogging platform [Bear Blog](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bearblog.dev) (which was greeted by the HN hug on its first day live). Since then it&#x27;s been cracking along well, with about 150 blogs per week being started, and some prolific bloggers settling into it.<p>The best thing is seeing the variety of blogs popping up. I&#x27;m going to have to set up a list of &quot;neat Bear Blogs&quot; in the future.<p>The worst thing is the sheer number of spam accounts being opened (about 30% of new blogs).I review all blogs by hand in a Tinder-esque system.<p>Currently there are a few people sponsoring the project (about $240 per month) which pays for the server and my coffee. It&#x27;s fun. I only put in a handful of hours a month to maintain, update, and secure the blogs.<p>Next steps? I&#x27;m thinking of just keeping it up. Over the next few years it will become more refined, more robust, and more secure. This isn&#x27;t a financial project (my other company pays me a salary). It&#x27;s just fun building the blogging platform I want to use.",
