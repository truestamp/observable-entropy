      "text": "A good friend of mine has medical problems that severely hinder communication, both speech and typing, and may be degenerative or permanent. I wonder if anyone is aware of non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that would facilitate input at reasonable speed, from web&#x2F;document work to using an IDE&#x2F;terminal.<p>I know little about this area and current commercial options seem limited to novelty products for &#x27;brain training&#x27; and slow&#x2F;simple gaming, or very slow text entry of only a few WPM aimed at people suffering from total paralysis. I&#x27;m having trouble sifting practical information all the marketing and gee-whiz hype in this emerging field.<p>I&#x27;m being vague on the medical issues both for privacy and to avoid side discussions about diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment, which are already well in hand. So all I will say is that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a neurological issue. Thanks for reading.",
