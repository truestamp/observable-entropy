      "text": "Hi HN, I’m Sarim and currently building Neat (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neat.run&#x2F;) - our goal is to provide the most simple user experience for web notifications on your desktop, starting with GitHub notifications.<p>We launched on Product Hunt today (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;neat-97cd97b9-a2ce-416a-9e2c-97508fa5f840).<p>Neat has been a work in progress for a couple of months now. We’ve built other products in the past (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neat.fyi&#x2F;), all in the data&#x2F;knowledge management space focusing on needs of the workplace. With our current product, we hope to improve the notification management workflow by allowing users to receive, process, and act on web notifications from one spot.<p>A bit about the team. We’re a group of non-software engineers and self-taught developers. We’ve come a long way in terms of the quality of the products we’d like to be building.<p>Neat, today, is far from perfect but my guess is that a lot of the folks here would appreciate something like this and we’d love to shape the product with your feedback. Happy to answer any questions in the comments below. Neat is free to download today.",

      "text": "Yo. OtterTune is a database optimization service. It uses machine learning to automatically tune your MySQL and Postgres configuration (i.e., RDS parameter groups) to improve performance and reduce costs. It does this by only looking at your database&#x27;s runtime metrics (e.g., INNODB_METRICS, pg_stat_database, CloudWatch). We don&#x27;t need to examine sensitive queries or user tables. We spun this project out of my research group at Carnegie Mellon University in 2020.<p>This week we&#x27;ve announced that OtterTune is now available to the public. We are offering everyone a starter account to try it out on their Postgres RDS or MySQL RDS databases (all versions, AWS US AZs only). We have seen OtterTune achieve 2-4x performance improvements and 50% cost reductions for these databases compared to using Amazon&#x27;s default RDS configuration.<p>I am happy to answer any questions that you may have about how OtterTune works here.<p>-- Andy<p>================<p>More Info:<p>* 5min Demo Video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ottertune.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ottertune-explained-in-five-minutes<p>* Free Account Sign-up: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ottertune.com&#x2F;try",
