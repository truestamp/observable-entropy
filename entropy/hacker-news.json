      "text": "I&#x27;ve accumulated multiple macbooks of different vintages that I&#x27;d like to figure out what to do with. The issue is that they are usually not in great shape. I do have one that is in great shape, but I&#x27;m not sure how to &quot;blank&quot; that one before getting rid of it?<p>I also have a macbook pro from the prior model which has a bad screen. The keyboard is so-so, but the other parts are fine. Is this just something to give to an electronics recycling event?<p>Before I do anything, I&#x27;d like to make sure I&#x27;m not giving my data away.<p>What&#x27;s your process?",
