The rand has effectively lost 99% of its 1960 purchasing power. Given the high inflation in the second half\nof the twentieth century, figures for the major currencies are similar but not as extreme: the US dollar has lost 88%; the Swiss franc has lost 76%; and the British pound has lost 95% (based on the World Bank consumer price data).</i>",
