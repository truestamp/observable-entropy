We pay them thousands per month for tons of customers. Not trying to bash them but more interested in asking HN if EC2 etc is more reliable ? This is not the first time we had issues with them recently (used to be great before). So I have decided that we are completely moving off Vultr.<p>We do use EC2 for some and DigitalOcean as well to mix it up. I am thinking that we should completely move to EC2  as I have found AWS Support to be the best.<p>Is this just the way it is with VPS companies or is EC2 more reliable ?",
