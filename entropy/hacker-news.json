I managed to get into the best university in my region with the hope of learning, meeting interesting people, and working on things that matter.<p>I am frustrated with the way things have turned out. The things I do in college don&#x27;t excite me and people are extremely close minded. University currently feels like a waste of time. I enjoy my time working on side coding projects a lot more. University just seems to get in the way of the learning I truly care about and the tasks that I consider important.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear about dropout stories here, since there seems to be a lot of survivorship bias from people online.<p>I want to hear all about it. Good and bad.",
