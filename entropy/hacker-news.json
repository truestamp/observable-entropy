      "text": "With the recent T-mobile breach I&#x27;m re-evaluating which mobile phone service to use, and how best to configure my mobile device for security and privacy.  I&#x27;d love to hear recommendations from the HN crowd.<p>Ideally I&#x27;d like one without sim-swap vulnerability.  I recall Google Fi being considered one option meeting that criteria, primarily because they lack human customer service reps and thus can&#x27;t be social engineered into porting numbers to new sims [1].<p>Is that still the case?  Are there any others that do security and privacy well, that HN&#x27;ers are happy with?<p>[1]:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;soups2020-lee.pdf",
