It was 5th product of the day and it went way better then I expected (107 upvotes) . The github repository got 61 stars and is growing. The website itself got 40K requests, 4.8k unique visitors. Most of the traffic came from HackerNews and ProductHunt. I did not do any marketing other than posting on these social media channels.",
