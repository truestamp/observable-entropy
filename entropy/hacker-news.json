      "text": "- I started my programming journey in 2012, by creating small scripts for a SA-MP (A Mod for GTA SA).<p>- In 2016, I started college, studying towards my Computer Science degree. I loved all programming lectures, and was constantly among the best students in these lectures.<p>- In 2020, I graduated with a GPA of 2.9&#x2F;4.0 (73.9%&#x2F;100%), I was among the top 10 students of my class.<p>- Shortly afterwards in 2020, I started working as a freelance trainer at a coding school in my city, but the pay was not good, and since I was doing as a freelancer, I had months with no students at all, so no pay.<p>- I liked training, but I thought it&#x27;s not for me, since I have to re-explain the same concepts over and over again, it gets boring pretty quickly.<p>- At the same time, I built a website for a client using Django.<p>And that&#x27;s almost all I have! Now you might be wondering what&#x27;s the deal here, why did I just post all of the above?<p>I am currently stuck in Tutorial Hell! I have no idea whether I should be after Mobile Development or Web or something else entirely!<p>I am not even sure whether my current knowledge is sufficient for a job or not.<p>I know that I need to work on projects and a portfolio, but I have no idea of projects! And even if I did, I just can&#x27;t finish the project and I leave it halfway.<p>Is it possible to evaluate my current knowledge and get customized guidance on what I should do? Because I really need someone to help me out. I can&#x27;t just research on my own anymore.<p>PS: I live in a city with almost no tech jobs.",
