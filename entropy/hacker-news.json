      "text": "Last night I had a dream.  (No, this isn&#x27;t a parable; I literally dreamed this last night.)<p>People wore a VR device that could also monitor the person&#x27;s health.  Facebook used that to monitor the user&#x27;s use of oxygen, and used that to drive engagement - the more oxygen they were using, the more engaged they were.  (I say &quot;Facebook&quot;, though in my dream I didn&#x27;t see a logo.  It looked like an FB-style feed, though.)<p>That is, they were driving engagement to the point where it became a <i>physically measurable load</i> on the user.  &quot;Engagement&quot; became a sap on their <i>physical</i> energy.<p>Just a nightmare?",
