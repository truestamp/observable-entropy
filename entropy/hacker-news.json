      "text": "If you haven&#x27;t seen them, these &quot;shorts&quot; are 30-second (portrait) videos, often interspersed throughout a channel. I don&#x27;t mind these shorts, but they are obviously a response to the popularity of TikTok.<p>Some observations on YouTube &quot;shorts&quot;:<p>- The &quot;shorts&quot; have no video playback controls (apart from pause).<p>- &quot;Shorts&quot; take you out of a channel and into what seems (to me) a random stream of &quot;shorts&quot;.<p>- The short, bit-sized format of &quot;shorts&quot; make them popular for mobile consumption.<p>The idea of short-format video is not new (e.g. Vine).<p>What are you thoughts on the YouTube &quot;shorts&quot; feature? And what are you thoughts on YouTube &quot;shorts&quot; vs TikTok?",
