I know it&#x27;s a very complicated piece of software, but it would be wonderful to have another open source browser not derivative from KHTML or Gecko that&#x27;s fully customizable and built by a lot of people. Anyone else feel this? Maybe it&#x27;s just me.",

These drugs are very powerful but have really bad side-effects for most people that take them.<p>For these reasons I am completely shit-scared of them. I see them as my option of last resort but increasingly I feel my options running out.<p>I have tried therapy, I have tried all sorts of coping mechanisms but nothing solves the problem permanently.<p>So HN, what have your experience been with depression? Have you tried the drugs? What worked or didn&#x27;t?\nHave you been able to triumph without chemical assistance and what did that look like?\nIs my utter terror of these drugs warranted or should I just bite the bullet and try them?",
