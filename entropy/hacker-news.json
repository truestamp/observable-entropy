I own an Android phone that is not rooted.<p>So far I already turned off auto-update in Google Store but it updated anyway. It also has a specific permission to write to storage that I can&#x27;t even turn off (why bother show me then, Android?).<p>I&#x27;d love NOT to use it on my phone, sadly can&#x27;t do that.",
