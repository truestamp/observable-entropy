      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a fan of comics since I watched the X-Men Animated Series in the 90s, and I fell in love with collecting original comic art when I got my first Jim Lee sketch in high school.<p>But, after missing out on some original comic art pieces because I didn&#x27;t know when they were added for sale on websites, I decided to take it upon myself to make an app that monitors original comic art sites and emails&#x2F;texts you when new art drops.<p>It&#x27;s called Nerd Crawler and I&#x27;m building it myself so there might be some bugs but I&#x27;m hoping it helps comic art collectors. It works with over 40 original comic art websites like Albert Moy (Jim Lee&#x27;s art dealer), Cadence Comic Art, Artcoholics, a bunch of Big Cartel sites like Jim Cheung &#x2F; Jason Fabok &#x2F; Dustin Nguyen, Greg Capullo Art, Skottie Young, and more.<p>It&#x27;s free to try @ <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nerdcrawler.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nerdcrawler.com&#x2F;</a>, and you can upgrade to a paid plan if you want text messages alerts or want to check sites every 10 minutes or 1 minute.<p>From a technical standpoint, my tech stack is:<p>- Ruby on Rails\n- Hosted on Heroku \n- Emails sent by Mailgun \n- Texts sent by Twilio \n- Images hosted on Cloudinary\n- Credit card charging handled by Stripe and the new, low-code Stripe Checkout<p>The minimum viable product was built in about a week with minor bug fixes and new features added weekly.<p>If you have any feedback, have art sites you wanted added, or questions, let me know!",
