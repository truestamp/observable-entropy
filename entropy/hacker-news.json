The PDPL generally follows the GDPR but is a little stricter since it does not permit the unlicensed transfer of personal identifying information (PII) outside of the country except in emergencies. It is surprising that a law like this would be delayed one day before it was to take effect.<p>The announcement was made yesterday on Twitter, increasingly the preferred platform for official government press releases.",
