However, I cannot pay without signing in to my cancelled Google Workspace account. I do not want to re-activate the account, though I try unsuccessfully with the instructions provided to me by support.<p>Support now tells me that after 20 days a deleted account cannot be recovered. I contact collections to pay the invoice but they &quot;do not handle these types of accounts&quot;.<p>I am concerned this will effect my excellent credit.<p>I have tried multiple times to pay but support does not provide a means to do so.",
