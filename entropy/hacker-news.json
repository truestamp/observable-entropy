Before moving on to the next company I decided to take a few months off to just focus on personal coding interests. I’ve been able to learn a lot and now what I would like is to help out on some actual production projects. I’m not looking to get paid, I’d just like to have fun helping build something I find interesting. Does anyone know any good resources for finding such work, or is it all going to be found through networking?",
