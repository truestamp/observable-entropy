      "text": "There’s been much talk about the upcoming recession, layoffs, and resigning offers. On Friday, I got a recruiter called about a New Grad in Software Engineering at a well-known company. They said they’re sending me an offer letter next week (I interviewed a couple of months ago but got rejected due to space capacity). I got all the comp details and start date. I’ll be making more than my entire current salary in a year. I’m terrified of the company deciding not to extend it due to current economic conditions or getting the offer and rescinding it like Coinbase. Am I sweating for nothing? If not, should I stay at my current job, float out of the recession, and try job hunting? I’m a bit of a nervous mess, honestly.",

It would take me longer to learn and build something. With the tech stack above, I was able to launch the project after 10 hours working on it.<p>Don’t get me wrong. My background is engineering, working as a developer for 10+ years. I know how important is to use the best practices, reduce tech debt as much as we can, etc.<p>Hopefully I’ll be able to help people  looking for new opportunities in this tough moment.<p>What do you think? Do you use the latest tech stack when building a new product? Go with a tech stack that you will be more productive?",
