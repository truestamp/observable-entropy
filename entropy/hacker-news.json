      "text": "Today was an exciting day at Amy.<p>After a 4 month sprint, we&#x27;ve launched on Product Hunt today. I&#x27;d call it luck, but frankly, it was 95% hard work, preparation and our team&#x27;s engagement that put us at the #1 spot an hour after launch. A longer post will come soon, but these are the main points:<p>1. We set our goals - by knowing exactly where we want to get, mapping out how to get there was fairly simple.<p>2. Engagement - from day 1, our team got to work on Product Hunt. We created discussions, kept active and grew our following base to hundreds of followers. This really helped bring in organic traffic to our PH post.<p>3. Great visuals - Talking about your product is great. Showing your product is even better. With the help of a video production studio and our design team, we created 4 simple, to-the-point visual aids that showcase Amy to its full extent.<p>4. Working with users - It was super important for me, as head of product to talk to our users and test different marketing elements with them. This helped sharpen not only our value proposition, but copy, testimonials, and visual elements.<p>5. Our team - I&#x27;ve launched on PH several times, and got some great results (my last company was a 2 hour hackathon that ended in a product launch that grew to 50k users and +$1M revenue). This time, we had a full team working around-the-clock to execute on our plan. Amy team - kudos!<p>As I stated earlier, a long, deep-dive blog post will come out after our launch ends, and I&#x27;ll post it here.<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;d love to get your support and feedback. Please head over to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;amy-2 to check out Amy!",

      "text": "I have an 8 year old boy who wants to chat (txt, voice, video) with his friends online, so they can arrange to play games, etc. I&#x27;m not keen on giving him a mobile phone yet and a lot of the platforms like Discord, Slack, etc don&#x27;t have much in the way of parental controls. Ideally I&#x27;d like something where I (and the other parents) can supervise, moderate and control who has access to the groups and which groups the kids have access to, without having to worry about what other content and people on the platform they could be exposed to. I don&#x27;t have a problem with self hosting, if that&#x27;s the best option. How have others in the Hacker News collective approached this?",
