      "text": "People usually view documents on a computer now, which means that page margins and page breaks don’t matter.<p>So maybe WYSIWYG is not the best term to use since what you see on the screen doesn&#x27;t necessarily match what you see in the output.<p>Another point: I use Fira Code for programming because I like the ligatures. Moreover, I use TeXmacs to write notes because I like the way the text is typeset with high quality while I edit my notes. In both cases, the editing experience is made more pleasant but other people don&#x27;t see the nice visuals. In other words, WYSIWYG is problematic because there is no output that matches the editing experience.<p>So maybe meta-WYSIWYG would be a better term to use nowadays to take into account these considerations?",
