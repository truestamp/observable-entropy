What nonprofits do you support?<p>Personally, I like GiveDirectly—their work is research-backed and life-changing—and if you&#x27;re interested in donating to them I&#x27;d appreciate if you did so through my weird little romantic art project (100% of your donation goes to GiveDirectly): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helpmepropose.live<p>I&#x27;d love to learn about other great organizations!",
