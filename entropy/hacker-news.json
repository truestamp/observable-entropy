      "text": "It&#x27;s my understanding that the amount of money circling in crypto space has no correlation to utility crypto provides. I don&#x27;t see people buying  groceries with crypto, I don&#x27;t see blockchain replacing SQL databases. But there is one space that&#x27;s thriving... people who are making tools to sell, buy, create, store and teach crypto products. Investors are jumping in to fund these tools just for the sake of being involved somehow, FOMO, banks are jumping in to gamble on assets &#x2F; speculate.... Everyone is jumping with hopes of  making money in it and almost no one understands why they are doing  what they are doing. There is lot of activity and innovations, but fundamental problem still remains... nobody uses blockchain or coin successfully,  it literally has no feature that is better than traditional infrastructure and therefore it&#x27;s not used in any respectable business (there are lots of businesses x but on blockchain but they are just products, as they have  no customers). I have never seen such collective FOMO over something that is so fundamentally flawed.",
