      "text": "This question was originally asked to the Reddit &#x2F;r&#x2F;ActiveDirectory community, great feedback.<p>We&#x27;ve been doing directory synchronization solutions for quite a while but came across a request to verbatim copy a very large LDAP directory locally to save on bandwidth.<p>Out came this new product that when pointed to a source part of a tree can copy everything under that to another ldap server. You can filter which attributes you want, it can perform delta discoveries and can keep everything up to date on each run. Oh and its extremely fast. Everything is copied as-is including the dn structure etc. Its basically replication over a single ldap port without having to have server agreements or extra special ports.<p>It&#x27;s a very niche product but I think it has uses for things like test environments, easy update of satellite office local directory servers etc.<p>My question for the identity&#x2F;directory&#x2F;ldap admins out there is:<p>Do we have a product that solves a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist?<p>tia.",
