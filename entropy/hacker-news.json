      "text": "I&#x27;m a solo developer with an identical product to a well-funded competitor ABC (has crazy momentum). The competitor is well-loved and widely recognized in the market.<p>When I describe my startup to anyone they ask &quot;how is this different from ABC?&quot;.<p>Being solo and the startup being my main occupation and ambitions to scale, it is very discouraging to hear time and again that what I&#x27;ve built is similar in most important aspects to ABC.<p>I have paying users, but operate at probably 1&#x2F;1000th the scale of ABC.<p>I would work on narrowing my target audience and building for them, but results are not guaranteed. At this point I would like some certainty that my efforts will pay off, but honestly, I don&#x27;t think I can expect that.<p>I&#x27;m pretty frustrated with the risk I&#x27;ve taken on so far and the years of effort I&#x27;ve put into it, only to end up a clone.<p>That said, I think this situation is probably familiar to those new calendar-booking apps, email apps, etc. They&#x27;ve found a way to stand out despite the presence of calendly, gmail, etc. I take inspiration from them and will carry on trying to find differentiation.<p>My question goes out to anyone familiar with this situation: how do you change your product strategy to be successful despite an 800-lb gorilla in your market?<p>Regardless of my question, if you have words of motivation or general advice, please share that too. I could use some positive energy from the universe today.",
