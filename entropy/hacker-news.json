      "text": "System76 recently announced their responsiveness optimizer, System76 Scheduler [0], which basically works as a daemon, adjusting the nice value and the CFS knobs for processes in the box for increased responsiveness. They&#x27;ve claimed that the responsiveness is therefore increased, which I&#x27;m also believed so.<p>However, this got me wondering, is there exists any tool that can report the &quot;numbers&quot; (e.g., scheduling latency) regarding to the responsivenss? Maybe Google has such tool for testing regression for Android or Chrome OS, sadly, I didn&#x27;t managed to find one.<p>Thanks!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pop-os&#x2F;system76-scheduler",
