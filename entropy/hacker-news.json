      "text": "The background: Booked a procedure in a hospital, only to to find out that the total contractual amount (the hospital &#x27;insured&#x27; price) is 250% higher than average amount @zip.  The quoted price is 22% even higher than the out of network average.[1]<p>Therefore, I tried getting competing quotes from nearby facilities. The only billing team that responded actually stated they &quot;don&#x27;t quote patient-portion costs&quot;. [3]<p>They suggested we check their &quot;standard charges&quot; list, which is a JSON file that cannot be opened by firefox. [2]  (Can&#x27;t seem to open with JSON viewer either)<p>This wouldn&#x27;t seem to be a reasonable way to deal with patients seeking valid financial info. Do you have experience on successfully getting price info ? And, is there a regulatory agency to complain to due to lack of disclosure ?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairhealthconsumer.org&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nyp.org&#x2F;patients-visitors&#x2F;paying-for-care&#x2F;hospital-price-transparency&#x2F;standard-charges<p>[3] Good morning,<p>The hospital does not process estimates for patients with insurance coverage. However, our web portal contains charges under the Hospital Price Transparency link. I have included the link in the subject line for easy access. As far as out-pocket responsibility, your insurance company is the best source for that information; they will advise if you have any copay for the encounter.<p>Respectfully,<p>XXXXXXXXXX\nFinancial Clearance Center Supervisor\nEmail:     xxxx@nyp.org\n______________________________________________ \nFrom: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nSent: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx\nTo: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX @nyp.org&gt;\nSubject: [EXTERNAL] Patient responsibility inquiry<p>Hello!<p>I was told by the very helpful Ms. XXXX, that you would be able to provide patient responsibility amount , related to facility CPT codes for a XXXXX procedure.<p>For this purpose, I am attaching front and back of my insurance card (XXXXX).  The member DOB is xxxxxx.  The specific 2 codes in question are :\nCPT XXXXX\nCPT XXXXX \nCan you please provide the total patient cost for the facility charges for the CPTs above, so I know how much we are expected to pay ourselves (after insurance) for this in-network procedure?<p>Also, can you let me know if there is some kind of additional surcharge &#x2F; tax ?<p>Thank you.",
