This single cluster (let&#x27;s call it main), consists of a single primary and multiple read-only replicas and stores the data generated by all GitLab features. Database reads can be scaled horizontally through read-only replicas, but writes cannot because PostgreSQL does not support active-active replication natively.<p>All you need is Postgres. IIRC Reddit had a similar starting story.<p>Excited to see how much faster gitlab.com will be and how much more reliable their CI gets (I don&#x27;t have numbers on hand, but I think they&#x27;ve gone down less than GH Actions in recent memory at least -- maybe there&#x27;s some recency bias there).<p>In a world where Citus is now fully open source[1], I wonder if it needs to just get pulled into contrib.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencoreventures.com&#x2F;<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citusdata.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;17&#x2F;citus-11-goes-fully-open-source&#x2F;",
