What impact would available team size have on architecture decisions? E.g. a team of 2-3 vs a team of 12 vs 30.<p>I think the Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;AirBnB&#x2F;etc way of doing things isn&#x27;t suitable for a lot of small teams, however it is the latest hot tech that always seems to get implemented in early stage startups.
