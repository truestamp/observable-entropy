      "text": "I&#x27;m 50. I started my career as a developer but my role over the past 15 years has morphed into a professional generalist in small (&lt;10 people) financial firms. I have responsibility for all non-revenue activities (legal, accounting, audit, operations, regulatory, etc) so most of the team can focus on revenue.<p>I&#x27;ve decided to move to another country and that means I&#x27;ll have to leave this job. As much as I have enjoyed it, I would like to go solo &#x2F; entrepreneurial. Being a generalist with no specific skills, seems to be both an asset and a liability in such a transition<p>Has anyone made similar career changes with advice to share?",
