I do make use of them since I made a personal pact to use them in the future to help get things done. But it’s reached a point where I can rest on my laurels and leverage these tools daily yet there is the nagging feeling that another tool out there is better (and there sometimes is) or a new tool can 10x your productivity. The web has reached saturation levels of tooling and I feel overwhelmed by it all. Do you stick to a few tried &amp; tested tools and ignore <i>the new shiny</i> knowing you could be potentially more productive by signing up?",
