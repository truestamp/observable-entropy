But I think it happened earlier, MANY MANY Billions earlier - as these 3 huge cataclysms would have not allowed for the evolution of species, only disruption of species. - due to the fact the evolutionary track it obv billions of years, which required lots of water.<p>I believe the major impacts occurred billions ago, and the impacts helped crack-the-egg and create the tectonic plates.<p>TL;DR: Earth was a sphere that got impacted by tons of comets which created a shell of ice, then struck by asteroid swarms which created the oceans and panspermia asteroids (the asteroids that bring the elements that get pulverized into the constituants that when they spend billions of years in water with other elements - become life) planted some elements that allowed for life to kick-start.",
