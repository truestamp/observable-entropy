      "text": "Requiem for our “Dash Board Lights”!<p>Ironically, I was shopping for a streak at a new market yesterday, Farmer Joe’s, when I randomly picked up a package of ground pork, veal, and beef that was labeled good for MEATLOAF and meat balls not knowing that he had just passed away. I wish that he had, “Never done that” which is the only song that I ever knew most of the words to!<p>I’m glad I didn&#x27;t buy that package as I will never eat that recipe for now, not comfort food,  again! RIP, Mr. Master of the Clash, “ We will never have a soul singing any better than you did by all those damn Dash Board Lights”!",
