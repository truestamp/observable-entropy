      "text": "Plankton and Trees are at the bottom of the food chain. Sun&#x27;s energy across life time of solar system has fueled life on this planet by promoting growth of bottom of the food chain. Over the past 4.571 bn years, the Sun has produced X joules of energy. Of this 0.04696% has reached the earth. Of this 70% hits the earth&#x27;s surface. 66% warms the sea and 33% hits the land. Assuming 30% of land is flora then Sun has delivered 1.80E+40 Joules of Energy to forests and 1.20E+41 Joules to the ocean. etc , etc With some extra assumptions could work out how much of the Sun&#x27;s energy remains stored in the planet in the form or oil and coal.

      "text": "AutoInit is a weight initialization method that automatically adapts to different neural network architectures. It tracks the mean and variance of signals as they propagate through the network and initializes the weights at each layer to avoid exploding or vanishing signals. AutoInit can be used to improve performance of feedforward, convolutional, and residual networks; configured with different activation function, dropout, weight decay, learning rate, and normalizer settings; and applied to vision, language, tabular, multi-task, and transfer learning domains. The software package provides a simple wrapper that makes it possible to apply AutoInit to existing TensorFlow models as-is. We invite you to try it out and see if it can improve the performance of your neural network models!<p>For further details, see\n- GitHub repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cognizant-ai-labs&#x2F;autoinit\n- arXiv paper: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2109.08958<p>AutoInit is also available through the Cognizant AI Labs Software page, together with related software on estimating model uncertainty, multitasking, loss-function metalearning, decision making, and model management, at\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evolution.ml&#x2F;software<p>-- Garrett Bingham &amp; Risto Miikkulainen",
