The ideal user is a U.S. freelance writer.<p>I&#x27;m introducing it here on HN in hopes of attracting some intelligence discussion around how it compares to other similar products (you know the ones...) -- with special consideration given to the actual writing process, legalities, ethics, etc.<p>Thanks for reading!",
