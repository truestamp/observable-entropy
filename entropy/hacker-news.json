      "text": "I&#x27;m trying out a virtual monthly meetup for developers to talk about their experience hacking on hard software&#x2F;hardware projects like compilers, databases, emulators, operating systems, etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t need to be about a production system. It could be about a toy you&#x27;re working on. And you don&#x27;t need to be an expert you just need to be hacking on some cool project and willing to share with others!<p>I&#x27;ll give a talk on bootloader basics (I&#x27;m definitely not an expert, just been playing around). If I can get two more speakers for the first night next Thursday then it will be on.<p>More details here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;multiprocess.io&#x2F;hackernights&#x2F;",

      "text": "Context: I am a full stack developer that uses React to build simple UIs for technical simulations.<p>When working with React I spent a lot of time, also out of curiousity, on different solutions for certain problems (Think of Redux, MobX, and Recoil or React wrappers like React-Konva).\nWith Svelte I don&#x27;t do that. It seems most basic functionality is included in a thin layer of abstract above HTML, CSS, and JS (ref. The truth about Svelte by Rich Harris) and the Svelte standard library. From state management, reactivity, and with SvelteKit, to SSR and code splitting. For problems not covered is was, until now, always easy to use TS&#x2F;JS.<p>Question: is Svelte lean and pragmatic or is it missing something?<p>Note: I know React, use it, and like it (especially with hooks &amp; Redux-Toolkit).\nAs I am far from senior, maybe there are some complexities I am not seeing yet.",
