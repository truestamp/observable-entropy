They seemly got the data without my permission from a data broker.<p>I have previously asked Apple to remove the historical business details from Apple Maps via the built in feedback form and via email.<p>The place was removed for a short period of time but today I discovered the place is back and Apple are now publishing my mobile cell number on the same place marker!<p>Contacting tier 1 support is going to be comical at best. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to fix this?",
