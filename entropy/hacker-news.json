      "text": "I recently moved apartments and had a lot of stuff I wanted to get rid of.<p>I found the reselling process to be cumbersome – I needed to post the same info twice, to both Facebook and Craigslist. I had to renew the items so they don&#x27;t expire. I also had to reduce the item prices if they didn&#x27;t sell.<p>So I decided to do what any right minded overzealous, &quot;pragmatic&quot; software engineer does – instead of spending 10 minutes every few days reducing the prices and renewing the items, why not spend 3 weeks to build out a fully decked out Electron app that does all of the above automatically for you? Why not indeed...<p>In the end, it&#x27;s been a fun ride and I learned a lot. And actually! now it&#x27;s coming in handy as I&#x27;m finally starting to sell the backlog of items that I&#x27;ve accumulated.<p>Once I built it, I figured I&#x27;d offer it on gumroad, make a buck, why not... btw, the link is for a discounted version ($1 instead of $10) so that you lovely HN lot can try it out.<p>Curious if you all have thoughts &#x2F; feedback! Hopefully it will help you out on your next move too!",
