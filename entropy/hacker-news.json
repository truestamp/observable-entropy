      "text": "This morning I was fortunate to listen to a podcast with Armon Dadgar . Armon is a #Hashicorp CTO and co-founder. I found inspiration in his words to what we do https:&#x2F;&#x2F;privacybunker.io&#x2F;. The matter is that we are also an open-source security vendor and we are building a standard tool for every company to store customer records and with the highest level of security and privacy compliance: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;databunker.org&#x2F;.<p>So, according to Armon, the motivation for #Hashicorp was the following:<p>In a Pre #Oracle world, every company was building its own database.<p>Every company that manages any data had to build their own storage engine, their own query engine, their own everything.<p>This was a huge tax on the entire industry.<p>But once you have a set of vendors that provide standard SQL solutions, like Microsoft, Oracle, Sybase, etc... then you can build higher-level applications that consume the database.<p>For us (#Hashicorp), it felt like, where we are with our tools.<p>When we started, everyone was building their own platform, everyone was rolling its own approach to automation.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t there be a set of vendors who sell that for you and you just operate it rather than building it?<p>Original podcast: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;founderformula.sounder.fm&#x2F;episode&#x2F;33<p>About Databunker \nInstead of each company building its own data privacy and GDPR compliance solution, we provide a turnkey solution for this problem.<p>Ping me to know more:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;stremovsky",
