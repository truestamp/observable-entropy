Am i the only one who noticed this or can anyone confirm if there is a problem.<p>I am getting paranoid if there is a malware in my home network stack somewhere. I am running the tests from switzerland and have already analyized my pi.hole requests and dont see anything weird so far. I only use legal software and official windows&#x2F;os x devices.<p>Thanks a for your help.",
