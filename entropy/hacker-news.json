      "text": "Just saw this HN submission[0], about &#x27;G Suite legacy free&#x27; users have to start paying.<p>I&#x27;ve been using this for so many years now for our family of five members. To move away from this would be quite an effort.<p>However, I&#x27;ve been contemplating moving away from Gmail for quite some time now and this might be just the push I needed.<p>We hardly use Google drive or any of the other services so it should not be too painful. For all of our other services, we have been using Microsoft Office 365, which comes with Word, Excel, etc. Since this is a personal (family) plan [1] which we subscribe to, Microsoft does give an option for custom domains but only via GoDaddy [2].<p>Since the domain isn&#x27;t registered with GoDaddy, this isn&#x27;t an option. And the Microsoft 365 Business Basic Plan at $5&#x2F;user&#x2F;month doesn&#x27;t give any offline office products, so the option would be to go for the next tier of $8.25&#x2F;user&#x2F;month.<p>I would prefer to just move my email to some other provider since we already have Microsoft Outlook on all our machines.<p>It would also be a bonus to have a good online UI but that is not a priority as of now.<p>What alternatives are out there for people like us?<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29996432\n[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;microsoft-365&#x2F;p&#x2F;office-365-home&#x2F;cfq7ttc0k5dm?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&amp;rtc=1\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;get-a-personalized-email-address-in-microsoft-365-75416a58-b225-4c02-8c07-8979403b427b#:~:text=As%20a%20benefit%20of%20your,with%20your%20Outlook.com%20mailbox.",
