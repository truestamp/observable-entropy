      "text": "Hello HN,<p>It might appear as a strange question, but after failing so many interviews with Goog, FB, Aws and now Nordstrom - It&#x27;s what I&#x27;m about to conclude.  Now, I&#x27;ve a pool of interview questions. So, when I ask them those questions, they really don&#x27;t have credible answers. So, not sure, how they are judging me.<p>I&#x27;m starting to believe - if as an interviewee, you come across as smarter, the interviewer might feel threatened and may fear that - if they select you - then you might progress faster than them. So, it&#x27;s better for them to reject you.",
