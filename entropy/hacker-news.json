      "text": "I’m possibly in a position where, due to my manager changing offices, I might get tapped to step into his role (I’ve been told this directly by my manager’s manager). This is on an SRE team where there is a lot of work to do. Some good books I’ve had recommended to me when I was about to take on a team lead role at a different firm include Managing Humans, An Elegant Puzzle, and The Manager’s Path. I’ve read these over a while ago, but I’m a bit worried that I’m going to be in a bit over my head if I do step into this managerial role. Any advice, words of wisdom, or resources on suddenly becoming a first-time manager would be most appreciated!",
