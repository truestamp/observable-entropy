      "text": "Facebook&#x27;s Katran looked too scary (and I don&#x27;t do C++), so I thought I would investigate using XDP&#x2F;eBPF to redirect packets at high speed and Go to do the control plane work of health-checking backed servers and managing configuration. With luck the resulting binary should be easy to deploy by non-developers.<p>It&#x27;s still not mature, but seems to work. Code was written in a very exploratory manner, and I&#x27;m not a developer\nso it is quite shocking at the moment, but I aim to improve it. It is intended to be horizontally scalable with ECMP and has been tested on service providing 40Gb&#x2F;s with a single (hardware) node at ~30% CPU utilisation.",
