      "text": "Suppose the bubble bursts, and we enter into a recession or some sort of &quot;tech winter&quot; where the flow of dumb money ceases and it no longer becomes as feasible to job hop every 1-2 years, as it has been in Silicon Valley and other hot tech markets for the past decade. In that situation where tech workers end up staying at their companies for longer tenures, how will the shape of the industry change?<p>Will both workers and employers act less transactionally towards each other? Will there be greater loyalty from both sides? Will projects be planned out in a more long-term fashion, rather than chasing quick returns? Without the same hope for a quick exit, as in the past decade, will companies try to build more sustainably, rather than blitzscaling?",
