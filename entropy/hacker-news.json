But closing an issue can either be successful (usually through a PR) or unsuccessful and should remain red.<p>This change seems rushed and half-baked. Either leave it the way it was, or do it right.<p>Perhaps simply adding another button to the issue for &quot;Complete Issue&quot; or something would allow users to choose the resolution type. However, I already fear GitHub issues are getting too complex. There&#x27;s a reason I don&#x27;t use Jira for everything.",
