My coworker assured me they corrected this person, but nonetheless it&#x27;s still a major cause of concern for me.<p>I&#x27;d love to get some advice on what visibility changes those of you in this situation made (particularly ones for the office as we&#x27;re all heading back regularly quite soon).",
