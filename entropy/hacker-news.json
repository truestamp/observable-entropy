      "text": "My background:\nI never got a CS degree because I started programming when I was 12, building simple programs, games and websites. By the time I was college age, I already had a bit of experience and was working part time developing websites and doing IT support. I&#x27;ve now worked in &quot;tech&quot; for 18 years. I started as a &quot;web dev&quot; in an agency and moved on to full-stack software engineering in a few startups and then for bigger companies, including a FAANG company. I worked as a SWE, a Eng Manager, and then moved into more hybrid roles until I fully switched over to Product Manager about 7 years ago.<p>The problem:\nI&#x27;ve worked as a Technical Product Manager and Senior Product Manager for a few tech companies. The problem is that I&#x27;ve found Product Management to be interesting, but ultimately less challenging that Engineering, at least in the ways I enjoy being challenged. Most of my time is spent in meetings, coordinating other people&#x27;s ideas to other people&#x27;s work. I&#x27;d love to get back to actually building and engineering. I&#x27;m probably not the most brilliant SWE to ever live, but I&#x27;m also not horrible - I&#x27;ve contributed to a book on JS and have built quite a few successful sites and apps. I even keep pretty current by building hobby projects and side projects when I have time. My conversations with other engineers would lead me to believe I&#x27;m actually more up-to-date than many of them, at least on full-stack oriented languages and libraries.<p>When I talk to recruiters or inquire about positions, I get one of two responses.\n1) We require a CS degree \n2) Disbelief that I can work as a SWE (don&#x27;t have current skills)<p>Anyone have any advice on going back to Engineering from Product?",
