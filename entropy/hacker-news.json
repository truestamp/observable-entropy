      "text": "I&#x27;m a backend developer and my only frontend experience is with Tailwind and vanilla JS. I want to start working on a few side projects that I&#x27;ll eventually try to sell. I was looking for libraries or frameworks that would help me build these things, but I&#x27;m not going to go through the entire learning path of Vue and React, so I remembered working with jQuery and Bootstrap 7-8 years ago maybe and I&#x27;m considering using these.<p>Do you have any recent experiences with this stack? I see both of them have recent releases and they seem actively maintained. jQuery UI also has a ton of useful plugins. Should I start with this stack? Would you recommend something else?",
