      "text": "I need to get some concepts cleared because it looks to be something I could use right away for a project of mine. Bears mentioning that I come from the AWS world so I’m trying to get DOs from that perspective.<p>1. Is a durable object just a singleton JavaScript object which can write to a file?<p>2. Say I have a config JSON. Can a DO be used to update that json without worrying about one updater overwriting someone else’s updates? Basically, do DOs guarantee updates?<p>3. Is a DO in any way related to databases like DynamoDB or object stores like S3? I don’t think it is but if it is, how so?<p>4. Is a Cloudflare worker the same as a Lambda@Edge? So a DO is just a backend for (essentially) a bunch of Lambda@Edge functions?<p>Any help would be very appreciated? I’ve read the CF docs but they don’t give a conceptual overview of the product",
