I am not sure if I can rest &amp; vest in my company but assuming I can I wonder whether resting &amp; vesting would solve my burnout. At the current stock price I should probably interview &amp; rest and vest elsewhere.<p>1. What is life like after you are done resting &amp; vesting?<p>2. Does resting and vesting fix burnouts? I&#x27;d be on call every four weeks &amp; be attending meetings and doing some work on the non on call week.<p>3. I am the kind of person who likes doing things &amp; growing. Resting &amp; vesting makes me paranoid about future job prospects &amp; burning present time where I could be doing those things. Would I just lie in the interviews about my past few years and then work hard in the next job if I choose to?<p>I wonder if resting &amp; vesting would fix my burnout. I tend to feel guilty for not working while getting paid well(all things considered).",
