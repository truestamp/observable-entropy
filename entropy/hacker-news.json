      "text": "We are building a SaaS product aimed at local government customers. It solves a specific set of problems that are very domain specific and there is quite a bit of complexity involved in building the core product.<p>We offer a set of really awesome features that a lot of prospects want, and we do it in a much better way than our competitors.<p>Problem is, it&#x27;s government, which means a LOT of tenders and EVERY single tender has a section in the requirements a mile long where they effectively want us to include a full-featured reporting and business intelligence product... in addition to the actual product itself.<p>Obviously it would be insane for us to build this ourselves. It&#x27;s a whole product on its own that we don&#x27;t specialise in. So we want to buy &#x2F; implement something open source.<p>We&#x27;re looking at things like Bold BI, Toucan Toco, Cumul.io, etc. Almost all of them seem to need to ingest ALL of the data themselves, do crazy ass levels of manipulation and workflows on it, and then charge a boat load for us to be able to embed it in our app.<p>All we really want though is for a nice front-end that we can connect to a read-replica of our DB. We need people to be able to create queries, build tables and some basic graphs, present it in the UI on dashboards, and export it as different formats.<p>Thoughts?",
