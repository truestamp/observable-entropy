I understand the basics of processors (I built a basic one in school using Logisim and I&#x27;ve made a few emulators since then). But die photos don&#x27;t really mean anything to me. I don&#x27;t know if they even mean anything to other hardware engineers who didn&#x27;t build the particular chip.<p>But for fear of missing out I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s possible (and if there&#x27;s a good way) to learn to read die photos.<p>Any suggestions?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MOS_Technology_6502#Detailed_behavior",

      "text": "Is anyone using SQLite for server&#x2F;client web apps?<p>SQLite was not designed for the server&#x2F;client model. However, the simplicity and speed of SQLite makes it appealing for small-to-medium dynamic websites.<p>True client&#x2F;server databases like PostgreSQL bring with them advanced capabilities but also complexity in installation and maintenance.<p>Below are some extracts are from the SQLite FAQ: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;whentouse.html<p>---<p><i>Websites</i><p>...The SQLite website uses SQLite itself, of course, and as of this writing (2015) it handles about 400K to 500K HTTP requests per day, about 15-20% of which are dynamic pages touching the database. Dynamic content uses about 200 SQL statements per webpage. This setup runs on a single VM that shares a physical server with 23 others and yet still keeps the load average below 0.1 most of the time.<p><i>Server-side database</i><p>...Developers report that SQLite is often faster than a client&#x2F;server SQL database engine in this scenario. Database requests are serialized by the server, so concurrency is not an issue. Concurrency is also improved by &quot;database sharding&quot;: using separate database files for different subdomains. For example, the server might have a separate SQLite database for each user, so that the server can handle hundreds or thousands of simultaneous connections, but each SQLite database is only used by one connection.<p>---<p>So, can SQLite work with dynamic sites that require writing to the database for many users at the same time?<p>- Has anyone had success doing this? How did you achieve it?<p>- Conversely, did anyone ditch SQLite and adopt a different client&#x2F;server database e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL etc?",
