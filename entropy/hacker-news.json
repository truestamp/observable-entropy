The answer was no.<p>Then I asked:<p>&gt;How about if I sync one copy of the Ethereum block chain (about 350 GB of data) to\nmy server without allowing it to be publicly accessible - is that allowed?<p>and also whether they allow crypto applications at all.  Hetzner support answered<p>&gt; Dear ladies and gentlemen<p>&gt; We do not allow any crypto related applications.<p>Hetzner&#x27;s public documentation only seems to forbid mining applications, which they started doing in May on all servers including mining.<p>There is also this Reddit post from about 1 month back that indicated they forbid crypto applications on cloud servers<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ethstaker&#x2F;comments&#x2F;qwteod&#x2F;be_careful_with_hetzner_any_crypto_activity_is&#x2F;<p>but it appeared that did not apply to dedicated servers.<p>Has any one else on HN received a recent response from Hetzner regarding what is permitted on dedicated servers with respect to crypto applications?",
