I can understand if this parcel were somehow drastically outside the ISP service area, but I am certain that isn&#x27;t the case as I have personal friends within .5 miles that have 1-gig service.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t the ISP benefit from investing by expanding their available service, given most of the lines (AFAIK) around here are aerial, pole-to-home.<p>Anyone have advice or ideas on how to get reliable fiber to my community?",
