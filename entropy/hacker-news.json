      "text": "I love the M1 chips. I use a 2021 MacBook both personally and professionally. My job is DevOps work.<p>But the migration to ARM is proving to be quite a pain point. Not being able to just do things as I would on x86-64 is damaging my productivity and creating a necessity for horrible workarounds.<p>As far as I know none of our pipelines yet do multi-arch Docker builds, so everything we have is heavily x86-64 oriented. VirtualBox is out of the picture because it doesn&#x27;t support ARM. That means other tools that rely on it are also out of the picture, like Molecule. My colleague wrote a sort of wrapper script that uses Multipass instead but Multipass can&#x27;t do x86-on-ARM emulation.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Lima to create virtual machines which works quite well because it can do multiple architectures. I haven&#x27;t tested it on Linux though, and since it claims to be geared towards macOS that worries me. We are a company using a mix of MacBooks and Linux machines so we need a tool that will work for everyone.<p>The virtualisation situation on MacBooks in general isn&#x27;t great. I think Apple introduced Virtualization.framework to try and improve things but the performance is actually worse than QEMU. You can try enabling it in the Docker Desktop experimental options and you&#x27;ll notice it gets more sluggish.<p>Ugh. Again, I love the performance and battery life, but the fragmentation this has created is a nightmare.<p>How is your experience so far? Any tips&#x2F;tricks?",

      "text": "Hey HN! We’ve created Mood Surf, a discovery engine to explore topics that intrigue you. We miss the days you could stumble upon weird, wonderful, human-authored pages on the Web. Twitter threads are similarly niche and personal but so much good content gets lost in the algorithmic timeline.<p>So we built Mood Surf to explore the conversations that you might not have found otherwise. Click “Shuffle” to jump into a random corner topic space. Click “Dive Deeper” to go down the rabbit hole of similar threads.<p>Technical details:<p>We ran graph analysis on the tech&#x2F;startup-adjacent subset of Twitter graph to find the top contributors within a given niche. We extracted each user’s threads and embedded them using sentence transformers [0]. The “dive deeper” functionality is powered by approximate nearest neighbor lookup using Pinecone [1]<p>We hope you like the product — share with us any feedback you have!<p>— The folks at Re:Search<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbert.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbert.net&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinecone.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinecone.io&#x2F;</a>",
