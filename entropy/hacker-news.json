I can handle that, but only if I feel consistently well-rested; otherwise, I get headaches and heart palpitation, and I can&#x27;t manage.<p>I have been trying to develop a methodology to get as much rest as possible. Sleep is the best solution, but it&#x27;s often elusive or inconsistent despite my best efforts, and I can&#x27;t depend on it to feel fully rested every day.<p>My current approach is first sleeping as much as I can, taking naps when I can. Otherwise, meditate for around 10 minutes, stretch, light exercise, cool showers, eat low glycemic index foods, avoid drugs (weed, alcohol, nicotine), dry eye drops.<p>It feels like an oxymoron, but there must be a way to feel well-rested even during times of high stress? It feels backward to go for a Monster or Redbull and crash at the expense of your health instead of developing a system for consistent energy.<p>What can a developer do to avoid feeling tired and promote a sense of restfulness in the short and long term?<p>What do you personally do to maintain yourself for consistent output of work in different or unexpected contexts?",
