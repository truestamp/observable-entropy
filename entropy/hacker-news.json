The songs span a period starting from 1940s all the way to 2000s.<p>Backstory: I had some ideas on analyzing bollywood lyrics. To my surprise there wasn&#x27;t a good dataset available suitable for such analysis. I didn&#x27;t want to scrape some lyrics website. Fortunately I found giitayan.com and their datasets, which I have used to produce a single csv file.<p>If you have any fun ideas on analyzing these lyrics, I am all ears.",
