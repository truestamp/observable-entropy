      "text": "When I first read something using the term &quot;doomscrolling&quot; or &quot;scroll of doom&quot;, my brain formed an understanding of it that focuses on the &quot;scrolling&quot;, characterized by doom, as in being doomed to an eternal never-ending scrolling through something. Just like what the modern web afflicts onto its users.<p>Texts that used the term seemed to make sense with that definition.<p>These days &quot;doomscrolling&quot; is making big media headlines, and the definition media uses seems to focus on &quot;doom&quot; as in browsing bad news, and the &quot;scrolling&quot; part does not even fit the context. At least assuming simply scrolling would not only provide unwanted (unconsciously desired) bad news, but &quot;doomscrolling&quot; according to that definition would require some slightly more active form of consumption, like following links that fit the theme or explicit searches.<p>Was my understanding wrong in the first place, or is it a case of &quot;hacker&quot; once more? What is your definition?",

      "text": "Hey HN! I just released weron, a P2P VPN that uses WebRTC for transport which I&#x27;ve been working on for the last couple of months. It can create both layer 2&#x2F;Ethernet and layer 3&#x2F;IP overlay networks, and the underlying transport layer can be easily embedded to write your own P2P apps with Go. Compared to for example Tailscale, WireGuard and ZeroTier, its much harder to block on a network level and also significantly easier to set up, while not sacrifing much performance.<p>I&#x27;d love to get your feedback :)",
