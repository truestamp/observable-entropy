      "text": "I&#x27;m using Mermaid, Excalidraw and PlantUML diagrams to explain and document what I&#x27;m working on and they work great and are a lot better than screens of prose, but I&#x27;ve become aware that something is missing: motion.<p>Animation brings a whole lot more to explanations, making simple explanations of how request coalescing works easy to understand, token simulations [0] through to helping explain concepts like Fresnel lenses [1]. Embedding them into GitHub READMEs, tweets and documentation would be awesome.<p>I found Excalidraw Claymate [2] but the stop motion approach with no tweening support makes it painful to create animations where circles move from place to place. There&#x27;s also Manim [3] but I think this is more for maths.<p>Adobe Flash used to be the go-to; what do you reach for when you want to illustrate a concept with an animated diagram?<p>0. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bpmn-io&#x2F;bpmn-js-token-simulation<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30576688<p>2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dai-shi&#x2F;excalidraw-claymate<p>3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ManimCommunity&#x2F;manim",

      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m Eric and I&#x27;m the founder and lead developer of Prepform.<p>A high-quality education helped me pursue my interests and achieve my goals. I started Prepform so students of all backgrounds have access to the same kind of education.<p>I grew up in Southern California, surrounded by dozens of SAT prep programs, and I swear I must have gone to all of them. Different programs followed different styles and techniques, but the strategy they shared was to create a study plan and review mistakes.<p>A study plan is\ntaking a diagnostic test,<p>setting a target score,<p>creating a study schedule,<p>identifying mistakes, and finally<p>reviewing those mistakes.<p>I wanted to take this structure and optimize it with machine learning, while accounting for elements of human learning and memory.\nI&#x27;m a big fan of SuperMemo, a memorization technique developed by Piotr Wozniak, where you review material just as you&#x27;re about to forget it. Cognitive psychology tells us human forgetting follows a pattern, but Piotr quantified this behavior to identify the precise moment forgetting happens.<p>The goal was to build on his research with AI and tailor it to not only test prep but to the individual student, and make it the engine of the study plan.<p>The result is Blended Prep, which guides students to internalize knowledge rather than memorize material, and gives them the best chance to ace their next exam.<p>I&#x27;m so excited to share this with the HN community, and would love to know what you think. You can try it out at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prepform.com. Thanks for reading.",

      "text": "VonNewmann&#x27;s architecture has been around for quite a while - and as a software engineer I am very grateful for that, don&#x27;t get me wrong. On the other hand, new programming languages keep popping up every year - okay, I&#x27;m being a bit dramatic here.<p>Is there any interesting project or study in the computer architecture space you would recommend? Particularly one where it could eventually compete with VonNeumann&#x27;s for the mainstream or more specifically to compete for personal computing in large scale?<p>My thoughts on this come from this paper - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;359576.359579 and this video from Bell Labs back in the day - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;tc4ROCJYbm0",
