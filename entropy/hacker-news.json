Occasionally I&#x27;d copy files over from my computer to one of the drives and occasionally I&#x27;d mirror the data on one drive to the other. Also wondering if I should just re-use some existing 2.5&quot; drives I have from old laptops or if it&#x27;s more prudent to purchase a new drive that might be manufactured with long-term durability &#x2F; stability in mind.",
