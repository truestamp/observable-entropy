      "text": "I am looking for a collaborative infrastructure documentation repository where I can (easily) document infrastructure (eg. servers, IPs, OS versions, network configuration, access credentials, customer contact details) so that the support engineer on-call handling an incident can look up the customer&#x27;s infrastructure.<p>Context: one of my teams manages infrastructure for customers, eg. installing Linux in VMs, managing storage, restarting servers, upgrading the OS etc. The per-installation incident count is low, so support engineers don&#x27;t spend enough time with systems to &quot;get used&quot; to them, but total incident count over all installations is high enough to make me think I oughta do something about it. Integrated monitoring&#x2F;management automation isn&#x27;t an option unless the customer pays for it, which they usually don&#x27;t. Customer installations are highly individualised, too.",
