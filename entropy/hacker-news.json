      "text": "Which software do you use as an emergency backup right before doing a risky operation (such as an upgrade) ?<p>I am going through the pain of restoring my files after a bad error on my part : I used déjà-dup (the default with Ubuntu 20.04.4) to back up the default home folder.<p>Unfortunately, my update broke everything and I lost access to my session. I hoped that deja-dup would allow me to restore from the live CD, but found out that I need the same computer name and username, so I had to reinstall everything before being able to restore.<p>This seems inconvenient, and I don&#x27;t understand why it is the default behavior.<p>What are you using to do your backups ? Have you felt the same frustration I&#x27;m facing ?",
