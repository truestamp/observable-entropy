      "text": "Following the SCOTUS Robb decision last week, there&#x27;s a lot of talk about the possibilty of medication-by-mail becoming a dominant means of abortion is those US states that pass laws to ban or severely limit the procedure.<p>For this this to be possible and safe will require a website somewhat akin to Silk Road, but unlike SR, one built without the ego-driven errors of its founder. Presumably onion routing, ex-USA hosting, a network of US-based individuals functioning as mailers in abortion-legal jurisdictions and much else will be necessary.<p>What would the full technological scope of such a site look like? I am assuming one impervious to anything except the NSA or its equivalent (for the time being, the NSA is not going to assist states investigating such a system, though that could change in the future).<p>Who should build it?",
