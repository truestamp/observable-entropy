      "text": "Hi. \nI am avid Linux user, but work is sending a powerful laptop with windows on it. I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a little windows pet to play with&#x2F;use properly. Other than registry changes, opensource privacy tools such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;farag2&#x2F;Sophia-Script-for-Windows\nand a few cosmetic add-ons, what should I know about to change it the way I wish?\nAn example I am looking for is more advanced ways to make the installation footprint smaller. It&#x27;ll take the whole drive, how might i reduce it to single digit GB? I&#x27;d prefer built-in tools or neat scripts if they&#x27;re out there.\nbest",
