      "text": "What low-cost(as low as possible) tech stack(both hardware and software) is available to develop and distribute eXtended Reality(XR) educational simulation apps(with hand tracking) that can be affordable to students&#x2F;schools from non-affluent areas(even from developing&#x2F;under-developed countries)?<p>On the software front, Godot Engine targeting Android handsets could be one option for developing the apps. But I think this will not be straight forward as some porting will be required to make Godot XR work on low-cost Android mobile phones. What other options are available?<p>Also, on the hardware front what XR headset would you recommend that is very low-cost?",
