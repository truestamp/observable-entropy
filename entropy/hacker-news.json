      "text": "Hi all,<p>I&#x27;m interested in anything (computer) science &#x2F; mathematics related, however, I&#x27;m a Software Engineer and would not consider myself a scientist or mathematician.<p>I currently have subscriptions for &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; but I won&#x27;t renew my subscriptions for neither of them. Most of the articles in Nature are too specialized for me, only the first part of the magazine is readable, where the gist of the content is presented. CACM on the other side seems a bit too high-level and I have the impression it&#x27;s mainly about A.I. and inclusiveness these days (nothing against these topics, just don&#x27;t want to read about it all the time).<p>Any recommendations?",
