      "text": "Hey all,<p>Usually after I finish work, I&#x27;ve got about an hour or so to fill in before I go about making dinner for the family.<p>In this time I usually desire to have something to &quot;mentally chew on&quot; - I want to keep my mind occupied in some regards; and I usually desire to do something like have a chess or go game (wife isn&#x27;t interested in playing) or othersuch.<p>I think most of the people I talk to use this time to doom scroll the internet, which is something I want to break free from (most of the time I&#x27;m doom scrolling HN) - I&#x27;d like to label the time &quot;fruitful&quot; in some way, and I usually find scrolling the internet is not often producing fruit.<p>I&#x27;m a software programmer, and if I could, I&#x27;d use this time to work on my own projects, but I don&#x27;t want to have to look at screens more; I&#x27;d really love to be away from the screens but still have something to mentally occupy my mind.<p>This is a good space for a hobby of some sort, perhaps, so I&#x27;m wondering whats some hobby like things you do after work, if you do anything at all?",

I can&#x27;t believe business can operate like this. I&#x27;m currently trying to rebuild a critical PC as it freezes up all the time. Debugging the issue is a nightmare.<p>Our servers regularly stop working, some interaction between active directory and DNS. I haven&#x27;t been able to get to the bottom of it. Every second Sunday the server requires a reboot else the entire network doesn&#x27;t seem to work.<p>This didn&#x27;t happen with Linux things just worked or you knew why they didn&#x27;t.<p>Is my experience typical or just bad luck?",
