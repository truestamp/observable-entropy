Recently I discovered a number of instances where the repository was cloned, git history was blown away, and the source is hosted under a different account and repository name. In most cases the license is preserved, but I’m curious the ethics of not forking and rewriting history such that there is zero link to the original work.",

AI chatbots that never let you speak to a human.<p>The only possible way to get real support in 2022 is to have an enormous &quot;megaphone&quot;. If you&#x27;re an influencer you&#x27;re able to make a big stink and have someone important at the company pop up and solve your issue within minutes.<p>And even then you&#x27;re often still stuck. HN got this guy&#x27;s Amazon issue escalated, but the higher-ranking person was still stuck in drone script mode and ultimately proved useless:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigmessowires.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;25&#x2F;amazon-pay-part-2-2300-lost-and-found&#x2F;<p>I just had my bank account closed because I bought something online and it turned out the company was a fraud (my bad research). I asked the bank for a chargeback and they refused. I looked up a couple of management employees contact details and texted them, and they seemed supportive at first, but then they closed my account for contacting their staff outside the online support channel.<p>I think from now 2022 onwards, anything financial you do online must be dealt with an attitude that you might just lose everything and never get a resolution.<p>Am I wrong?",
