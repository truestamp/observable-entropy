      "text": "Google Maps has all sorts of street mapping issues in my neighborhood. A new development has been built with new roads. Google doesn&#x27;t have those roads. They have an old road showing that got moved. They have now mislabeled the road I live on to be one in the new development. Now tons of moving trucks and other traffic is incorrectly being routed down my street. These vehicles are getting lost because the street they are looking for doesn&#x27;t even connect to our roundabout street. I have tried submitting countless data issue, missing places, wrong data requests via Google Maps online reporting method. Nothing is happening. Does ANYONE know a better way? If I had the time and money I&#x27;d consult with a lawyer and send a cease and desist letter as they are sending traffic down our PRIVATELY maintained road.",
