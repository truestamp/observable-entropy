It&#x27;s a cool article with a lot of dynamic visual content that moves, shifts and refocuses as you scroll, what I believe the NYTimes calls an &quot;interactive story.&quot;<p>Is anyone trying to archive articles like this for the medium&#x2F;long term? I can imagine a static video of the article, but to really capture the original experience, you&#x27;d need something like a Docker for the typical 2022-era  browser that was meant to run the story.<p>Does archive.org have the best solution to this problem right now? Who else is working on it and what are they doing?",
