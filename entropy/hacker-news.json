      "text": "Clever people of HN, please provide your feedback.<p>I recently left where I was issued NSO over 2.5 years of working with them. This made up part of my salary.<p>After leaving I have 3 months to purchase the options.<p>Prior to leaving I tried to purchase the options and was told the window was closed, I have followed up again and have received no feedback just yet, I assume the window is still closed. Before leaving i received clarification that the window being closed would not lengthen the period I had to purchase.<p>What can I do if the window is closed through the duration of the 3 months after leaving? Do I have any leg to stand on?",
