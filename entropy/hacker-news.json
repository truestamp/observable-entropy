I used to be a developer and I am currently a member of a support team for a biggish company.<p>I have recently been getting a lot of exposure to admin level security work like dealing with Active Directory&#x2F; SSL etc. I am not sure if becoming an expert in this field would pay off long term. I have read from other posts on HN that security field pays well but its a vast field with many diverse roles and it is not clear what these roles do and what they get paid.<p>I will be extremely grateful if someone can throw some light on which security related roles &#x2F; skills are desirable to have and would make one attractive to FAANG companies.",
