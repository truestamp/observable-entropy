      "text": "When Netflix first started out, it was an aggregator of movies and shows not unlike Spotify for music is today. Originally, the biggest challenge was the technology parts of the business. But today, most of Netflix’s (and all of the competitors) challenges are not technology problems, but media creation problems - creating hit media. Meanwhile, all of the other production companies (HBO, Peacock, Disney) have caught up, while other technology entrants (Hulu, Apple TV) are likewise focusing on production of original content to stay competitive.<p>This is also starting to happen with Podcasts (Spotify as the leading example).<p>But why hasn’t it happened for music, proper? I think Jay-Z’s Tidal tried this but they weren’t successful. But Sony Music Group, Universal Music Group, etc all have huge catalogs of music, and there is a trend of artists selling their catalogs to these companies. What’s to stop them from pulling back their licensing and launching their own app competing with Spotify? And conversely, why hasn’t Spotify moved into music production in the same way that it has moved into Podcasts? (Caveat being that they tried at some point with generic beats and piano and atmospheric music production, but those knockoffs fell flat and felt hidden).",
