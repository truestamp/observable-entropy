      "text": "I have worked in the same general field, for the same general customer set, for my entire career. I’m comfortable, paid well, and work relatively stress free.<p>The issue is that over my career I have built many different tools to accomplish various “required” tasks. Yet, if I’m being honest, only 2 of them have ever actually been put to minor use. The rest were shelved for reasons out of my control (but not for a lack of capability, completeness, etc..)<p>I’m 10 - 15 years out from retirement and I’m annoyed that I can’t point to anything tangible that has had any impact on anyone.<p>I am trying to figure out if I’m lying to myself, by thinking I’ll find the proverbial greener grass somewhere else.<p>With that, do you find your job fulfilling?",
