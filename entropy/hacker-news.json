      "text": "I&#x27;m early in my software career(24y&#x2F;o) still and have a good amount of free time. I&#x27;m unsure where to start with bettering my career. I know the basics of programming(data structures) transfer to almost any job. So I&#x27;ll likely continue with that in Leetcode. But what else should I be doing? Focus on getting better at technologies I already know? Learning&#x2F;exploring new skills? Focus on current job skills and hope they transfer to the next job? I know there isn&#x27;t a definitive answer but wondering what some of you found success in early in your career. Thanks",
