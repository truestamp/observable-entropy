      "text": "Hello everyone, \nI did my master&#x27;s in IT and have a few years of experience as a database&#x2F;system admin. My undergrad was in CS, but tbh I am not very good at programming. During my MS, I took a few DS classes (statistical learning, regression analysis, ML, data mining and knowledge discovery, big data management) and felt passionate about DS and ML. I have also taken the deep learning specialization on Coursera. I have also done some &quot;basic&quot; projects (most of the class projects).  However, I still don&#x27;t feel comfortable in ML, especially the programming part. Also, I have not built anything that I could showcase my skills. \nWhat would you recommend I should do now? Do you think I should take some programming&#x2F;data, science classes?",
