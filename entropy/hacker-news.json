This never happened, I ended up writing a lot of code, and no agreement was ever formulated.<p>I got sick of it, and bailed. Now they&#x27;re telling me that I need to give them the code.<p>I live in Canada, and no idea how to reply. I donn&#x27;t have resources or time to put towards this argument.<p>What should I do?

In my day job I work with iOS and Swift as a junior engineer. Even though I am performing, I am not really «getting it» in the same ways I would understand things with C#. I have less experience with C# and .NET, but when I am exposed to it I typically understand what is going on much faster.<p>It might be because many books outside iOS actually tells you what is going on from the ground up and iOS books are «oh don’t worry about that stuff just know…». I feel the approach to other systems are more direct and hands on, while anything Apple is obfuscated a bit.<p>Have any of you had similar experiences? For reference I have experience with Swift, C, C++, C#, Java, Python mostly and C# resonnates the most even though I can accomplish more in Swift.",
