      "text": "Throwaway account for what I think are obvious reasons.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this startup for about two years now in earnest.  It&#x27;s a news app&#x2F;platform -- I don&#x27;t want to go into too much detail for fear of identifying it -- but it&#x27;s more than just the usual aggregator.  We&#x27;ve started to forge partnerships, even sold some sponsorships, and built more than an MVP.<p>I won&#x27;t sugarcoat saying by we&#x27;re a breakaway success, but we also haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that we <i>arent</i> on the right track.  My cofounder and I have deep experience in this sector, working for the very incumbents we want to disrupt.  At this point, we really think what&#x27;s holding us back is scale -- we need to bring on reporters&#x2F;editors&#x2F;etc to actually have enough content to bring in an audience, but we keep finding investors who want to see traction.<p>I&#x27;m still very confident in the business, and that we can succeed if we could get a real start.  I&#x27;m also afraid that for every week that we&#x27;ve launched but don&#x27;t grow, we become a bigger red flag for future investors.<p>We&#x27;re not in a position to raise enough from friends &amp; family, and haven&#x27;t had much luck yet with accelerators -- same basic feedback as the investors.  I&#x27;m stuck, and struggling.  I see all these Twitter comments about how much capital is out there, and see all these other companies raising, and cannot help but to feel frustrated.<p>To other founders who have gone through this -- would love to hear how you&#x27;ve overcome this seemingly insurmountable block, both emotionally and financially.",
