      "text": "I recently bought an upgraded HP laptop from Amazon. The memory and storage were upgraded by Oydisen Electronics. \nAfter 2 weeks of use, the laptop shut off. In restarting, an HP screen let me know that no OS was detected. I worked through some HP troubleshooting steps and the laptop could not detect an SSD. I tried taking the back panel off to see if the SSD had somehow come loose, but it is glued to something in the middle, and forcing it off would mean breaking the back panel and maybe the motherboard if that is what it is glued to. \nI asked the seller about this and they just told me to return it, but I had already saved so many personal files to the drive when it disappeared, and I do not feel comfortable returning it like this.\nI have tried Linux&#x2F;Windows USB installations, but neither could detect any drives (after USB).\nIt seems that I will be taking the $1000 hit on this. Amazon refuses to refund me without a return, and returning it would mean submitting my financials, health records, passwords, etc., to the mercy of Oydisen Electronics. \nCould this be a self-destructing laptop by design of Oydisen Electronics? It certainly looks that way to me.",

      "text": "Honest question<p>I know Putin likely has plans beyond eastern Ukraine.<p>But in Western media there seems to be no possibility of Donbas being more suited to Russia alignment. (which actually might be right, based on my very limited understanding)<p>I know that&#x27;s a RIDICULOUS statement.  Why should any country ever give way to violence just because parts of it might be more suited to another?<p>But the alternative is freaking war, and it&#x27;s looking very scary.  And the alternative for Ukraine is gruelling never ending separatism.<p>Have we just ruled out too soon a possibility of Russia stopping at Donbas?<p>But similarly, I have no idea why Putin would care so much about just Donbas, enough to inflict sanctions on himself and ruin his gas export plans.  I don&#x27;t believe for one second he cares for the people of Donbas to that extent. So again there is more going on than what I can understand from our media.",
