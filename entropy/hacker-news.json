      "text": "It&#x27;s been 2 years since Covid. We&#x27;ve seen many famous companies (Coinbase, Shopify, I think Facebook as well) announce they&#x27;re turning into remote first &#x2F; remote friendly companies. This is of course also accompanied with aggressive hiring all over the world.<p>However, I cannot say I feel any effect as of yet as a software dev living in a major high cost tech hub. In fact it seems salaries are only going higher and higher.\nNot only that, the number of open tech jobs still seems extremely high everywhere in the developed world. In fact, dare I say, it has never been better to be in tech than today.\nWhere is the big offshoring wave some of us were expecting? Is it yet to come or were some of us overestimating its effects?",
