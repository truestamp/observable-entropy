That is a number with almost 10 thousand digits. Could these sha1 collision attack strategies be used to cut down on the number of combinations we&#x27;d have to comb through to find the matching 4 KiB of binary that original produced the hash?<p>Either way, I&#x27;m interested to learn more about how this works.
