      "text": "Hi all!<p>We’re Collin and Sarah from Stable — a virtual address + mailbox for business. Today we’re excited to share that Stable is launching Stable Reminders (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usestable.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;reminders)!<p>What are Stable Reminders?<p>Stable Reminders are email notifications sent directly to your inbox before important federal and state filings are due. These reminders are customized to your entity type and state(s) you&#x27;ve registered to do business in. It’s nothing fancy, just reminders, and all for free.<p>Why are we launching this?<p>We have digitized a lot of physical mail — our core product is a virtual address + mailbox for business. Throughout this, we’ve been consistently surprised by the number of businesses that get notified and fined for missed filing deadlines via physical mail.<p>We think it’s anxiety-inducing to receive unknown mail from a government agency, frustrating to pay fines for simple oversight, and generally outdated to receive physical mail in the first place.<p>We built Stable Reminders to make tracking and acting on filing deadlines a better experience!<p>With Stable Reminders, we hope your business can avoid penalties &amp; late fees imposed by federal and state governments, ensure that good standing is maintained, and gain peace of mind + instill confidence that filing deadlines will be met (especially if you aren’t relying on a corporate lawyer).<p>Currently support jurisdictions: Federal, Delaware, California (If you’d like to see support for other jurisdictions please leave a comment or email us at collin.pham@useStable.com)<p>What do you think?<p>Does this sound useful to you? If it does, you can sign up with your email here (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usestable.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;reminders). If it doesn’t, we’d love to hear why in the comments.<p>If you’d like to learn more or have any questions, leave a comment or shoot us an email at collin.pham@useStable.com",
