      "text": "When people use the phrase in pop media, they usually mean something like &quot;recommendation engine&quot;. Sure, it probably has some sort of novel algorithm involved, but you could just as well call it a &quot;program&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t sufficiently describe what you think you&#x27;re describing.<p>It&#x27;s a very broad and basic term, and now lay people are given the impression that the word means some sort of AI. They sometimes even half-jokingly talk about &quot;The Algorithm&quot; as some sort of mystical force.<p>I&#x27;m shocked that I&#x27;m basically the only computer person I know of who complains about this. No math people either! And at this point tech people seem to be misusing it.<p>I know this is a waste of energy and &quot;algorithm&quot; will go the way of &quot;literally&quot; but I don&#x27;t want to go down without a fight.",
