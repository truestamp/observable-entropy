      "text": "I&#x27;m pretty disillusioned with the corporate rat race...I naively took on some additional managerial&#x2F;strategic responsibilities assuming I&#x27;d get a promotion, but I&#x27;m finding that even if I did get the promotion, I&#x27;m not enjoying my current work as much, as I&#x27;m far less hands-on. I know I can provide value--I&#x27;ve got industry-specific domain expertise and I can write high-quality software.<p>One of the projects I&#x27;ve recently been managing is the outsourcing of some programming work--work outsourced to a team of &quot;professional programmers&quot; but with no domain expertise. I think I could have done better myself in terms of code quality, but even if I had, I know I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten paid as much since I&#x27;m an employee. I&#x27;d like to capture that value myself instead of dealing with an OK bonus and sub-inflationary raise.<p>I&#x27;ve been considering trying my hand going solo, offering my skills on a contract basis. But I&#x27;ve never done this, and it&#x27;s a big change for me. Ideally, I could start with my current employer as a client.<p>How often is this done? What steps should I take and what should I consider? Any resources that you&#x27;d recommend?",
