      "text": "So I&#x27;m looking to boost my presence online and part of that plan includes making a personal site with a simple blog, list of personal projects, and maybe a resume. I haven&#x27;t needed to do web development in a number of years, back in the day I&#x27;d just do wordpress, but that seems a bit heavy for my simple needs. Not to mention I&#x27;d Also like to try something outside the php world. So I thought I&#x27;d ask:<p>It&#x27;s the year 2021, what framework&#x2F;web-stack would you pick if you had to make a personal website for yourself today?",
