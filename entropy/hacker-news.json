      "text": "I was an early employee of a company that closed their $150M series E in May. I&#x27;d like to liquidate some of the shares I own instead of waiting another 2-3 years for a possible IPO. I understand there are secondary markets that broker these deals but I haven&#x27;t had any luck with them. Can I find an interested buyer myself and skip the wait&#x2F;brokerage fee? If my former employer and its investors have a tendency to exercise its ROFR, can I just approach them directly with an offer to buy some of my shares?",
