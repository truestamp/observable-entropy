      "text": "Hi everyone, our early stage startup just raised a first round, currently for 12-18 months of runway. Like the US, inflation is hitting Europe with ~7.5% p.a., salary expectations in job interviews with newly grads are already up 15-20% compared to last year.<p>After a long time of bootstrapping, &quot;just spend faster&quot; is not a viable option to prevent inflation from shrinking that pile of cash we&#x27;re sitting on – we&#x27;re both culturally and operationally not yet ready to open the floodgates: hiring the right people and building the team takes time, and we also haven&#x27;t figured out which sales channels are the right ones to scale. Our business is highly cyclical, so we need certain periods of the year to figure stuff out while improving product and ramping up capacity in the mean time.<p>How do you fellow founders manage this situation? Do your companies hold assets to hedge inflation risks? Do you think about putting clauses into contracts with investors to adjust future payments to inflation? Are there any good reads on cash management for startups in general?",

      "text": "I graduate high school this year, and I&#x27;d like to keep in touch with my classmates. Since just 15 of us spent almost every class together because of the program we took, we&#x27;re very tight-knit and I&#x27;d like to think we want to keep in touch with each other in the next few years, even if we don&#x27;t communicate regularly.<p>There is a convenient 5-letter .com domain that aptly describes the program at our school specifically, so it would cost maybe $100 to register it for the next 10 years and toss a comment section and photo album onto it. I don&#x27;t want to have to teach everyone how to make an account, etc on another service (plus I can&#x27;t guarantee everyone will remember their password, or that it will still be running) so a comment section might be ideal.<p>If I don&#x27;t act quickly, someone&#x27;s gonna make a Facebook group..<p>Can you think of a better way to allow a group of people to stay in contact with each other, planning for the long-term future?<p>Other things I&#x27;ve considered: Social media group (not long term), email thread (push notification style might stop people from updating it), group chat (ditto).",
