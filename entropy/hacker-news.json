      "text": "This thread on the front page, &quot;Anyone making a living building desktop applications?&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30027925) hit me pretty hard, especially since I&#x27;m currently looking for a new job and struggling to decide what I want to do with life. Of course there are just as many projects that never break a hundred bucks, but seeing all these figures of hundreds to thousands per month on straightforward, no-nonsense software sales makes me feel like I&#x27;m wasting my potential.<p>But the dissonance part is that I&#x27;m standing on mountains upon mountains of free software, to the point that it feels difficult to justify selling any of the measly stuff I write. I don&#x27;t think any other industry is like this. Linux is free. SQLite is free, it&#x27;s even public domain. My feelings about SQLite are strong enough that I wrote about it last year (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voussoir.net&#x2F;writing&#x2F;sqlite_what_a_hunk). I can&#x27;t remember the last time I paid for software and I don&#x27;t know how I could charge someone else for software without feeling like a big poser.<p>I already know the technical answer, which is that people will pay for something if it adds value to their life. So yeah, I get that. But the idea that my stupid code is worth money when I don&#x27;t even pay for the stuff that improves <i>my</i> life is difficult to reconcile. You can visit my profile to see what I make.<p>What are your thoughts?<p>Thanks",
