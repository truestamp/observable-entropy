      "text": "Let&#x27;s say that I&#x27;m a software designer and builder and can handle all the technical side of a SaaS company alone in the early stages, but of course in this case I&#x27;ll need a co-founder to secure sales and acquire customers. To be clear I&#x27;ll attend all the meetings with the customers in the early stages, but I cannot do that alone because it has to be professional and more &quot;majestic&quot; (I&#x27;m not sure if this is the right use of the word).\nAlso we need to show up and market our products so we may attend public events or, for example, talks about our product on the radio and so on.<p>I know that the following question has no right answer and it depends on the context, but I&#x27;m open to hear different answers for different scenarios:\nHow much equity do you think should I pay for a co-founder like this?",
