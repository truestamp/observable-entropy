When you have free video uploads, you get low quality advertising funded content, when you have free search, you get SEO blogspam.<p>Microtransactions for everything would fix the internet. It should cost a small amount of money to send an email. It should cost a small amount to use a search engine or upload a video.<p>Advertising is a racket and it distorts incentives without actually producing much if anything in the way of economic good.<p>An effective search engine that has advertising as its revenue model is an oxymoron.",
