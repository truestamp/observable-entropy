      "text": "We have a fairly complex embedded system. I have been writing a Python script to analyze its register dump and narrow down the problem areas. But it is quite tedious writing such script, because I have to write a lot of code such as, the 1st bit of register 1 must equal to the 3rd bit of register 2; another example, register 3 plus register 4 must be no more than register 5 when register 6 is greater than 100.<p>I am thinking to write a DSL, Domain Specific Language, to describe the system specification and that DSL will generate Python code which does the checking.<p>Before I do this, is there a ready tool&#x2F;framework&#x2F;technology&#x2F;language I can leverage?<p>Someone mentioned TLA+, my first glimpse tells me it is not for my need. Like to hear your suggestions.<p>Thanks.",
