      "text": "I wonder if reading a book or listening to audio book without comprehending it at the time of reading&#x2F;listening is still valuable?<p>Case 1. Imagine you are reading (your eyes going through text) and brain got distracted while trying to comprehend and compare what you are reading with your experience from the past. You realize it after 1 page is done. Do you think your brain still can store chunks of data?<p>Case 2. You are reading super insightful book, which has 10 primary insights per page, but you only understand 1 insight.\nDo you think your brain still saved other insights and eventually will reveal it to you?<p>Case 3. You are listening audiobook and your brain didn&#x27;t keep up with the content (language understanding or trying to comprehend past sentences made you think about it too much, and anything else) Because going back and forth can slow down the listening, do you think continuing listening is still valuable and gives enough insights?<p>Why am I asking? I have mild ADHD and reading books is difficult to me, add into this language understanding (English is not my native language) and I am spending 10-15 minutes per page, trying to understand everything.<p>At the same time, OReilly subscription makes me really sad, by telling book with ~200 pages takes 5h to finish.",
