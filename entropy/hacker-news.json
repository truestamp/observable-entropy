It’s been 4 years and I’m still going through hell. I tried telling myself I didn’t love her but I still do. We have no contact except regarding the kids. It’s eating me alive.<p>I’m in talk therapy and have tried many other therapies so far without any success. I’m not in an emotional space where I can even “replace” her and even if I was that doesn’t seem healthy.<p>There’s this piece of me that’s holding on to what could have been and I don’t know how to let go. Does anyone have experience in dealing with this?<p>I know this isn’t typical HN. But I’ve posted an emotional support questions here in the past with great success.",
