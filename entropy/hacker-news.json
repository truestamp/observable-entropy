      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using 3 air purifiers for about a year now. The problem I have with them is that they are so high-maintenance (much more than I expected). If I don&#x27;t replace a filter after two months or less, I will get allergies (stuffy nose) because of the particles getting re-released back into the air. Has anyone had similar experience and&#x2F;or decisions? I&#x27;ve been following the advice of just adding more ventilation and cleaning the house more often. I honestly find that less annoying.",
