      "text": "I am sure this will sound nutty but please follow me on this weird path my brain has taken...<p>At first glance I thought NFT&#x27;s were just a strange spin on the art world and a cash grab or possibly even some stretch of the concept of a ponzi scheme.  And maybe those things are also true.  But then I took a few steps back and a few more steps back.<p>For many years I have said that the central banks would never allow cryptocurrencies to become popular and if they did, they would destroy them or find a way to control them.<p>Fast forward to today.  Cryptocurrencies are becoming popular and suddenly NFT&#x27;s appear.  People are jamming blockchains full of copyright theft and profiteering from it.  The items can&#x27;t be removed from the block chain so the only logical move would be to shut down any exchanges that are using the same blockchains used by NFT&#x27;s.  Simultaneous to this I see some big banks contemplating creating their own cryptocurrencies &#x2F; blockchains.<p>Am I stretching the lines to connect the dots?  Should I switch to decaf?",
