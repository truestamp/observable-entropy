      "text": "I&#x27;m not a technical co-founder (but can program some) but in a previous experience I partnered with one and we made a landing page and marketing site with Nuxt + Tailwind. I did the bulk of the site and it was pretty painless because my co-founder could also go in and tweak it.<p>Now I am creating something else with a non-technical co-founder. I am very comfortable with just html+css and maybe Tailwind or SSS to structure it. I am considering Webflow or a similar tool because of my non-technical co-founder since he will have a lot of input on the site as well. Should I stick with what I know or use one of these no-code platforms? For some reason I never looked at them because of a terrible Dreamweaver experience ages ago.",
