      "text": "Picture a fabric structure floating, anchored, in the ocean, roughly tube-shaped. At the surface, the edge is supported a few feet above average water level, positioned so waves wash over the edge into it. Once in, the only way out is down to the bottom end of the tube, say a thousand meters deep.<p>In the tube, where it narrows, is a flow meter and a pH meter. Water at the surface has atmospheric CO2 dissolved in it, which in water becomes carbonic acid, so the metrics report the exact quantity of atmospheric CO2 being driven to the deeps. Certified, transmitted by satellite, I think this should be able to be sold as carbon credits.<p>High waves are a shallow-water phenomenon, so the tube would need to be slanted to exhaust out in deep water, probably situated near an underwater cliff. The amount of wave water that can be collected depends on the perimeter, so the overall shape needs to be like a funnel, very wide at the top, but narrower below so the total amount of fabric needed is not extreme.<p>(Some may question whether this would acidify the deep ocean. A bit of calculation shows not, provided we cut carbon emissions in coming decades.)<p>I imagine thousands, maybe ultimately millions of these installed worldwide to draw down atmospheric CO2 using the whole ocean surface to collect it.<p>Is there anything I am misunderstanding about how carbon credits are awarded? How does one get metrics certified?",
