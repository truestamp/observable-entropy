      "text": "I want to code up a simple web app that allows the user to create a list of items that would be published each Sunday morning. There would be a web interface where the user could, when they feel inspired, enter a new item into the current list (or delete an item). Then on Sunday morning the list would be rendered as a web page and also emailed to a distribution list.<p>Currently I do this all &quot;by hand&quot;. I post my items to a slack channel as they occur to me throughout the week. Then at the end of the week I copy&#x2F;paste them into a markdown document (reformatting each item by hand) which is then processed via Jekyll into a web page and posted to the web (a github.io site). Then I copy&#x2F;paste the page into mailchimp to be sent to the email distribution list.<p>I am a fan of simple. I like programming in the context of not having to load (and grok) multiple giant frameworks. This would be maintained by me not by a giant team of software developers.<p>I am thinking of it as a web app simply so that it is machine-independent (I can do things from a laptop, desktop, iPad, etc) and so other people in principle could also post items to be included in the list.<p>Can I have some suggestions for what your stack might look like if you were in my shoes?<p>thanks!",
