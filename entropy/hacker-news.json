      "text": "Hi!\nI don&#x27;t know if this is weird, stupid or hard to answer, but I&#x27;d love your opinions.<p>If I&#x27;m trying to be objective, right now I&#x27;m just a mediocre(maybe average depending on who you compare me to) web developer with some CS basics(I have some surface knowledge about a lot of stuff, but this is the only field where I&#x27;m employable), I regressed&#x2F;stagnated a lot, and I don&#x27;t think I can find the motivation to become great at anything if it&#x27;s not to work on something truly life changing and really useful to the world.<p>I&#x27;m mostly interested by stuff that I could learn for free(including piracy).<p>When I say remote, I mean worldwide, preferably with the ability to be nomad.(IDC if I need to have meetings at insane hours from time to time)<p>When I say impactful I mean one of those things(by order of importance):<p>-working on climate change&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;greentech, with a chance to actually make a difference about the global catastrophes that are about to happen, not just making people feel good about themselves<p>-life-changing healthtech: preventive healthcare, life extension, significant mental health innovations, significant quality of life improvements...<p>-maybe education, but something that could really cause a paradigm shift, there is a good chance I&#x27;m mistaken but I don&#x27;t really think there is still much place for great innovation in that area given what&#x27;s available for free on the internet<p>-maybe lifting people out of extreme poverty, at scale(like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sama.com)<p>And I know that technically I could do web dev for companies working on this kind of stuff, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d really feel useful building the CRUD apps necessary to access the actually interesting&#x2F;innovative&#x2F;useful stuff.<p>So do you have any ideas&#x2F;advice?<p>I&#x27;m thinking about Data Science&#x2F;AI, but it seems really hard to become great&#x2F;legitimate in this field, especially if I have to earn money at the same time I&#x27;m learning, and isn&#x27;t there too many juniors already?Also wouldn&#x27;t the kind of work I&#x27;m looking for be limited to PhD&#x27;s, or really smart Master&#x27;s?<p>I&#x27;m willing to learn about other things than tech. I&#x27;d still like to work with tech, but using concepts from other fields could be interesting.<p>Thanks!",
