Type in some words from the page you imagine exists, and watch it come up.<p>That does not seem to work any more. Search engines of today act like I&#x27;m talking to them, asking them questions and such. I vaguely remember a similar MS Clippy thing, very helpful, yes. Not.<p>I don&#x27;t want to talk to a computer.  Why would I want that? That tech is crap still.<p>Neither DDG nor Gøogle return the full results for a given query. But they present it so as if they actually have it.<p>How can I ask a search engine to search over it&#x27;s own search result set? Or alternatively, how do I get past the Self-inserted Smartypants Interpreter to give it some literal chunks of text I want to be found on the page?<p>Someone working for the SE companies reading this, do you know anything about that?",
