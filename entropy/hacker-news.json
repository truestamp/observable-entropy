      "text": "I work for a small team and wear a lot of hats. My primary skill&#x2F;contribution is in many areas. My hypothesis is that as team size grows, individual hat count goes down, as the different players move into regular &quot;positions&quot;. I also wonder if its somewhat of a personality&#x2F;team configuration thing though. I&#x27;d like to sample that.<p>So how many hats are you wearing? How big is your team? Are you representative of everyone else on the team, or an anomaly?<p>(to me, the following are examples of &quot;hats&quot;: database admin, python backend, javascript front end, graphics designer (or liason), embedded C developer, etc. Done with enough frequency that it&#x27;s a regular part of your contribution, not just a &quot;dabble in&quot;)",
