      "text": "Hello HN,<p>My company has plans to build and run an enterprise SAAS product and I&#x27;d like to get some insight into the typical size and structure of the team required to implement such a project.<p>I know I&#x27;m skipping over a lot of the detail here, but what I can say is that it will be providing a mission critical service to the users, so uptime, reliability and security will be paramount.<p>The product will feature a REST API, web user interface and some additional command line tools. Users will be a mixture of service accounts (for automation) &amp; actual users doing stuff in the app.<p>I know my question is fairly vague, but I&#x27;d really appreciate feedback regarding what kind of team would be required, such as Project managers, product owners, devs, testers, devops engineers etc.. Along with any references&#x2F;resources linking to information on this kind of subject.<p>Thanks!",
