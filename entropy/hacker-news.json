      "text": "Adsense offers an automatic consent modal. But the problem with that one is that it not only displays the consent modal but also injects a smaller widget into the site. It looks like the widget only pops up when the user scrolls down to the bottom of the page. Unfortunately, that also makes it pop up when the page is not longer than the screen. So pages where the content fits on the screen look really shitty.<p>How do you guys deal with this?<p>Anybody here who wrote their own consent modal?",
