      "text": "I&#x27;d like to push back against it both from a) a technical standpoint (we have 5x as much marketing JS as actual app JS) and b) a principle standpoint (I believe it&#x27;s wrong to track people this pervasively). For example: we have a client-side script for every single one of the dozens of social networks that we buy ads on, for the purpose of tracking conversions.<p>I&#x27;m a senior front-end dev so I have some amount of sway in this matter, but I&#x27;m not sure how to make a business case for cutting down on this stuff. The impact on SEO is something, and we&#x27;re going to look for ways to trim the fat, but I think the conversion data is more valuable to the higher-ups than a few points on our Lighthouse score.<p>Has anybody had this conversation before? Any suggested angles I can take?",
