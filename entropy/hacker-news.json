      "text": "I&#x27;m a paid user of MEGA (mega.nz) and I&#x27;ve had a very bad surprise recently when trying to download my data. The MEGASync desktop app consistently oscillates around 10-15MB&#x2F;s.<p>I contacted MEGA&#x27;s support and I had a very long and painful email thread where they provided me with unhelpful solutions such as:<p>– Set the “Download rate limit” to “No limit”<p>– For added security, improved loading times and handling of large files, you should install our browser extension<p>– Try to perform the transfer during a non-peak time, you should notice an increase of the transfer speed rate<p>They asked me several times to run speed tests, which consistently showed that my connection reached 1 Gbps. They also asked me dozens and dozens of unhelpful things to check.<p>After countless back-and-forths, they eventually escalated the issue to their engineers. They then told me that their ‶team has tried to fix the issue on [their] end″. No speed difference of course.<p>They then just gave up and said that a 10MB&#x2F;s download speed for a premium $100&#x2F;yr premium account is ‶acceptable″ and ‶within standard parameters″ (whatever that means). Their direct competitor 1fichier provides a 10× faster download speed that maximizes my connection at 100+ MB&#x2F;s for only around 1&#x2F;5 of the price. Big oops.<p>Stay away from this terrible provider. On their website they claim ‶super fast transfer speeds″ and ‶pay less for better performance″. This is just a plain lie. What other claims are bullshit? Their claim that they are ‶reliable″ and have ‶redundant server infrastructure″?",
