So far I have managed to get to know if a monitor is connected to the HDMI, but in no way I can now if it has been switched off or has lost power. Also I have no way to know if someone has just pressed the off button. It is just that xset and xrandr (the option talked in numerous SO posts) doesn&#x27;t get that information.<p>Is there any way?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve moved around quite a bit these past several years and I feel like every company has been the same. Management don&#x27;t know what they want the product to be. Project managers don&#x27;t know anything about technology. There&#x27;s an offshore team in Traansylvania busy making it a legacy codebase. They don&#x27;t want to give developers raises...<p>I see &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring?&quot; threads and &quot;Who Wants To Be Hired?&quot; threads. How about a &quot;Who Doesn&#x27;t Suck To Work For?&quot; thread?<p>Not sure if this will take off or get deleted ...but if it does take off, it would be great if developers --not recruiters-- replied to this. Tell us why your company is a good place to work so we can apply there :-)",
