How do users feel about this rule and does it improve the quality of content and conversations here?<p>Would it help if users also followed similar practice on other social media platforms (e.g. I see many YouTube videos asking for like, subscribe, comments, and bell icon)<p>--------------- Below taken from Hackernews FAQ -------------\nCan I ask people to upvote my submission?<p>No. Users should vote for a story because they personally find it intellectually interesting, not because someone has content to promote. We penalize or ban submissions, accounts, and sites that break this rule, so please don&#x27;t.",
