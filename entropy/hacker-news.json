This user seems to be testing twitter features and gaming the system intentionally since they have other tweets with irrelevant warnings attached ([1], [2]). Why are they able to do this?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;29notions&#x2F;status&#x2F;1313220807259312132\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;29notions&#x2F;status&#x2F;1311404976527343618",
