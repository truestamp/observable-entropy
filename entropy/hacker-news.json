      "text": "I think this might actually be a few questions:\n1. Has anybody noticed their own cognitive decline? I&#x27;m 30 but am interested in experiences at all ages\n2. Does anybody have a good way of testing their intellect or problem-solving periodically? This would at least help me keep track going forward \n3. Has anybody found ways to improve their problem-solving skills? Or critical thinking?<p>I feel like my ability to solve problems well - efficiently, cleverly, satisfactorily, completely - has reduced over time (past year, maybe multiple years? I&#x27;m not really sure.) For example, I&#x27;ll find that a programming solution didn&#x27;t account for things I should&#x27;ve considered or introduced a new bug; or a co-worker will suggest a different solution and it seems obviously better. I don&#x27;t think this has always been the case; I used to be pretty school smart in subjects like math and comp sci. My theories:\n - Maybe my intellect has diminished from using alcohol and weed at an early age?\n - Maybe that I&#x27;ve been feeling a bit burnt out\n - Maybe I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and rely too much on, e.g., stackoverflow \n - Maybe medicine I take for mental health?\n - Insufficient sleep? I&#x27;ve been getting 6-7 recently but should probably be getting 7-9\n - Maybe I&#x27;ve actually always been dumb and am only now realizing it!<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated. If it&#x27;s something I can change, that would be a huge relief.",
