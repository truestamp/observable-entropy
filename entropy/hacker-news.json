      "text": "I&#x27;m losing my mind over a luxury problem: Currently a PhD student in the south of Germany. A few month ago, I went through a difficult phase in life and suddenly considered not going for an industry career and missing out on the money to be a huge mistake. So I started to shop around for offers and recently got hit up with a very generous Junior SWE offer: 115k TC (currently 55k).<p>However, in the meantime I was also able to find my motivation again for continuing the PhD. My main project is dealing with the application of computer vision and deep learning. While not overly excited about the specific topic, I appreciate the freedom, the intellectually challenging work, even teaching. Most of all, I enjoy to really become an expert in a domain.<p>I&#x27;m completely lost on how to proceed now: My stomach feeling is to decline the offer. It is in an unrelated field, so I&#x27;d have to give up on deep learning which sucks a lot. However, it is also a fantastic salary for Germany. I&#x27;m waking up at night sweating bullets about giving up so much money, missing out on the kick-start of an industry career. But I&#x27;m also sweating bullets about not working in machine learning anymore. I&#x27;ve already put so much energy into machine learning and fear that, once I switch away, the path back to it won&#x27;t be easy.<p>&quot;Money is just a hygiene factor&quot; seems like a good perspective once you already made bank. Have you given up on a good salary early in your career? What is your experience? What would you recommend?",
