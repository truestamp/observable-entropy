      "text": "I have a PhD in aerospace engineering and a fairly well-established career in the space industry (mostly R&amp;D). Recently, I&#x27;ve been thinking about how to contribute more to climate science, since I see climate change as a major, urgent problem. I believe I have skills that are transferrable to other relevant fields, and I&#x27;m wondering how I might make the most direct impact.<p>As part of my job, I do a lot of modeling &amp; simulation, which involves technical computing, including some work with high-performance computing. Most of my background is in dynamics and estimation&#x2F;control, so I have a lot of experience with linear algebra, differential equations, and statistics.<p>I&#x27;ve considered ways to remain in the space industry (e.g. by working climate-related satellite missions), but I&#x27;m also not opposed to opening the aperture even wider - e.g. joining an organization that can use my programming skills for more direct climate science purposes.<p>I&#x27;m hoping the HN hivemind can help me generate more ideas here, or even just provide more varied perspectives.",
