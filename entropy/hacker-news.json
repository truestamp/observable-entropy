The HN frontpage updates more slowly than Reddit, so I waste less time getting sucked into the link abyss.<p>2. I don&#x27;t feel compelled to engage in the Reddit karma game. I&#x27;ve found myself mid-comment deciding that this is a waste of time, and just close the page.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what exactly is my point. But I&#x27;m starting to appreciate the value of small neich communities like HN.",
