In one instance they used a real email address, so I have their name and know the company they work for (which is in my industry and we actually have mutual colleagues). What could this person possibly be doing with all these weird form submissions? I have a very basic, static website, do no A&#x2F;B testing, and haven&#x27;t made any updates to it in months. What do you think?",
