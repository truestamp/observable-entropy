      "text": "Hey HN gang, freelance mobile dev here -<p>A potential client is asking for a &quot;company-branded forum &amp; chatroom&quot;-as-an-app, where different sections of the forum&#x2F;chatrooms have membership-access paywall, all with a super simple UI.  Customers should be able to download the app in the Apple App store, and then pay&#x2F;sign up for various sections of the community (e.g. they might need to be certified before joining).<p>After some searching the web, I&#x27;m feeling a bit stumped.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to find a (paid or open source) out-of-the-box, good UI, ready-to-go, &quot;upload your logo &#x2F; &amp; customize colors &amp; publish&quot; type service (think: Shopify).<p>To anyone with expertise in this area, can you suggest any solutions to look into? I&#x27;d love to get my potential client a response back ASAP with a couple reasonable options &#x2F; level-of-effort estimates.   Thank you for any info you can provide!<p>-J<p>* Full transparency, this is year #1 for me of iOS mobile app development, so with my current skill level, I&#x27;m hoping to cobble together existing solutions rather than build from scratch. Yak-shaving and all that :)",
