      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m incredibly fortunate to be a US software dev working remotely from a very low CoL country. The company I work for is great too. Super understanding about stress and life commitments, and well managed projects without excessive meetings. Furthermore, we make a product that I actually believe is good.<p>My problem is that I will be moving back to the US in 1-2 year with my family and we want to live in a high CoL part of the US (where her family lives).<p>She is not a US citizen, so we will be single income for a while.<p>My raise last year was less than 10% with a promotion and it was the biggest on my team.<p>Is there a way I can communicate to my company that I would need at least a 50% raise over the next two years in order to provide for my family?<p>I know people here like to say &quot;Just live somewhere cheaper&quot;, but I&#x27;m sure you could understand that we would very much like to live near her American family.",
