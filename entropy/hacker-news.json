      "text": "So like many of you I feel pretty confident in being able to find a fully remote job, as I&#x27;ve already been remote for the last 2 years on various contracts.<p>The backstory here is City A is my current home and I absolutely love it, City b is a place I lived for about a year and I love that as well. I came up with the  genius idea that I would buy a condo in City B, and live there about 6 or 7 months out of the year, while I&#x27;d rent in City A for the other 6 months.<p>Aside from being a waste of money and sounding strange, has anyone else done this ?<p>I can find a condo in City B for about 200k. I will not own a car in ether cities as both have fantastic public transportation.",
