But that&#x27;d feel unfairly divisive, given that my opinion is that both consoles have terrible user experiences.<p>If you wrote a list of all the software that you use on a daily basis (Google Docs, Mac Mail, IOS, Twitter, TikTok...), they&#x27;d probably all be better than either consoleâ€”and considerably so.<p>Both the Playstation and Xbox lack empathetic design or any real onboarding, and they make hundreds of obvious UX mistakes.\nFor example:<p>- Not auto-focusing on fields when there&#x27;s only one field &#x2F; action on the screen.<p>- Not auto-proceeding between the month and day fields in a date-picker.<p>- Empty states without actions (e.g., &quot;no WiFi connected&quot; without a link to connect the WiFi).<p>- Poorly-labelled settings (e.g., the difference between Playstation&#x27;s &#x27;Avatars&#x27; and &#x27;Profile pictures&#x27;).<p>- Basic functionality requires customer service (e.g., cancelling a pre-order on Playstation).&quot;",
