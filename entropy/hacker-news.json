      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>WebReducer is a project I&#x27;ve been working on since last December. You can read about my process here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbyone.us&#x2F;tags&#x2F;micro-business&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbyone.us&#x2F;tags&#x2F;micro-business&#x2F;</a><p>Send some data to WebReducer. Then, write a reducer function to retain some state. You can change the reducer function as much as you want and recreate that state.<p>Still working on how to explain it. It&#x27;s a tiny FaaS platform. It&#x27;s a tiny database. It&#x27;s &quot;redux&quot; on the server as a service. It&#x27;s a backend for tiny personal projects. It&#x27;s a place to send your webhooks.<p>I&#x27;m looking for feedback on the following:<p>- Do you get what it is?\n- What would you use it for?\n- What would I need to iron out for you to seriously consider trying this?",
