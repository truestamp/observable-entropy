      "text": "We are an indie animation&#x2F;game&#x2F;music studio. We were going through the submission process on Steam with &quot;M doll&quot;(1467760), an interactive animated feature film wherein you can watch the film and &quot;jump&quot; into the scenes and explore them.<p>During the submission process a Steam support employee &quot;Mary&quot; retired our game and closed the thread with a vague explanation about crypto and Nft&#x27;s<p>Their message is here\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;zYS29p3.png<p>Afterwards we found 4 different games that integrate Nft&#x27;s that are already on Steam and brought that up to Steam support and received no answers.<p>In our interactive film the &quot;crypto integration&quot; was just the ability to see the contract address for the one NFT we made for the film and show the wallet address of the current owner. There was also a QR for the Rarible page for the same NFT.<p>We would have removed the QR&#x27;s if they gave us a chance to but they just retired it and closed the thread. We have since sent about 15 messages to Steam support with no answers received.<p>We&#x27;ve been through the Steam submission process before and when they have issues they let you know, you deal with them and re-submit for approval. I can&#x27;t find any other instances of a support person at Steam &quot;retiring&quot; a developers game without their permission.<p>I guess they didn&#x27;t like the film?! Or they feel films should not be interactive?!<p>We&#x27;ll probably release the executable for free on Internet Archive now.<p>You can see how the interactive stuff works here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L16WtgpnDDc<p>The film was made in Unity, its actually the first animated feature film made entirely in Unity- so we rendered out the film as an mp4 which we play in the interactive exe- we created 37 interactive scenes using the cutscenes from the film itself that are mapped to times in the film- so when you press a key while watching the film it takes you to a realtime version of that scene in which you can explore, listen to commentary, play the cutscene, play music etc.<p>When you press that key again it takes you back to the film where you left off.<p>Unity doesn&#x27;t support 2 hour audio files so we had to write our own dvd type player with multiple soundtrack support etc- we also wrote our own crowd sim for the film production itself etc-<p>There are also 4 different soundtracks, several visual &quot;looks&quot; you can change etc-<p>We did a making of wiki on github too https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mdotstrange&#x2F;MDoll&#x2F;wiki<p>Trailer for the film\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xHz_pQWRAu8<p>Anyhow, don&#x27;t innovate too hard on Steam or they gone ban you!<p>Our substack https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imaginationrabbit.substack.com&#x2F;",
