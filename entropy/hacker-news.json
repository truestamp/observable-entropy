I&#x27;m looking for something in the sci-fi&#x2F;fantasy realm that depicts characters with a variety of motivations, biases, and cultural backgrounds. I want to be able to discuss how the fictional world influences how the characters think, feel, and grow.<p>A junior high reading comprehension level would probably be best, although I&#x27;m willing to consider things more juvenile or advanced. It can be a paper and ink graphic novel or a digital format like a web comic; either is fine.",
