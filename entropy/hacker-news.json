      "text": "A few years ago we were running lots of distributed compute jobs and I picked up some high spec mac pro 5.1 that people were selling off in the bay area. I could pick up a 12 core 3+ Ghz with 32 GB of ram unit for about $500. They served their purpose but we started doing other work and they gathered dust. I then had to run some analysis requiring deep GPU enabled compute, with minimal work I was able to convert a 5.1 running macOS to running Ubuntu 20.04 with an NVIDIA card. No doubt Apple fans will find this abhorrent but Apple has discontinued support for the 5.1 yet they are still as powerful as many modern computers. If you want to know how we did it then get in touch.",
