Can someone explain how fake news comes under debate dissent and protest?<p>Let me give examples:<p>1) &quot;Lockdowns are not worth the costs&quot; is an alternative opinion<p>2) &quot;India charges WHO Scientist Soumya Swaminathan for Mass Murder&quot; is fake news<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hannenabintuherland.com&#x2F;asia&#x2F;india-charges-who-scientist-soumya-swaminathan-for-mass-murder-the-beginning-of-accountability&#x2F;<p>The Indian bar association, a private entity filed a complaint about the WHO scientist, but that story has been changed by a lot of politically partisan outlets to mean the govt has charged&#x2F;prosecuted the WHO scientist for it.<p>The fake story has been extremely popular on social media.<p>It&#x27;s not an alternative opinion, a debate or discussion. It&#x27;s just plain wrong but went very viral. Why are there objections to not have these kinds of stories spread on social media?<p>No one defends(with claims of free speech) about phishers scamming older people with lies about being a Nigerian prince etc. but why is there so much push back against actions on fake news?<p>Is it possible to cut down the worst examples of #2 without affecting actual alternative opinions like #1 ?",
