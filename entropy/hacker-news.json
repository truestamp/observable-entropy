      "text": "I learned today that when you Copy All inside of a browser and then Paste into your text editor: It DOES NOT SHOW you the full contents of what is saved. I see stripped content. This greatly concerns me because I thought I could copy into a text editor, review for malicious javascript and various html etc, and if all clear, then paste the same contents into eg: another page (maybe the contents of a new comment box, or run a script on my server, etc). But all of the tags etc disappear when pasting into my text editor, leaving me with a completely false sense of security.<p>So I ask you, oh wise ones: How do YOU verify the contents of copied HTML from a browser?<p>How to reproduce my problem:\n1) ctrl+a and ctrl+c this web site\n2) open gedit, notepad, or create a new file in PHPStorm or even dev console\n3) ctrl+v : you see plain text\n4) go to summernote.org and ctrl+v into the big test box (even try this in a different browser!)\n5) you see html the result of html,css, etc",
