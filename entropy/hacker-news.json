      "text": "Some time ago, I started a subscription-based website that has slowly gained momentum and revenue. Currently, my monthly recurring revenue from this site is about $45k USD per month. I’m taking ~$14k&#x2F;mo salary (which is far more than enough for my needs) and I’m paying one other dev part time about ~$6k&#x2F;mo. My other expenses to keep it up and running are only ~$2k&#x2F;mo. That leaves quite a bit leftover and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with it. I have no desire to expand the operation for many reasons. I’m perfectly happy working on it full time myself and don’t want to change anything. My question is what am I supposed to do with that profit? Claim it all myself as income? Let it accumulate in the business account? The company is formed as an LLC and I am based in the US, for reference.",
