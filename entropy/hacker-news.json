      "text": "I was watching a youtube channel when I heard someone saying bragging they have found a solution to process Visa &#x2F; MC payments in Russia after about a month of stalemate.\nThat got me curious, how do they do it? Turns out they managed to escape the vetting process via processors like hxxps:&#x2F;&#x2F;donate.bot&#x2F; via Telegram.<p>I assume Donate are breaking the rules by doing so, but any idea how to bring this to the attention of Visa &#x2F; MC? It&#x27;s not about a particular individual or company, this is a blatant loophole they are exploiting with licensees from Asia.<p>Not sure it would be possible but I don&#x27;t want to end up finding later that they managed to wash billions of dollars like this, basically rendering the sanctions useless. Therefore I hope this posts draws attention to someone from Visa &#x2F; MC.<p>I have added some SS for reference (blurred the channel details just in case someone from Donate.bot sees this before MC &#x2F; Visa does) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;LBCzEku",
