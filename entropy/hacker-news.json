      "text": "As Andrew Ng recently pointed out, &quot;Every hospital has its own slightly different format for electronic health records&quot; and &quot;you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;andrew-ng-data-centric-ai). In other words, every firm has a different data model.<p>As data volume and uses continue to explode, what will happen to data <i>structures</i>? Will data model &#x2F; schema &#x2F; structure variance get wider or narrower?<p>Argument for narrowing: standardization becomes too powerful to resist. Example: Ford standardizing auto parts<p>Argument for widening: everyone competes for an &quot;edge&quot; in extracting value from data. Generating the &quot;edge&quot; means proprietary models. Proprietary models require not only bespoke &quot;black box&quot;es, but also proprietary ways of normalizing&#x2F;standardizing data and related schemas. Furthermore, even if the model was not shared, each industry participant is not going to wait for some common &quot;standard&quot; to reflect the latest evolution of how it thinks about its data model.<p>Which trend will win?",
