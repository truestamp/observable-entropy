      "text": "As a small, useless but fun hobby project, I wanted to try and draw something inside my EU Covid Pass QR certificate WITHOUT relying on error correction or rendering the digital certificate invalid.<p>TL;DR - some deflate misuse, mixed-mode alphanumeric and numeric QR encoding, mask choice override, padding the code with content that base45 encodes to numbers only and choosing them in a way to produce a meaningful image. Apparently, verifier apps are fine with it - every one I tried scans green.<p>This is a non-prod demo cert used for illustration of the concept with some funny images inside:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;3JonSRX.png<p>Would there be any interest in me doing a post explaining how it was done?<p>Also, what else should I draw inside?",
