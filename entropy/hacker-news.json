      "text": "I&#x27;ve used ThinkPads all the way from the IBM days and those good old solid Dell computers too.<p>Recently, I decided it was time for an update. I use Linux on the often so it was important for me to purchase a laptop that was compatible.<p>I bought 2 laptops, all of which I had to return in the last 2 months.<p>1. Dell XPS: I spent over 20+ hours with their support going back and forth. I also had a tech come to my house to replace my motherboard before I gave up and demanded a return<p>2. Lenovo Carbon X1: The laptop came with a faulty keyboard so I just returned it because I didn&#x27;t want to wait 30 days for a mail-in repair or drive 2 hours to go to a &quot;local&quot; repair shop. They also made me order the laptop 3 times because their system kept cancelling it for whatever reason so it took an insane amount of time to just purchase the laptop (I spent ~6 hours to just purchase the laptop)<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just unlucky but the time I spent and energy I spent to just purchase these laptops shows you why people buy from Apple instead. I strongly dislike MacOS because they force the &quot;apple way&quot; of doing things. But it seems to be the only option these days to buy a computer with ease and get a computer &quot;that just works&quot;. My Macbook was more expensive but the time I saved outweighs the price imo.",
