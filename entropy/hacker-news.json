I&#x27;m not much of an idea guy, but am a seasoned engineer.<p>I want to work on building either an API or a dataset. Any field, the only requirement is that is it be useful to someone or some people.<p>So if you have any ideas on what might be worthwhile or useful to work on.. or even just lots of fun, please let me know. I have way too much time on my hands. Thanks.",
