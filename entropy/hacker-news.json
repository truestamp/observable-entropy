      "text": "Hi Hackernews. I&#x27;ve built a variety of home&#x2F;gaming and small office PCs for friends and family over lockdown as I&#x27;m sure many of you have.<p>I have found myself constantly troubleshooting opaque UEFI&#x2F;BIOS settings, particularly regarding CPU&#x2F;RAM frequency and configuration, USB issues, lack of obvious functionality.<p>Why is it that consumer motherboards are so inconsistent and difficult to work with? MSI in particular has been a pain, but after working with several brands it seems to be widespread. When it comes to making consumer PCs with up to date components (ryzen 5XXX) are there any decent options or alternatives? Thanks.",
