      "text": "This thread on the front page, &quot;Anyone making a living building desktop applications?&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30027925) hit me pretty hard, especially since I&#x27;m currently looking for a new job and struggling to decide what I want to do with life. Of course there are just as many projects that never break a hundred bucks, but seeing all these figures of hundreds to thousands per month on straightforward, no-nonsense software sales makes me feel like I&#x27;m wasting my potential.<p>But the dissonance part is that I&#x27;m standing on mountains upon mountains of free software, to the point that it feels difficult to justify selling any of the measly stuff I write. I don&#x27;t think any other industry is like this. Linux is free. SQLite is free, it&#x27;s even public domain. My feelings about SQLite are strong enough that I wrote about it last year (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voussoir.net&#x2F;writing&#x2F;sqlite_what_a_hunk). I can&#x27;t remember the last time I paid for software and I don&#x27;t know how I could charge someone else for software without feeling like a big poser.<p>I already know the technical answer, which is that people will pay for something if it adds value to their life. So yeah, I get that. But the idea that my stupid code is worth money when I don&#x27;t even pay for the stuff that improves <i>my</i> life is difficult to reconcile. You can visit my profile to see what I make.<p>What are your thoughts?<p>Thanks",

      "text": "She&#x27;s elderly, and generally terrible with computers and tech.<p>When she is shown something, she generally needs to be reminded or re-taught it several times, and on an ongoing basis if she&#x27;s not using it every day.<p>And that&#x27;s if the tech is not total garbage, which most of it is, imo.<p>I used an iPhone as an example, because I&#x27;d like her to learn how to use her iPhone7, but it&#x27;s really all sorts of things -- like Gmail, and the TCL Android TV remote, and etc.<p>I was thinking maybe oversized, bite-sized flashcards that just include the very basics, and I would sketch up the idea and content and have someone give me a pretty picture, then create and sell them on Amazon to recoup my costs.<p>Like, the &#x27;Dummies&#x27; books are the right-ish idea, but we would not need 97% of the content in it.<p>She had an iPad but gave it up -- maybe she&#x27;d be open to getting it again (I would give it to her), but I&#x27;m not sure it actually solves any problems.<p>She can do without some tech, but she&#x27;s got to be able to get to her Rockford Files on IMDBtv, etc. - so presumably she needs to know how to use the controller. The audio features are, of course, trash, imo -- you&#x27;ll often get a list of apps and &#x27;squares&#x27; that she can&#x27;t navigate. If Amazon Prime comes up and you select&#x2F;OK a square (a show), and you have not paid for it yet, nothing will happen -- no UI feedback at all. That&#x27;s just one small example of garbage tech.<p>The digital oven has a map of which dial goes with wihich burner, but the labels&#x2F;pictograms under each burner are miniscule and require at least reading glasses for her, and even then they&#x27;re small, and the UI of the dials is still confusing, imo.<p>Ideas?",
