      "text": "I come from a country where most people build homes on their own. One norm that we always practice is that bathrooms are either equal in number, or more than the number of bedrooms in the house. This is because we are always an extended family, and extended family visits us. Most bedrooms have an attached bathroom + 1 (common bathroom for guests&#x2F;maids&#x2F;)<p>In America, I found that it is exact opposite. Bathrooms are less in number compared to bedrooms. My son and daughter are fighting for bathroom time as we live in a 4 Bed 2 bath house. Adding to our agony was when my parents who recently visited us. Now, one bathroom for 4 people.<p>I understand the cost implications. But compared to my house in my motherland, American house is 3 times bigger. Why can&#x27;t the builders reduce size and build more bathrooms.",

      "text": "Full disclosure: I&#x27;m not a computer scientist, I&#x27;m just a programmer who uses these tools. Also I mainly use javascript and go, I need to spread out more but these two tools fulfill 99% of all my needs.<p>I had a 2am idea and when I looked it up I couldn&#x27;t find any mention of someone else thinking of it. Here it is:<p>Function currying is a method for saving arguments on the callstack so they don&#x27;t have to be copied in memory between calls. Here&#x27;s a javascript example of currying:<p>```js\nconst add = (leftOp) =&gt; (rightOp) =&gt; leftOp + rightOp;\nconst addThree = add(3);\nconsole.log(addThree(4)); &#x2F;&#x2F; 7\nconsole.log(addThree(-2)); &#x2F;&#x2F; 1\n```<p>I think all PL that support the &quot;putting-functions-in-variables&quot; paradime can do this. BUT. If you try to call a normal function that requires all of its arguments up front without all the arguments it will throw an error. So what if it didn&#x27;t? What if instead of throwing an error, the function call returns a curried function with the first arguments filled and the unfilled arguments left to be inputted.<p>```js\n&#x2F;&#x2F; with autocurrying\nconst add = (leftOp, rightOp) =&gt; leftOp + rightOp;\nconst addFive = add(5); &#x2F;&#x2F; addFive is defined like addFive = (rightOp) =&gt; 5 + rightOp\nconsole.log(addFive(3)); &#x2F;&#x2F; 8\n```<p>This could work in Javascript(&#x2F;Typescript), Python, Go and similar languages. By encouraging currying you could potentaily get memory saving, readibility, and performance. But I won&#x27;t ever try to sell you a stack of pros without a foundation of cons: any syntax sugar has the potential to cause logic bugs, reference bugs, and missuse.<p>What do you guys think?",
