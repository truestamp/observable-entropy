I am not color blind and I find myself wondering what handing him a pair of “corrective” sunglasses could do for him.<p>The glasses on the market seem hit or miss, but the harm of them <i>not working</i> seems minimal if I stay casual about the experience, “hey, try these and tell me if anything looks different.” If yes, great, if not, no big deal and the day continues as any normal day. I won’t explain anything unless he can see new colors.<p>This is my question: For those that are color blind, could you see this experience harming a child’s view of the world or themselves in a negative way? Pun not intended… even though he’s a redhead.",
