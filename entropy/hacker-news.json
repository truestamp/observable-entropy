      "text": "I have some non-technical relatives in Russia, and they have started to feel the need to use a VPN for their average internet activities. Is there any recommended company to get a subscription from? I assume the sanctions will be a limiting factor in terms of variety and quality. Or is it better that I, as an outsider, pay the subscription and they just start using it from Russia? I hope we can keep the conversation non-political because I just want to help my relatives remain as free and informed as possible, despite the situation.<p>So, which VPN provider should one use from Russia?",

      "text": "Its common in our industry to get to tech interviews and expect to do white boarding exercises about binary tree and matrix operations. And while these can prove your academic proficiency, these are rarely the day to day skills that make a developer competent. I was told by a hiring manager once that their reasoning behind this is that &quot;if you know the CS fundamentals it would be easier to collaborate across teams&quot;. To me this doesn&#x27;t really translate into real life. I just wanted to rant about my dissatisfaction with white boarding interviews, but I also wanted to know what is the general sentiment at HN",
