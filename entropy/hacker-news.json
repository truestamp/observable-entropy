      "text": "Yesterday I was reading the article about NixOS on the framework laptop, and the guy said that he had mostly a stationary machine, that was heavy etc.<p>So I don&#x27;t have a working laptop, I had a couple in the past that were overheating, hard to un-dust, hardly fixable, and it was sitting always in the same spot, maybe except for when I had to go to holiday for a couple of weeks a year and wanted something to kill time.<p>Since then I have only bought desktops, and keep a low-power tablet&#x2F;laptop for emergency, so what I wanted to ask people that still use laptops as primary machines, what&#x27;s the reason why you guys buy those overexpensive, unfixable, limited machines even if like never going to work anywhere?<p>Of course everyone does whatever he wants, it is just a matter of curiousity for me, to understand if it&#x27;s like the result of marketing or there&#x27;s some reason I fail to see behind the popularity of laptops",
