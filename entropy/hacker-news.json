      "text": "When the Apple Watch first came out, I swore I&#x27;d buy one as soon as the technology matured after a few iterations-I had always loved the idea of wearables, and the Apple Watch really seemed to hit a sweet spot.<p>Fast forward several years, and I&#x27;m very disgruntled with the idea of smart&#x2F;wearable&#x2F;IOT&#x2F;etc devices-the fact that they&#x27;re expensive and require replacing regularly like a phone, require regular charging, the fact that I&#x27;d sometimes like to be alone without any outside connectivity, etc just really turns me off. Also having had a few instances of natural disasters to deal with over the past few years makes me yearn for something just a lot less dependent on regular charging than a smart watch.<p>So, Ive gone back to (for the time being) ordering a good old Timex Ironman as a cheap standby that will last quite a while and do what it needs to do. I&#x27;ll look into upgrading to something a bit fancier and possibly mechanical if the Timex experiment works out. I&#x27;m just wondering if I&#x27;m alone in this, or maybe I&#x27;m tapping into a (very slight) anti smart device sentiment that&#x27;s only prevalent in really tech centric communities.",
