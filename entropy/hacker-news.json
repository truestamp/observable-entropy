      "text": "Hi HN, I graduated last year in 2020 and has been working in the banking industry for a year. The pay is okay, but still in the bottom 40% income bracket in my country. The job itself is fairly technical, involving data management and data analysis. I find myself feeling lethargic and not having any energy after work. Although the job has a decent work life balance as my boss does not contact me after work hours, the stress and anxiety of the job remain. How do I sustain myself working in this job and avoid burning out? How do I maximize my learning and deliver good results while working here? Thank you.",
