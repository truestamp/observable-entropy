      "text": "Today GitHub CoPilot revealed &amp; implemented its pricing.<p>There are other threads on that news (the headline is $10&#x2F;mo).<p>But I think this is <i>also</i> interesting as a case-study in Product Management.<p>Sure - Microsoft paid $1 billion IIRC to OpenAI, and this was an obvious product concept (albeit incredibly hard to implement, extremely well exected, etc.)<p>But it was really NOT obvious this would land as *GitHub* CoPilot.<p>Consider the alternatives:<p>- &quot;Microsoft CoPilot&quot;\nStill the biggest brand, but this was never likely.<p>- &quot;Azure CoPilot&quot;\nThis is what we would all have expected - and the fact they didn&#x27;t do this is very interesting indeed. More on this later!<p>- &quot;Visual Studio CoPilot&quot;\nA few years ago this would have certainly been where this landed. But this wouldn&#x27;t have worked well today:\n a) Visual Studio is eclipsed by its own younger brother\n b) This would have implied a coupling which doesn&#x27;t exist (CoPilot is also for JetBrains, etc.) Unless they decided to make this VS &amp; VSCode only - which they surely would have considered.\n c) Visual Studio&#x27;s online services are heavily associated with only the .NET and C ecosystems<p>Then there&#x27;s GitHub. Certainly a huge brand. But that&#x27;s table-stakes for this list.<p>Yes - GitHub is all about developers. But the brand (pre GitHub CoPilot) was really specific in scope. It&#x27;s about Git, and community. The technology association was pretty old (everyone knows git is pretty old &amp; with a famous inventor everyone knows it wasn&#x27;t their innovation).<p>Yes - GitHub is doing other things that are really impressive. But really only CodeSpaces can be described as direct developer tooling. And CodeSpaces is new, obscure, and has a clear fit with the repo-hosting (make the repo editable).<p>Azure on the other hand:\n - Could really have used the publicity&#x2F;millions of new Azure accounts. This alone could have been realistically worth $billions. Because it&#x27;s a significant association with a large number of developers &amp; decision-makers in such a lucrative market<p>- Could have made MORE by bundling: $10&#x2F;mo or free for Azure users.<p>- Has a go-to-market that&#x27;s better at monetizing. There&#x27;s salespeople &amp; consumption-credits &amp; vendor-approvals, etc.<p>- Azure is MUCH more associated with AI, offering a whole host of AI services (and being where most of the other OpenAI stuff landed).<p>- Azure is more associated with dev-tooling than GitHub. (Although Visual Studio is far more associated than both put together, many times over).<p>Here&#x27;s why I think they chose GitHub: it&#x27;s strongly associated with open-source.<p>Sure, many people have asked whether AI trained on open-source&#x2F;public repos with mixed licenses has licensing issues with the generated code.<p>But coming from GitHub, the well-loved champions of OSS? People asking this question are in the minority.\nIf Azure did it - those whispers would have been shouts. Or a riot.<p>When you go with a cloud vendor, in a lot of ways it&#x27;s all or nothing. People have strong opinions.<p>Then you have GitHub. Which feels neutral. GitHub&#x27;s monetization is low &amp; very fair. (SideNote: if this <i>had</i> ended up being Azure CoPilot I think it would be $30&#x2F;mo or more).<p>GitHub is a good launching pad for services designed to be universal; adopted equally by AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;Heroku&#x2F;whatever users. It has goodwill but not baggage. It uses its influence so softly &amp; so helpfully.<p>It seems Microsoft has chosen to be everywhere with CoPilot, and ultimately own more of the developer-experience - rather than take the MayFair &amp; Park Lane hotel which &quot;Azure CoPilot&quot; would have been.<p>If anyone has internal insight, or a product-manager&#x27;s take, please take over from here!",
