      "text": "I have an ex who has a penchant for finding me. She claims she found me because of location sharing on my iPhone, but I double checked almost all the location settings and see everything looks disabled. Is there a full list of settings that I can run through to ensure she isn&#x27;t able to find me via some rogue app leaking my current location? I didn&#x27;t post any images with location meta data either. I don&#x27;t have sharing on in Google Maps or Apple Maps. She&#x27;s not listed in &quot;Find My&quot; or the other obvious IOS app settings. I&#x27;m truly baffled how she is able to find me. It&#x27;s also quite frustrating, because there are like 50% of the apps that need location data, like I can&#x27;t just turn if on and off every time I need to use Uber or my bank (which requires it for fraud detection I think). There are so many apps that have some good&#x2F;bad reason to justify not just blanket turning off location data in a lot of instances and it&#x27;s quite frustrating. Any general tips, lists of things to disable, etc would be greatly appreciated. Also, I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s possible she may have installed some app that&#x27;s quietly tracking me when we were together. I see many apps out there for sale that claim to do this. Wondering if people have info on those and how well they actually work and can stay hidden.",
