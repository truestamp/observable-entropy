Question: How do you manage to get around that if you must?<p>Let me get the obvious out of the way: Yes, I know much if not nearly all about md5 and others being broken and dangerous &amp; Everything SSL 1 to TLS 1.1 being banned&#x2F;disabled etc. etc.\nNow sometimes if you want to access some website from a local device or a legacy server, its ridiculous that you just can&#x27;t get around at all. Again, I know, its done so the average customers are safe. But the whole crypto enforcement has created something that did not exist before. Broken&#x2F;Refused access to web services still working.<p>I&#x27;m not asking for discussion about crypto issues, but kindly if you know some working solutions to circumvent this blockage with the fewest clicks to get to the target, do what has to be done and then leave and forget about it.<p>(One thing is my old hp-printer that needs to be reset for scanning, another is the website of a wordpress installation that seems to frozen in time but unaccessible, etc.)",
