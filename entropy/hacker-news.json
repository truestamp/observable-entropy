With that I could quickly add an event to my calendar by opening Fantastical&#x27;s quick add menu (a single click in the mac menubar, or a keyboard shortcut) and typing a natural language description of the event &quot;Call with Mike tomorrow at 10am EST&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m finding a lot of friction when trying to add events in Linux. So far, the only ways I really have are to open up Evolution, which is very bulky for such a quick task, or open the Nextcloud calendar web app, which also takes quite a bit of time.<p>Are there any faster always-on tools for adding an event to a calendar in Linux with a single keyboard shortcut or click? Any good menu-bar apps for interacting with calendars? What do you use?",
