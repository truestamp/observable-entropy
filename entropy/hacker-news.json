I learned a lot from their writing.<p>I look back at those days as the golden age of programmer writing. Super smart people who wrote very well.<p>Nowadays I feel like there is simply no new content that compares to the quality of these blogs&#x2F;web sites. Why is this so? Or am I mistaken and there is a thriving blogging community I somehow overlooked?",

      "text": "I&#x27;m the founder of a startup that is building cool things™ with web technologies. The dev team, including myself, is quite junior and we don&#x27;t have the budget to hire a senior developer full time, yet. It would be great to get feedback on crucial design decisions and code quality from someone more experienced than I am (most senior person, but also responsible for most business tasks), even if it were only a couple of hours per week or 1-2 days per month. I went to freelancer market places (e.g. upwork), but this kind of job requires a lot of interaction with the client – in the end, it&#x27;s almost teaching – and that doesn&#x27;t seem to be in high demand. Are there people specialized not only in providing feedback and training to teams of junior devs, but also providing that as a service?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth: mostly Vue, Node, Python, AWS, Docker, Postgres, Mongo (esp. migration to Postgres :D)",
