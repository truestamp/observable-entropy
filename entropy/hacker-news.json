(You get it)<p>but the simplicity in this is that you have a standard struct, a pyramid of supports, and a mech to affect the height of pyrmid, and rotation of pendulum printer head at minimal cost of energy....<p>You have a motor with a small solar input... But you have an external engine that supplies the resources to the printer...<p>The printer is easily scalable in size... but requires a lot of energy on the outside to produce...<p>But you feed it plans, and it will squirt out the shape, as long as it fits under it&#x27;s struts that house the pendulum...<p>So as long as you can slurp &quot;earthen&quot; (or martian&quot; soiled content into the system and keep the pendulum spinning... it can print....",
