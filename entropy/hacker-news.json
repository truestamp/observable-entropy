Sadly, I used to love DO for their balanced pricing, range of services, docs, online written material. I <i>thought</i> they were among the best of the best.<p>Long story short, I&#x27;ve had an account with them for roughly 5+ years as I recall, <i>good</i> credit card on file, monthly bill around $20-50, US address.  I use a few droplets to run dokku&#x2F;docker containers for dev and 1 private Google Outline VPN endpoint, only for me.  I only ssh into these from non-root and root should be turned off completely (but I&#x27;m only a hacker and not a F&#x2F;T systems person).<p>Not sure if it matters but I don&#x27;t do anything nefarious on these droplets-- no webscraping, no botnet creation, no crypto mining.  I don&#x27;t know what else would be considered verboten!?!<p>Try to log in with github, won&#x27;t work and asks for email login.  Try to login from there, and it asks for credit card info for &quot;authorization&quot; although the card is the one on file and being charged for so many years.<p>No recourse, and what a crappy way to treat clients even if they are small potatoes in the grand scheme of things.  Thankfully I am building a new MVP all on AWS and have my company prod there too running for 5 years. So I don&#x27;t have to put up with unprofessional dealings and major risks of service interruption.<p>Assume through no fault of your own that you could be shut out of everything.  You have been warned.",
