      "text": "My wife has a potential job opportunity in Auckland next year and we’re considering moving (with our two small children).<p>Our current quality of life in the US is pretty high, but we’re not very optimistic about the near future here. The move would be primarily aimed at giving our kids an opportunity to grow up with more nature, a better social safety net, and a (broadly speaking, I know) more tolerant society.<p>Background: family identifies as 75% Asian. We’re English speakers and have lived overseas before, but never in NZ. I would plan on finding remote work once we’ve moved.<p>Anyone have any experience on moving, living, or working in NZ? Especially with children?",
