      "text": "How do you cross the bridge between Knowing and Practicing?<p>I know what I should do, but practicing is quite a different story.<p>I make plans and lists, but then I fail to take action.<p>When I find myself in a stressful situation, my anxiety takes over and I react angrily, instead of responding appropriately. In a nutshell, I have the “Nice Guy Syndrome” where I constantly fail to set and maintain proper healthy boundaries, and then with time I get tired of people overstepping their boundaries and I get self-righteous and I do act like an asshole.<p>And my subconscious justifies it by playing the victim’s card, because I failed to maintain healthy boundaries I am justified in being angry.<p>I know it stems from anxiety, but I do not want to use that as an excuse, I want to use this knowledge to improve and overcome my anxiety.<p>What I have done and tried so far:<p>- Therapy: I was in therapy for Severe Clinical Depression for over 2 years, after about 1 year I was diagnosed “Depression-Free”. Looking in retrospect I didn’t have Depression, it was just that my life sucked. And why did my life sucked? Because of all the reasons described above, at that time I was unaware and clueless of my MO.<p>- Meditation: I practiced Zen for about 5 years, for 5 years I medidated an average of 10 hours&#x2F;week, plus other Zen practice.<p>- Blogging and other forms of writings.<p>- I have read so many books: Feeling Good (David Burns), nost of the REBT books (Albert Ellis), and many more.<p>I have come a long way, but I also have a long way to go.<p>What I am looking for:<p>- Honest feedback<p>- Actionable feedback<p>- Practice(s) that I can start<p>Thanks in advance",
