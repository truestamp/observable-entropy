      "text": "It feels to me like a pretty substantial sea change is happening in Chinese politics right now given the crackdown on large companies, the crack down on for profit education, the crackdown on video games, the 3 child policy, changing posturing on Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. For many other topics I have go to youtube channels or blogs I&#x27;d go to to learn about it but I&#x27;m not coming up with a lot of great resources on this. I&#x27;m not looking for a politicized narrative, more like a detached analysis of the situation. Does anyone have any recommendations? I&#x27;m especially interested in long form monologue or dialogue youtube content.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m actively not looking to debate Chinese politics in the thread and asking others to refrain as well. It seems like there is no shortage of threads to endless fight about China on here recently, not looking to make another one. My goal is only to get tips on resources.",
