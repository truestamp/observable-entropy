      "text": "I built a WhatsApp chat bot(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aibuddy.chat&#x2F;) that uses GPT-3 to hold a pretty decent conversation (Users have to bring their own OpenAI keys). It holds a memory of last 5 conversations currently.<p>Few planned improvements in near future.\n- Running this for WhatsApp is a bit expensive for both myself and the users), So the next plan is built this for telegram.\n- Let users choose different personas for the AI. \n- Let users choose how much conversation memory they want the bot to hold for them(more memory means more tokens means bigger bill from OpenAI)\n- Let users bring in their own data to fine-tune GPT-3 for a custom bot. For example, a bot trained on a writer&#x27;s work or even your own.<p>I can hook people up with some codes to try it out: just drop an email at aibuddy.chat@gmail.com",
