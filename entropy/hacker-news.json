      "text": "I created a application (B) which handles extra functionalities and I want to receive from old legacy app (A) some metadata needed and I was thinking about implementing a straight implementation due to application infra limitations (I know it&#x27;s possible to implement event bus like rabbitmq or kafka but for the limitations imposed by this project I have to stick with only RESTful API). Basically, I was thinking about an approach which consists of exposing POST resource in service (B) which is consumed by service (A) in order to get metadata and create a session in (A) and in response I want to redirect user from service (A) to service (B). how is it possible to keep on track user journey while reserving sessions between these 2 apps and data in session. Long story short, I want using RESTful API to reserve user session info back and forth between these 2 apps. both apps are running PHP Frameworks",
