      "text": "Hm hello!<p>I just encountered a problem today and I&#x27;m not sure what to make of it.<p>I bought a new phone that was delivered today and used smart switch to move the apps and accounts from my old phone to the new one.<p>When I went to instagram I saw that it was logged into an unknown account. I then checked it out and saw that it was the account of my friend&#x27;s sister.<p>This was extremely surprising and weird as there are the following thigs to be mentioned:\n- i never met my friend&#x27;s sister\n- the sister lives in another country.\n- there&#x27;s no chance that my friend would have logged in on my old phone with her sister&#x27;s account ( there was never a need for it + she doesn&#x27;t know her sister&#x27;s account + it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense).\n- my friend might have logged in with her google account on my phone at some point (neither of us remembers this, but we just take it as a possibility), but she doesn&#x27;t have her sister&#x27;s account saved in her google.\n- my friend doesn&#x27;t have her sister&#x27;s account on her phone.\n- I am the first time owner of both phones.<p>I tried to remove the account, but so far it failed. Each time it logs out, the option to log in still appears, even after pressing on remove&#x2F;forget account.<p>It says that the account is saved with &quot;Google Smart Lock&quot;, but when looking at the saved accounts we couldn&#x27;t find the sister&#x27;s account there.<p>Any view on this is highly appreciated.",
