      "text": "For context, the codebase I&#x27;m working on is a big ball of mud. Normally, I can map code in my head. But a lot of it is unintuitive, and there are pockets of repeated and hacky code. Boundaries are strictly written in some places, and non-existent in others. There&#x27;s tons of global objects just stored in memory somewhere. A lot of stuff is labeled &quot;item_&quot; and in some generic folder.<p>So I&#x27;d like to draw the architecture to clearly visualize what the architecture currently is, and what it should be. I&#x27;d also like to &quot;zoom&quot; a level, e.g. identify the purpose of a layer, then the implementation of it, and implementations and relations around certain subclasses.<p>I think something like draw.io does the trick, but I figure there are better tools out there. A mind mapping tool could also work, but I haven&#x27;t found any that I&#x27;m more comfortable with over pen and paper.",
