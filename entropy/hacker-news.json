      "text": "Last February, we launched https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26248123 on HN the first version of weweb.io &lt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;weweb.io&#x2F;&gt;. Since then, we made a slight pivot and wanted to let the community know about it.<p>The tool was initially meant to let people visually build static websites&#x27; front-ends on top of any headless system. Between March and this summer, we received tons of feedback which led us to turn WeWeb into a visual front-end builder for web-applications, not only websites.<p>It means that users can build their front-end with a Webflow like editor + add authentication (with Auth0), do CRUD with data from their back-end (SQL DB, REST API, Airtable) and create front-end workflows using custom variables and JS functions.<p>Also, when setting up collections of data in a project, users can now choose if the data will be dynamically fetched on the client-side or statically stored in the front-end.<p>It took us 5 months to turn WeWeb into this new version. Although it&#x27;s still in beta, we think it&#x27;s time to launch it publicly - and there&#x27;s no better place than HN to get started :)<p>Please fire your comments at us, the last launch generated a tremendous response.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear about the difficulties you may have encountered when creating the front-end of a web-app (Time to build? Speed of iteration? Performance issues? Difficult back-end integration? Etc.). Based on your experiences, we could do the exercise of determining whether visual programming could have helped solve these problems.<p>We would also love to hear your feedback about the new version of the tool. You are welcome to give it a spin at &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weweb.io&gt;",
