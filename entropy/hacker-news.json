      "text": "I would like to hire a Bitcoin Core Developer to teach me how to modify the Bitcoin Core Source Code, from tag v22.0,  to implement a blockchain design with a different PoW scheme than sha2 hashing. This would involve writing and giving me a presentation on parameters, functions, files that need to be changed as well as coding the a new design. The goal is to go through one example with a different PoW in its entirety so that I can learn how that is done.<p>Compensation is negotiable. It can be on an hourly basis, or as a whole. The hourly rate would be $100&#x2F;hour. I would imagine for a core developer who is intimately familiar with the source code this work would take less than 16 hours. I am a software developer. Languages mastery in order: C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Python&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;x86_asm&#x2F;Haskell --yes, x86 assembly is easier than Haskell :P.<p>Thank you.",
