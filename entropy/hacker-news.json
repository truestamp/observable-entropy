Or should I go with service meshes since they have tools to do distributed tracing in place, but may increase the complexity even more, like AWS App Mesh, Istio (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;istio.io&#x2F;latest&#x2F;), Consul (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consul.io&#x2F;) or Linkerd (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkerd.io&#x2F;).<p>What do you use?
