Our stack is very simple: Rails&#x2F;Heroku&#x2F;Redis&#x2F;Postgres<p>I spend time reading about larger scale systems and watching talks about how big companies have scaled their products and the challenges they face and its given me a general understanding about some scaling techniques.<p>Is there some way i can try to implement some of these things and test to make sure that the way i implemented it works without having to spend a bunch of money?<p>For example if i want to try making a distributed cache, test sharding a database, create a messaging queue and test it, how can i do this?",
