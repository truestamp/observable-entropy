Have a system.\n2. Use the surrounding information to always <i>tell</i> you how to access your password (or other important information).<p>The only requirement for the system is that it is <i>consistent</i>. \nOnce you start using it, you can&#x27;t change it.\nIf you want to change it, you have to start fresh.<p>For example, a system can be: ${constantSpecial1}${context}${constantSpecial2}...\nBy using this the only thing you need to remember is the ${constantSpecial1} and ${constantSpecial2}. \nMake them as complex and as easy to remember as you can.<p>What I mean by use the surrounding information? \nIf you&#x27;re logging into a website, the website is always known to you.\nYou can&#x27;t forget that, because, it&#x27;s the website name.\nSo in conjunction with the system, you can always have a unique password for a unique website.<p>Examples:\nSystem - veryWeak${context}123<p>Passwords:\n...\nLog into Facebook: veryWeakFacebook123\nLog into HN: veryWeakHackerNews123\nLog into BBC: veryWeakBBCNews123\n...<p>By using these simple rules, it&#x27;s quite impossible to forget your passwords. \nYou also have a unique password for all services.<p>Hope this was interesting!<p>P.S. \nIf you&#x27;re logging into a shady website, which does not seem trustworthy, use a simple password (password1), to check if they do anything shady.\nOnly after confirmation use your real password.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shkspr.mobi&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;ive-locked-myself-out-of-my-digital-life&#x2F;",
