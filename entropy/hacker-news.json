      "text": "Back in the 90s, we used to have CRT monitors, and they almost always had physical&#x2F;mechanical dials for brightness&#x2F;contrast settings. I&#x27;m prone to headaches looking at bright screens, so I often need to have different brightness&#x2F;contrast settings in the day time vs night time. They were really convenient.<p>Nowadays - laptops are OK in this case because there&#x27;s usually buttons on the keyboard to quickly adjust brightness.<p>For desktop PCs, every LCD&#x2F;LED monitor I&#x27;ve owned has brightness&#x2F;contrast settings buried in software menus. It makes it very hard to adjust brightness&#x2F;contrast on a regular basis. I rely on night light settings (bluelight filters) in software to help myself feel better without having to fiddle with the monitor&#x27;s menu (which is always really cumbersome to use).<p>Are there LCE&#x2F;LED monitors with physical dials, or at a minimum dedicated physical buttons for brightness&#x2F;contrast (and not buried within menus with buttons labeled &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, etc.)?",
