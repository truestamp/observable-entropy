      "text": "Here&#x27;s a fun little project I did today on a whim. I happen to have access to the OpenAI API, so I used their playground feature to generate AI headlines with their taglines. I fed it this prompt:<p>&#x27;Last week&#x27;s top AI news: \n* Caltech unit creates AI helping drones to withstand violent winds - &quot;Caltech researchers are developing a drone with rapidly reacting artificial intelligence (AI) capacities that allow it to adapt in flight to extreme wind similar to tornado or hurricane conditions.&quot;<p>* How Deep Squeak, an AI program with a weird name, is detecting whales - &quot;Artificial Intelligence is booming. And now an AI program is being used to search for whales.&quot; &quot;<p>Plug alert: this text sourced from the latest edition of the Last Week in AI newsletter (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lastweekin.ai&#x2F;) which I co-run. So here&#x27;s what it got just generating text given that prompt:<p>* Google’s DeepMind creates AI that can beat humans at hide-and-seek - &quot;A new artificial intelligence program developed by Google’s DeepMind can beat humans at hide-and-seek, according to a new paper.&quot;<p>* Carnegie Mellon Researchers Develop AI System That Can Help You Write Better Emails - &quot;Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed an artificial intelligence system that can help you write better emails.&quot;<p>* New AI System Can Help You Find a Job You’ll Love - &quot;A new artificial intelligence system developed by researchers at the University of Toronto can help you find a job you’ll love, according to a new study.&quot;<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, quite good. Though, I was surprised to find it repeats itself super quickly. Would have thought GPT-3 had solved this very basic language model problem... It also seems to repeat actual news stories from the past, such as:<p>* Google DeepMind&#x27;s AlphaGo Zero AI can teach itself Go and other games in hours - &quot;DeepMind has created an artificial intelligence system that can not only defeat humans at the game of Go, but also teach itself to play from scratch within hours.&quot;<p>I also tried prompting it with just &quot;Last week&#x27;s top AI news&quot; and got the following:<p>1. Google&#x27;s DeepMind has created a new algorithm that can predict how proteins will fold.<p>2. Facebook&#x27;s artificial intelligence research lab has developed a new system that can automatically generate 3D models of objects from 2D images.<p>3. IBM has announced that its Watson AI platform will now be available to developers on the IBM Cloud.<p>Again, repeating facts from the past. Lastly, how about &quot;This week&#x27;s trending AI papers&quot; as a prompt. Also not bad:<p>1. &quot;Deep Learning for Recommender Systems&quot;<p>2. &quot;A Neural Network Approach to Context-Aware Query Suggestion&quot;<p>3. &quot;Learning Deep Representations of Fine-Grained Visual Concepts&quot;<p>A while back I fine-tuned GPT-2 on 100 weeks&#x27; worth of AI news (and released the dataset+colab notebook, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.skynettoday.com&#x2F;digests&#x2F;ai-news-analysis), and got some comparatively more amusing stuff:<p>&quot;Researchers develop a traffic light for self-driving cars  - A pair of new papers from University of Tokyo Institute of  Technology researchers and the World Health Organization claim to have  addressed one of the great challenges of artificial intelligence:  traffic lights.<p>How I used NLP&#x27;s GPT-3 to write the AI I Created  - When it comes to creating AI, there are 2 main choices I have:-  write a clean code or- just use the output from the original app to  clean code.<p>Meet Microsoft&#x27;s first AI-powered coffee machine - Jeff Dean, chair of Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI)  division, recently sat down with WIRED senior writer Will Knight to  discuss the value of building products that do a lot of good, but don’t  always do much of anything else.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s about it, nothing too fancy but kind of fun. Feel free to suggest other little experiments to try!",
