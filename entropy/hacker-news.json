      "text": "I have 7-8 years of experience as a software dev. Currently I am pondering if I should take the step to become a freelancer at some point in the near future. I was self-employed before but that were special conditions. (I am located in Germany if that matters.)<p>My main questions are: how do you realize this change? Do you try to find contracts before leaving your day job? Where&#x2F;How do you find work?<p>I know the most common platforms but are there some rules you should follow on there?<p>Do I have to suck it up and offer my service for &quot;cheap&quot; in the beginning? Or should I only take jobs for my self-defined minimum even if it&#x27;s my first?<p>What else should I consider?",
