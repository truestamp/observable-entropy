      "text": "We see many hot SaaS applications every day.\nlike loom, MilkVideo, and Descript.\nBut I&#x27;m curious how they set their prices and why does it make sense? 8$&#x2F;month or 20$&#x2F;m seems too cheap. If they use Google&#x27;s speech to test API, probably they can not make any money. even if they have their own API, there are another costs like AWS and others cloud services.",
