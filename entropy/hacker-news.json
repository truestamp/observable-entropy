      "text": "Hey HN! We’ve created Mood Surf, a discovery engine to explore topics that intrigue you. We miss the days you could stumble upon weird, wonderful, human-authored pages on the Web. Twitter threads are similarly niche and personal but so much good content gets lost in the algorithmic timeline.<p>So we built Mood Surf to explore the conversations that you might not have found otherwise. Click “Shuffle” to jump into a random corner topic space. Click “Dive Deeper” to go down the rabbit hole of similar threads.<p>Technical details:<p>We ran graph analysis on the tech&#x2F;startup-adjacent subset of Twitter graph to find the top contributors within a given niche. We extracted each user’s threads and embedded them using sentence transformers [0]. The “dive deeper” functionality is powered by approximate nearest neighbor lookup using Pinecone [1]<p>We hope you like the product — share with us any feedback you have!<p>— The folks at Re:Search<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbert.net&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sbert.net&#x2F;</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinecone.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinecone.io&#x2F;</a>",
