      "text": "I own two Lexus SUVs, a 2002 RX300 and a 2013 GX460. The best mileage I can coax out of the 3700 lb 6 cyl RX300 is about 21 mpg. If I drive the 5100 lb V8 GX460 below 75 mph, I get about 20 mpg.  How can this be?  The GX460 is heavier, bigger, boxier, and has an engine 50% bigger, yet gets about the same mileage. What is my RX300 doing wrong?",
