This is to avoid clumping that you&#x27;ll see if you use Dijkstra&#x27;s or flow fields (since these return only one available path). I will also use this for cars, so the algorithm must handle weighted and directed edges.<p>I have created my own solution, but I&#x27;m always looking for more optimal algorithms.",
