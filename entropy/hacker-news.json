I&#x27;m mainly talking about the incorporation, regulatory and legal process to move from an idea to launch a service that can capture and lend money.<p>Where do people start? Do they go to a lawyer and how do you find the right one?<p>I would really appreciate any information that can shed some light on this topic.",
