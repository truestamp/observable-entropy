      "text": "I’m thinking of pursuing a project to improve embedded device security for enterprises. It seems like a weak spot in cyber security to me.<p>However, I’m looking for some insight into how enterprise security people and embedded developers think about this topic before I dive in.<p>Replies here would be awesome and much appreciated. However, I’m hoping I can tempt you into a deeper conversation over email with the following… First, I haven’t written a line of code so I don’t have anything to sell (yet). Second, I’m an experienced software developer on cyber security products so I should be able to contribute to an interesting conversation on the topic.<p>Thanks for reading.\nMy email is in my bio.",
