      "text": "I’m excited to share Master the Code Review: forge a better process, give better reviews, write better code.<p>It’s a video course with 4+ hours of content [1]. I’ve linked a 21-minute sample below [2].<p>6 years ago, I began my software engineering career at Amazon Web Services. I struggled with Pull Requests.  My authored PRs received many comments, sometimes 50+. They went through many revisions, sometimes 7+. I often shipped late. My reviews of other PRs were surface level and counterproductive.<p>Long story short: I improved. Through trial, error and experience I learned how to be effective in all 3 dimensions of code reviews: process, reviewer, and author.<p>I came to realize that there isn’t much information out there, giving developers actionable guidance to succeed in a code review environment. Doing so takes specific soft skills, social skills, and technical skills. Very few people talk about them.<p>Late 2020, I started writing about code reviews on my Medium, Twitter [3] and LinkedIn. I grew from 0 to almost 17K followers across platforms. The internet held me accountable for ambiguities and inaccuracies of my public writing. I learned a lot, and leveraged both positive and negative feedback to refine my ideas.<p>My writing experience gave me the confidence to build the course. I created it for my younger self, and I hope developers everywhere find it useful.<p>I launched it a month ago. So far there have been more than 650 students. I’ve received positive feedback from senior managers and principal engineers across big tech.<p>Happy to answer questions!<p>[1] Course: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curtiseinsmann.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;code-review-course<p>[2] Sample video — Writing effective code review comments: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.gumroad.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;90c67f7093db4dd0d544187b0a29bccf&#x2F;vcisZ5CTogObOj95pBKvHQ==<p>[3] Example Twitter thread: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;curtiseinsmann&#x2F;status&#x2F;1317149417330364421?s=20&amp;t=q4gYZPN4BhXDrHtcTTiHmA",
