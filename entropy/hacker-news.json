      "text": "Hi there!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on (and using) a command-line utility for Atlassian Jira for the past few months. The initial release is available now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ankitpokhrel&#x2F;jira-cli&#x2F;releases<p>Project Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ankitpokhrel&#x2F;jira-cli<p>Some of the features include:<p>1. Interactive mode + an option to easily integrate with shell&#x2F;automation scripts using standard POSIX-complaint flags.<p>2. Easy search and navigation. For instance, you can easily search for something like &quot;Issues that are of high priority, is in progress, was created this month, and has a label called backend&quot; with `jira issue list -yHigh -s&quot;In Progress&quot; --created month -lbackend`<p>3. Create a neat Jira ticket (and comment) using Github-flavored + Jira-flavored markdown as a template. Supports pre-defined templates.<p>4. The ticket details are translated to markdown from the Atlassian document and is  beautifully displayed on the screen when you view it.<p>5. Easy sprint and epic navigation. You can quickly view tickets in previous, current, and next sprint tickets using flags like --prev, --next, and --current eg: `jira sprint list --current`.<p>6. Fast and straightforward ticket cloning with the ability to replace text in summary and description.\n7. You can edit, link, assign and transition the issues with ease.<p>Check out the project for more details: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ankitpokhrel&#x2F;jira-cli<p>Your suggestions and feedback is highly appreciated. Feel free to start a discussion or create an issue to share your experience about the tool or to discuss a feature&#x2F;issue.",
