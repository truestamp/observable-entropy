      "text": "How is everyone doing their smoke testing? My hierarchy of test value basically goes:<p>- Live usage test<p>- Smoke tests<p>- E2E tests<p>- Integration tests<p>- Unit tests<p>And the likelihood of implementation in projects I work on is:<p>- Live usage tests (sanity checks, figuring out if the product flow is what I envisioned)<p>- E2E tests (more commonly for backend projects -- for an API this is basically the only way to ensure quality&#x2F;functionality&#x2F;prevent regression)<p>- Integration tests (I get worried about two components actually working together properly)<p>- Unit tests (I generally ignore these, type system does 80% of the work for me)\n- Smoke tests<p>How is everyone running smoke tests in an automated fashion? All you really &quot;need&quot; is 3 things:<p>- An alert when a staging&#x2F;production deploy completes\n- A way to run the test (web-triggerable CI is everywhere now)\n- (optional) affordances on the app side to set up&#x2F;teardown state quickly or avoid heavy processes etc.<p>I&#x27;m  curious what others are doing for this, and what automation&#x2F;backdoors they put in place. Feels like something I&#x27;m overlooking too much these days.",
