      "text": "Let&#x27;s say you have have a large-ish database table of product orders, and you&#x27;d like to allow users to query it with an API, using several different filter and sort options, and of course supporting pagination.<p>What would be the best strategy to optimize such query? Creating an index for every possible combination of options doesn&#x27;t seem practical. How do large companies handle queries like [0], with 20 different filters and 10 different sort options?<p>In our particular case, we use a MySQL db in AWS RDS.<p>Tangentially, can you recommend any good books&#x2F;resources with real-world usage patterns, and examples of the entire process of analyzing and solving database-related problems in growing web applications? Ideally written from the problem perspective, rather than just a reference of available db functionalities.<p>Thanks!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shopify.dev&#x2F;api&#x2F;admin-graphql&#x2F;2022-01&#x2F;objects&#x2F;Product#query-products",
