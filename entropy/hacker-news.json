It&#x27;s worth checking your contract for clauses about &quot;hold liable&quot; and &quot;indemnify&quot;.<p>I had foolishly assumed I understood &quot;indemnify&quot; to mean &quot;you can&#x27;t seek money from us if we damage you&quot; whereas it actually means &quot;we will sue you into the ground if we feel like it&quot;.<p>Since international remote work often involves operating as a contractor for the company in question they might give you a generic contractor contract where you are assumed to have Liability&#x2F;Errors &amp; Omissions insurance but if you&#x27;re working for a single company you may not.",
