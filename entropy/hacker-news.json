What we&#x27;re doing now is we develop a Spark-SQL job for each table. But we think this is not gonna scale because every time we want to add new dimension, we need to develop the Spark-SQL job again (same logic but different group by dimension)<p>So I&#x27;m wondering whether there&#x27;s a better way to do this. Anyone has any experience with this kind of problem before? Any pointer how to do this efficiently (I&#x27;m thinking someone could just specify the dimension they need and there&#x27;ll be a script where it&#x27;ll automatically generate the new table based on the specified dimension)<p>Thanks",
