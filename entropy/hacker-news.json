      "text": "I spent many years working on the JVM, working with Java and then later working with Clojure. I am used to that world and its culture. It is a world full of books and essays with interesting debates about key issues of software architecture. I&#x27;m now switching over to the world of NodeJS, but I can&#x27;t find the books or essays written to the same depth of detail. I&#x27;d like some pointers.<p>Just to take one issue. How should exceptions be managed? There was a long debate, in the world of the JVM, about whether exceptions should be handled as locally as possible to the point of the error, or whether it was simpler and cleaner, from the point of view of architecture, to let most exceptions bubble up to the top and handle all of them in one place. I personally favored handling errors locally, but I learned a lot by reading both sides of the debate.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble finding conversations like that, regarding NodeJS. Has there been a debate about best practice? Where can I find it?<p>Also, performance tuning. I have the impression that NodeJS is a bit more magical than the JVM, therefore discussions of performance tuning are considered besides the point in the world of NodeJS. Whereas the JVM offers a thousand configuration options, NodeJS seems to offer fewer. Is that correct? Where are good resources on this subject?",
