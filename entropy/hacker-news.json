      "text": "I would like to start my own business but if history is anything to show, I&#x27;m pretty terrible at it. I&#x27;ve built product after product and none of them have ever gained any traction. At some point I realized that I&#x27;m looking for solutions to problems that don&#x27;t exist instead of trying to build solutions for actual problems.<p>I&#x27;m now at a point where I realize I&#x27;m never going to get anywhere with this if I don&#x27;t start talking to potential customers first. But I don&#x27;t know how to find potential customers, because I don&#x27;t even know what kind of business I&#x27;m trying to build. I just want to build something, anything.<p>So, successful software business folks out there, what do you do? Do you cold call random businesses in your area and ask what type of software they use and what are their pain points? Do you schedule time with these business owners to try and find out what could possibly help their business? Do you do this without the slightest clue of what you want to build?",
