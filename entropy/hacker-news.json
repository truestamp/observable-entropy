      "text": "So I support Ukrainians in their fight against the Russian aggression. There are multiple ways to do so and I decided to donate money.<p>There are at least two possible options: the official central UA account and some smaller scale actions organized by people who I reasonably trust.<p>My thinking so far:<p>Pro central account - pooling resources means they may have more leverage in buying stuff wholesale. Also, they have the global view so can direct the support where it&#x27;s needed the most.<p>Pro local actions - they work directly with Ukrainian units and know what is needed locally. Small scale also means they can scrape the long tail of resources like buying a used truck from a local person.<p>Neither seems like a very clear win, so I split randomly.<p>Any thoughts on addressing this (admittedly not very precisely defined) optimization problem?",
