      "text": "Apple turned the industry upside down with the M1 at the end of 2020 but we’re almost halfway through 2022 and the new M1 Ultra has the same single core performance as the M1 from 2020.<p>The flag is Intel i9 is already +20% faster than the M1 in single core. The M2 comes out at the end of this year at the earliest. The M2 is based on the A15 from the iPhone, which was 10% fast in single core over the A14, which the M1 was based on.<p>Do you guys think Apple is in trouble when Intel gets their stuff together and makes their chips more efficient?",
