The team isn’t good at making itself appear appealing (they exclusively use Comic Sans in every document) and I’m not looking to change that. I just want to understand how people work and apply those skills.<p>Peter Thiel says that marketing is really important to startups. The skills required to make something attractive seem to extend past startups and into understanding how social structures and people work. Basic competency in this seems required to have conversations that make people think I’m not a robot.<p>To rephrase this: how do people work? and what makes them find something interesting or cool?<p>Thanks!",
