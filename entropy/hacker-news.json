How would robocallers get this information — interception, buying it from my cell phone company, or something else?<p>Even if they&#x27;re just buying a list of area codes I&#x27;ve talked to, this seems completely inappropriate. And if they&#x27;re getting the actual numbers, that&#x27;s even worse.",
