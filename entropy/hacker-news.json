      "text": "Hello, I&#x27;m Aaron.<p>I hold a BS in ChemE, but my day-job is teaching English in China - I think I do a good job. Also I write fiction at my website.<p>For several years, I&#x27;ve made little projects on the web, mostly in PHP and JavaScript, for example: a game where people &quot;invest&quot; in subreddits like stocks [1], a reddit-like-commenting system [2], my own website [3], etc.<p>How could I transition to a remote web-developer job most effectively?<p>Coding boot-camp?\nCrank through job-boards and applications?\nGo through an online MS in CS?<p>My coding is not strong, but I can get stuff to work in PHP and JavaScript, and I can use web APIs fairly well. I&#x27;m lacking in skill and knowledge, but I hope to remedy that.<p>So, if you have a suggestion for how I might most effectively improve and hopefully even be remunerated, I&#x27;d be grateful to hear your thoughts. Thank you.<p>[1] paaronmitchell.com&#x2F;karmakarma\n[2] github.com&#x2F;aaron5m&#x2F;rlc\n[3] paaronmitchell.com",
