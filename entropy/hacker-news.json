      "text": "I have been chipping away at the problem of packet loss during TCP&#x2F;IP data transfer for the last 19 years. I am new to HN – Greetings<p>I created this tool (Netpump Data) to optimise the size of packet segments and use nonlinear data transfer to reduce  the  risk  of  access  congestion,  enable  accelerated  delivery,  and access the  latent  capacity  of  available  bandwidth.<p>By “nonlinear data transfer”, I mean that files are segmented and transmitted through different ports (or sockets), as opposed to TCP&#x2F;IP, which is a linear transfer through a single port.<p>I’ve found that I can get speeds usually around 2x to 5x faster than TCP&#x2F;IP (but up to around 15x).<p>I am looking for some people to test my observations &#x2F; assumptions, provide feedback and explore use-cases with me.<p>Netpump Data must be installed on both ends of the transfer, so it is most appropriate for enterprise networks. Theoretically, it could become a consumer product, but this has not yet been built.<p>I have a Demo User Guide [1] which provides instructions on how to use Netpump Data in a test environment I’ve set up across 5 servers on the Azure Cloud.  There is also an Admin Guide [2] which goes into further detail concerning implementing Netpump Data in other TCP&#x2F;IP environments.<p>To give you dedicated time on our test environment to demo the software, if you’re interested, please get started using this Typeform [3] and I will provide you a unique User ID and password to gain access to our Azure servers.<p>My website, contact information and FAQs are at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.netpump.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.netpump.com&#x2F;</a><p>If you’d like to know how I made this, have any feedback, or discuss how it might be used, I’ll be around to respond to any queries and comments.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pacbyte.com&#x2F;user_guides&#x2F;Netpump%20Data%20Azure%20Testing%20Guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pacbyte.com&#x2F;user_guides&#x2F;Netpump%20Data%20Azure%2...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pacbyte.com&#x2F;user_guides&#x2F;Netpump%20Data%20-%20Administration%20Guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pacbyte.com&#x2F;user_guides&#x2F;Netpump%20Data%20-%20Adm...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;7zwtzlao1bg.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;YNhhLKgI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;7zwtzlao1bg.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;YNhhLKgI</a>",

      "text": "Facebook&#x27;s Katran looked too scary (and I don&#x27;t do C++), so I thought I would investigate using XDP&#x2F;eBPF to redirect packets at high speed and Go to do the control plane work of health-checking backed servers and managing configuration. With luck the resulting binary should be easy to deploy by non-developers.<p>It&#x27;s still not mature, but seems to work. Code was written in a very exploratory manner, and I&#x27;m not a developer\nso it is quite shocking at the moment, but I aim to improve it. It is intended to be horizontally scalable with ECMP and has been tested on service providing 40Gb&#x2F;s with a single (hardware) node at ~30% CPU utilisation.",
