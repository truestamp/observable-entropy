This left me with no other choice than to quit my job and move out of the US.<p>I&#x27;d still like to be able to do the same while living in the US, and if I could find someone to hire me on a part-time H1B that would work wonderfully for me.<p>I wasn&#x27;t even sure if this was possible and I&#x27;m mainly going by articles like this one:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.immihelp.com&#x2F;part-time-h-1b-visa&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;ve not heard of anyone be hired on a part-time H1B ever though. Does anyone know of companies that might be open to this?<p>I think this could be a great way to be able to hire some engineers you normally wouldn&#x27;t be able to hire, so I&#x27;m surprised companies don&#x27;t try to do this more often.",

But there are some practical skills that can be learned in a couple of hours and refreshed with an hour of practice every month or so, but that have a disproportionate return on investment.<p>Two examples of skills that I regularly find useful are classical lockpicking and knowing how to tie a variety of knots. The first has gotten me and friends out of jams when someone lost a key and got locked out, etc.; and if you don’t know knots you will never be able to tie a load tightly to the roof of your car.<p>What skills do you recommend that I add to my repertoire?",
