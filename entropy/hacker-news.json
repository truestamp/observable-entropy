      "text": "I&#x27;ve had some success predicting world events, but nothing has come of it because I&#x27;ve utterly failed to identify secondary effects. Those secondary effects seem obvious in retrospect, but I never got there in my thinking. Is there a community of predictors who get together and bounce ideas off each other? I&#x27;m thinking specifically of the process described in &quot;Scrum&quot; where Dalkey and Helmer of Rand sought predictions from experts, but then analyzed the factors used in those predictions to repeat the process and achieve a high level of confidence. (Maybe the process is called a Delphi Exercise?)\nNot only would such a community help me refine practical decisions out of my predictions (and subject those predictions to rigorous challenge), but I suspect it&#x27;d also be a lot of fun.",
