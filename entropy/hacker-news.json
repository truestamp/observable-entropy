I used clicky in the past but I have no interest in the &quot;privacy first&quot; BS that is now being forced through that service. I need to know which companies have visited the site. I just need &quot;stats that matter&quot;, and not a million over complicated features i&#x27;m not going to use. What are people using for analytics these days, and is there still any great &quot;self hosted&quot; analytics these days?",
