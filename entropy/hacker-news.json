      "text": "At work I&#x27;m 10x more productive on tasks that interest me than on tasks that don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not exaggerating: it&#x27;s the difference between working feverishly, losing track of the time, willfully going past normal work hours because I&#x27;m having fun, vs. struggling to keep myself on track for even a full hour of productivity spread across an entire workday.<p>My manager has a vested interest in me being as productive as possible. But I also want to be a team player, and I don&#x27;t know how to say &quot;I&#x27;ll be most effective if you give me the tasks I enjoy and not the ones I don&#x27;t enjoy&quot;, without sounding demanding and self-centered. It doesn&#x27;t help that the things I enjoy include refactoring&#x2F;paying down tech debt, and the ones I least-enjoy include things like integrating third-party marketing scripts. I&#x27;m pretty sure most of the team would feel the same way; so why should I get special treatment? Except that it really is a hamper on my ability to contribute effectively.<p>My company and my manager are generally accommodating and empathetic, focused on being as effective as possible as a team and not on judgement, etc. But I&#x27;m still worried it wouldn&#x27;t come across the right way if I brought this up.<p>Any advice or anecdotes?",
