      "text": "One day I was having a call with my client, and typing at the same time to note down the key points.\nBut my client, got frustrated with my typing noise and said, &quot;Can you please stop typing?&quot; I was so embarrassed that I can&#x27;t even put it into words.\nSo, after the meeting, I went to Google and typed, &quot;Take meeting notes automatically&quot;. It suggested to me a few AI tools or you can say transcription tools. Well for people who don&#x27;t know, transcription tools convert our meeting audio into text.\nI started using the best transcription tool in the market. But then I discovered something hilarious that blew my mind completely. We speak 5000+ words in just 30 minutes meeting, I spent another 25 minutes reading and making short notes out of that transcript.\nAfter a few meetings and wasting my time, I got more frustrated, called my co-founder and asked, &quot;Why can&#x27;t we kill Transcription? It&#x27;s wasting my 30% of working time.&quot; He said we could kill it if we could build an algo that calculates importance for every sentence we speak and put only those sentences as short notes which have a higher threshold.\nThat&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s been a few months, we developed our AI algo to kill Transcription once and for all. Now today 2000+ people stopped wasting time on transcription and use our meeting summarization tool. We call it, Instaminutes. It&#x27;s our baby.<p>Have you been in the same situation with your meetings? Please share your story in the comment.<p>Please upvote it, if you think, we did something good for our startup community.",
