When I joined Reddit, circa 2012, it had its shared of misinformed, poorly researched comments&#x2F;posts like every other internet community, but as long as you stuck to niche subreddits it was mostly downvoted and contained.<p>As the years pass and I pick up new niche interests, my instinct is to turn to Reddit to find like minded individuals, but more and more increasingly I find that misinformed and poorly researched content is becoming the default and taking over the more quality content.<p>Is this everyone else&#x27;s experience with Reddit lately as well or I&#x27;m just becoming more of an asshole as I age? Genuinely curious what others think.",
