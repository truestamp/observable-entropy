      "text": "Hi all,<p>I would like to write a programming language with semantics compatible with Haskell alike languages like F# or OCaml. I would make the prototype in python for all its bindings as I hope I can be more productive even if it has not support for pattern matching and ADTs.<p>The only known guide I know about hundreds of &quot;Make you a Lisp&quot; tutorials and about a &quot;Make you a Haskell&quot; one which is not complete.<p>The only part that scares me a bit is the type system for what I would be afraid to have to recreate a Prolog or something similar (my first thought was to delegate this job to a separate engine during the first proofs of concept but I to report errors properly and advance I will end up having to implement my own, much more complex, system). Also in order to implement proper Effect Systems or Lazy Execution&#x2F;evaluation elegantly.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t exist I also would love some pointers in any other programming language, such as Python, Clojure or OCaml.",
