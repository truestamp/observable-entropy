The other day on a thread I meet an electrician on HN, and TBH I was pleasantly surprised.<p>I might have formed an idea of the stereotypical HN crowd that is too narrow of naive, but now I&#x27;m curious... who are y&#x27;all? I&#x27;m quite aware of the academics, software&#x2F;hardware engineers, founders, etc... but, who else is here? What do you do for a living?<p>I&#x27;ll start, I was a pastor :-) but it wasn&#x27;t until I started in software that I came across this community.<p>How about you?",
