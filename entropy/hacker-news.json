      "text": "So most Americans seem to be doing that whole “pro Ukraine” thing. And good for them I guess. I’m taking a neutral stance on this one though and I see many problems with Ukraine and Russia both, but that’s not the point of this post. Why are Americans throwing tantrums over a couple incidents of collateral damage in the war, but not our own people dying? 66k fentanyl overdoses will happen this year. It’s all coming from the border. 46k suicides. And the rest obesity. How come these people never speak up to things that actually matter? Is it media brainwashing? Something else? They called trump so many names when he wanted to protect our border and people. It’s so disgusting to see the hypocrisy. I like games, so I don’t really care that they’re making this all a messed up game of who cares about what, but it just makes no sense. Who’s winning at this point? Because it’s not Americans. I’m very curious as to what y’all think here. The whole “pro democracy” thing comes off as really gross and corrupt. The “pro-democracy” people do and support the nastiest things just for political reasons. I hate liars. And I don’t mean innocent lies, I mean gross purely political lies, because not at lies (or omissions) are really bad things. Is it low self confidence on America’s end though? Why is everyone so deluded.",
