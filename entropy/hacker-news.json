      "text": "Let us gather in root comments some annoying things in browsers which in theory might be disabled (by implementing extra switches in settings or by removing&#x2F;adding some code with further compiling on user-side).<p>If you are in the browser developing and you understand what regular people can not understand, second level of comments is for criticism of why it is not possible or maybe for answers that it is possible with &lt;something easy&gt;. Please share annoyances which are applicable only to both of browsers (FF+Chrome). My opinion will be in one of root comments, please sorry that my question is about desktop browsers only, I just don&#x27;t want to know that surfing from either mobile browser or from single-website-app does exist.",

      "text": "I&#x27;m currently in the midst of a pretty substantial non-fiction writing project (a series of critical essays altogether roughly the length of a short book).<p>I&#x27;ve written short essays before, but nothing of this scale. I&#x27;ve developed most of the ideas, fleshed them out, written rough explanations, etc. I know roughly how everything will string together. But I&#x27;m feeling kinda stuck and overwhelmed with the task before me, of assembling everything together, knowing where to put what, concerned whether I&#x27;ll over-explain or repeat myself, etc etc.<p>One particular problem I&#x27;m experiencing is that, while I know and remember all the points I&#x27;m trying to make, I feel like I&#x27;ve kinda &quot;lost touch&quot; with some of them, like I&#x27;m just robotically piecing ideas together. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I hope that makes some sense.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;ll probably figure out some of these things as I go, but it&#x27;d be nice to hear how others have navigated big complex (non-fiction) writing projects like this.<p>So, writers of long-form non-fiction (or non-fiction book writers even): What&#x27;s your process for navigating all this?<p>Thanks!",
