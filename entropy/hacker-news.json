      "text": "I was in Vegas last week and decided to go on a timeshare presentation (obviously for free tickets to a show and free hotel). Here is what I observed and now I&#x27;m trying to understand how this kind of business practice is still operating and if there are any other business that operate in similar manner?<p>1. They lure you into 2 hr sales presentation by offering free tickets and hotels (Which later I realized are not very good)\n2. They make you go through a presentation highlighting how their service is much better than traditional hotels. They talk about inflation and how your money is being wasted using hotels for vacation. (May be using some fancy terms and numbers to influence people)\n3. They pair you with an individual sales rep, who tries to sell you. They highlight benefits, hiding all recurring cost associated with it. Emotionally pressure you into accepting the fact that you are not taking enough vacation and how you are not caring about you and your family&#x27;s need.\n4. They focus on the fact that you &quot;Own&quot; it without explaining how you own anything. \n5. They force you to make decision right then and there. Because the sales agent know that if a customer is interested in buying it there are much better pricing available in secondary market if they do some research.",
