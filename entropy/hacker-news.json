      "text": "Hi everyone!!!<p>I recently launched an open-source library on github (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nebuly-ai&#x2F;nebullvm). It&#x27;s growing super fast (700+ stars), but I can&#x27;t get much feedback from github, and I&#x27;d like to ask for some feedback here.<p>Nebullvm is open-source library takes your AI model as input and outputs an optimized version that runs 5-20 times faster on your machine. Nebullvm tests multiple deep learning compilers to identify the best possible way to execute your model on your specific hardware, without impacting the accuracy of your model.<p>The goal of nebullvm is to let any developer benefit from deep learning (DL) compilers without having to spend tons of hours understanding, installing, testing and debugging this powerful technology.<p>You can find more info https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nebuly-ai&#x2F;nebullvm. And please let me know what you think of the project and if you find any ways to improve it! Big thanks :)",
