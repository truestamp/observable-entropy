I think the effects of big distribution model changes (e.g. VHS &amp; DVDs at rental places, then redbox, then just streaming) have shifted the business model of the industry, but have there been other more niche things that shape what gets produced? For instance, are there fewer movies that feature plane crashes because they won&#x27;t get picked up by airlines to be shown on their planes?",

For whatever reason, we seem to have tripped some kind of VC attention radar and I now get 2-3 emails a day from VC analysts trying to speak with me. I generally politely decline and say I&#x27;m not raising now (truth is, I&#x27;d rather be profitable than raise VC anyway).<p>What should I be doing with all these emails? Is it worth replying to these folks? Are analysts even going to be in a position to help me if I did want to raise?<p>Thanks for any advice!",
