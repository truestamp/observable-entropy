      "text": "Hi HN,<p>We have a small site we&#x27;re hosting on Linode. It&#x27;s a single app box, and a single db box. Thanks to datadog I noticed some occasional (random) slow requests. Digging into it revealed it was slow responses from the (MySQL) database eventually working out that it correlated <i>exactly</i> with disk latency spikes.<p>I then ran `iostat` in a loop to catch the slowdowns when it happened, and I can see `w_await` times of up to 2seconds at times!!.  After contacting support they moved a few of our noisiest neighbours away which has reduced the issue a lot.<p>My question is: Is this just <i>normal</i> in cloud&#x2F;shared infrastructure? Would moving to AWS (or similar) help <i>at all</i>? Maybe I should just forget about a handful (10-30) slow requests per week which are impacted by this (we have maybe 800K requests served by the app server a week, so it&#x27;s a tiny percentage). I just find it annoying that for some people they get 5-10second requests when it ought to be 200-300ms.<p>Any insights most welcome!",
