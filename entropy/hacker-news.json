      "text": "Hi HN! Throwaway account for obvious reasons.<p>2 years ago, I joined a startup as a Data Scientist as employee ~10. My base salary was in the mid-100s and I negotiated ~0.25% equity stake of a company valued at ~$10M at the seed stage. (Should have negotiated much more, but hindsight is 20&#x2F;20.)<p>Fast forward to today – the company is valued at $500M+ post-Series B, and my equity stake has been diluted to ~0.06%. Turns out that multiple convertible notes hit when the company raised a Series A and I was severely diluted. Employees who joined ~1 year after I did at the same level received 2-4x as many options, albeit with a much higher strike price.<p>I believe that this company will 10-20x and IPO within the next 4 years. But I also know that is far from a certainty.<p>1. Does it make sense to try to re-negotiate my equity comp, or should I just get a new job?<p>2. How should I go about having this conversation with the founders?",
