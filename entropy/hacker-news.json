      "text": "Screenr blocks job spam and hides your email address. It’s perfect for everywhere you used to list your email, like “Who Wants To Be Hired?” You can also add your own custom questions that you want companies to answer upfront. Too often companies avoid giving concrete answers about job offerings or double back on vague promises later. Screenr eliminates this ambiguity — if you want to know what the minimum and maximum salary range is, just add it as a custom question to your Screenr. You can use Screenr on resumes, Hacker News profiles, or anywhere you would otherwise share your email. If you want to add a brief bio and your full name you can do that too. You can use Screenr to fight back against vague LinkedIn messages, or even use it as a first response to cold emails.<p>Try out the product here:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.screenr.app&#x2F;<p>Here’s a sample Screenr profile:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.screenr.app&#x2F;?id=mkcMfL<p>Please try out the product and let me know if there’s anything you’d like added. You don’t even need an account to use the product and making your own Screenr takes less than 60 seconds. Responses to your Screenr’s will get emailed directly to you (small note, I am working on getting SES sending out of sandbox but Amazon is being slow so responses are getting forwarded from a previously production approved email blocktimize.io from a previous side project), I’ll move it over to info@screenr.app once that’s approved but the sending email really doesn’t matter.",

      "text": "My wife and I have some intimate photos. They&#x27;re actually pretty tame, but nothing we&#x27;d want anyone else to see. I&#x27;d rather not store them on any cloud service, anything online has the potential to be public.<p>I tried using a USB flash drive that encrypts itself when unmounted. It has a physical keypad to unencrypt. However when using with an iPhone the photos become corrupt as there is no &quot;unmount&quot; method on the iPhone.<p>Any other ideas?",
