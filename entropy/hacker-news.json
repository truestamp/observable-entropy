      "text": "Fellow Hackers,<p>did you also notice how broken some Google products are on the mobile Apple ecosystem, especially those related to Google Maps?<p>Examples:<p>- For quite some time Google Business Reviews are unusable on mobile Safari (tested on most recent versions), scrolling down the reviews doesn’t work, logging in to write a review is broken&#x2F;redirects to the same login page.<p>- Navigation seems pretty subpar and buggy compared to the Android edition on the same routes. Functions like music navigation while driving are unusable due to often crashing.<p>Is this managed on purpose?",
