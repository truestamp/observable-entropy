      "text": "Hi all!\nAs a disclaimer, this is a theoretical exercise which I want to understand more for myself so that I can negotiate better in the future.<p>I&#x27;m looking at how companies should answer the question: &quot;Should we give this employee the raise they are asking for right now or risk losing them in the near future?&quot;.<p>To do this, I want to know what it means when an employee is &#x27;valuable&#x27; to their employer. In a nutshell, if an employee&#x27;s value outweighs their new proposed salary, then it seems to me that they should be retained for their requested salary rather than risk losing them to another employer who will pay that and perhaps more.<p>Now the question is: &quot;How do I judge how valuable an employee is to their employer?&quot; I see a couple of variables to start off:<p>MARKET VALUE\nWhat is the employee worth to another employer? This can be judged fairly easily with some quick googling and job posts.<p>SKILL SET\nHow many people with the same skill set exist that could replace this person? Similar question to market value.<p>HISTORY\nWith the historical and legacy knowledge this person holds, how long and how difficult would it be to get someone with the same knowledge?<p>Do you have any other ideas on how to judge whether the employer should agree to an increase in their salary? Or in other words, how can I show my employer that I am worth the increase in salary I propose?",
