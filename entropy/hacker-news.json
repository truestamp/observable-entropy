I plan days in advance like others, but as I live each day, I make sure all the calendar records &quot;in the past&quot; are accurate.<p>People around me don&#x27;t seem to do this. I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m alone in the universe, or if my habit is a niche one that I cannot find similarities offline in my life, but can on developer communities like HN.",
