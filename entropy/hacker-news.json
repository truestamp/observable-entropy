      "text": "I need improve programming skills in multiple languages(4 of them), in the past I focused on one language for 1~2 weeks then switch, however by the time I return I forgot many nice details already.<p>Then I tried to spend 1 hour on each daily, that context switch seems not working very well either.<p>What&#x27;s the best approach to master them together? In the project I work on I need use them whenever a feature&#x2F;bug that needs attention.<p>Each language has its own ecosystem&#x2F;modules&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;communities and is quiet demanding alone. I don&#x27;t want to get burned out, meanwhile the product does require me to be competent on them all.",
