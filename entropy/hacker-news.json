      "text": "I wonder if there is a way we can build a token staking mechanism around how people review a product (or almost anything online). Right now, it&#x27;s kind of weird that you almost get nothing as an incentive for reviewing a product which means you cannot efficiently weigh one person&#x27;s review from another. A token incentive system that keeps building your reputation over time can lead to a much better review system:<p>1. You receive tokens when you do an activity which helps people in some way (more people buy the same product, people find your review helpful etc)<p>2. Over time, you collect tokens which act as your reputation and also unlocks other privileges (e.g you are the first to review new products, you can validate other reviews etc)<p>3. If someone leaves a bad review (identified by inactivity on the product, a group of people reporting it, or a pro reviewer validating it); you lose your tokens and as such your reputation.<p>4. Over time, the tokens you have could actually translate to actual rewards which could be a share of revenue from the platform, new product promotions etc.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts on what could work&#x2F;not work in a system like this.",
