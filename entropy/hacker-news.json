      "text": "I&#x27;m looking to start a blog, because I have a lot of stuff I&#x27;d like to write up both from a work point of view and privately. It&#x27;ll be very technical content mostly.<p>So, I&#x27;ve been looking for a platform. I really like Medium as a platform, but I hate their monetisaton by tracking. I don&#x27;t want to &#x27;sell out&#x27; my readers. Also, I don&#x27;t need it to make money for me. If anything I&#x27;d pay to publish it. But it would be nice if I could use it to get my name out there more on the topics I write about. I want to write from a purely technical point of view, I don&#x27;t want to do any placement even for products from my employer.<p>However I&#x27;d like to get some kind of attention to it. I could of course publish it on a self-hosted wordpress or something but it means there&#x27;s hardly any point because nobody would ever see it. Ideally I&#x27;d like to be on a public platform where likeminded souls could come across it by chance. I don&#x27;t want to actively promote it here (I know that&#x27;s not even allowed anyway!) or anywhere, but it would be nice if people that are interested could at least have a chance to come across it.<p>In other words, I&#x27;m looking for the &quot;Hacker News&quot; of blogging sites :)<p>Any ideas? Of course I&#x27;ve been looking but the mainstream ones are all collecting data. I came across https:&#x2F;&#x2F;habr.com which kinda resonated with me: very technical content, not much marketing placement. But it&#x27;s very Russian focused. Digging into stuff about the site (like pricing and privacy: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;habrastorage.org&#x2F;storage&#x2F;stuff&#x2F;habr&#x2F;service_price.pdf ) turns up documents that are in Russian only.<p>So I was wondering if you&#x27;d have any other ideas. I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback!",
