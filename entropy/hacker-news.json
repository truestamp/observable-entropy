      "text": "PC - politically correct. Like I never see an Indian engineer Twitter account with he&#x2F;him, she&#x2F;her, they&#x2F;them, xe&#x2F;xem -- on the rare occasions I&#x27;ve seen that it&#x27;s associated with an indication that they&#x27;re either: in &quot;Bay Area&quot;; or work at a FAANMG<p>Are they more resistant to brainwashing? Less woke and aware? Just don&#x27;t care and see it as a neurotic mostly-North American obsession? Aren&#x27;t into virtue signaling? Get a &#x27;pass&#x27; because they&#x27;re belonging to a &#x27;protected minority&#x27; (inside a white country)? Because their parents would be critical so they don&#x27;t? I do not understand why gender-divisive warfare has not taken off in India... or among the diaspora....and why has the progressive left not made it their next recruitment target? Or is it just not yet? Or is there something in the Indian culture, or psyche or &#x27;national identity&#x27; that resists these sort of ideas? Would they interpret it as a sort of &#x27;dressed up as progressive but colonial none-the-less&#x27; imposition?",

      "text": "For my startup, I have a project which has TypeScript server and client app. Workflow is much better while using mono repo with npm workspaces. Right now I am the only developer, thats fine. I am paranoid about the situation when I have multiple developer working on this project. With monorepo developers will have access to all code. Isn&#x27;t it risky when one of developer go rouge and use the code to deploy it in his own server and market it? Isn&#x27;t it especially risky for startup which less legal resource.<p>Sometime, I feel it is good approach to have server and client in different repo and have 2 different team dealing with it and have common code in git submodules. With this approach at least 2 developer have to go rouge, which is less probable.<p>What do you thing about this situation. Am I overthinking about situation? Is this the common problem, if so how organisations deal with it?",
