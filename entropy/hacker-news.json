      "text": "Hi everyone,I hope this is an ok place to rant because I&#x27;m so tired - mentally and physically.<p>I found a job in the marketing area and it is draining. Not the job as much as the people I work with. I&#x27;m very new to the field, but asking questions is bad. I&#x27;m good at my job (the results show) but the people around me are rude, hostile, and downright condescending when I ask questions. Even HR is rude, so there&#x27;s really no one to talk to. The turnover rate is high as well. It&#x27;s exhausting to deal with this day in day out and feel anxious and dreaded to go into work. That said, I can&#x27;t quit for now - I need the money and I&#x27;m not hearing back from anyone else. Are there people out there who can go into work and just go home without having to deal with all this BS? I&#x27;m also seeing a therapist because my self-esteem is at an all-time-low. It&#x27;s slow but for now I just feel like running away from all of this.<p>PS I know it&#x27;s pointless to rant but I just feel so stuck and hopeless.",
