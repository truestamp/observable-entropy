Create MS account with an existing email: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signup.live.com&#x2F;signup\n2. Open https:&#x2F;&#x2F;outlook.com\n3. Click account (top right corner) &gt;  outlook_*</i>@outlook.com\na) if you click “My Microsoft account”, it’s going to show a message “That Microsoft account doesn&#x27;t exist. Enter a different account or get a new one.”\nb) if you try to send an email to “outlook_**@outlook.com”, it’s going to bounce.<p>I have a suspicion, it’s not supposed to work like that, can any MS people verify it?",
