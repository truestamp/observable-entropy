      "text": "There are times when I’m looking for similar content to Hacker News, but in print form, for a couple of reasons.<p>* Print is easier on my eyes than an LCD after a day at work looking at a screen.<p>* There are advantages to having human-curated and edited stories; an editor sifts through the clickbait and fluff.<p>* A print periodical is inherently finite. At some point you say “I’ve finished this week’s issue” whereas HN will suck as much time as you give it.<p>However, from what I’ve seen of tech magazines or newsletters, they tend to fall into the trap of making news out of the business side of tech. While news about large tech acquisitions does make it to HN, there’s also a lot of stuff that doesn’t have business or economic impact, for example, blog posts about Haskell.<p>Not to mention I think it would be cool. I’m young enough that reading a newspaper is abnormal and interesting in of itself, and so I’d be interested in paying for that level of impracticality.",
