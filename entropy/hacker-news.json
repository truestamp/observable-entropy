So at the moment I don&#x27;t need to file a 83B election right?<p>However later on, if I bring on a Co-founder who&#x27;s equity will be subject to vesting. When that Co-founder comes on then they will have to file an 83B election?<p>Can someone please explain this in detail for me, for my situation? It would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks in advance !",
