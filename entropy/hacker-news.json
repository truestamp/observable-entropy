      "text": "I&#x27;m running a startup that&#x27;s pretty active on Twitter and LinkedIn. We&#x27;ve got Instagram and Facebook accounts to hold onto the name, but our target audience don&#x27;t seem hugely active on there, so we rarely post there.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about what to do with the IG and FB accounts recently, and I&#x27;m not too sure. It feels wrong to hold onto the names just because we might one day use them, but it also seems to make sense from a brand perspective.<p>My question, I suppose, is what do you think is best practice on this front and why?",
