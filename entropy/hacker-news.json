(Actual cost paid in performance, of course.)<p>My application could also be served well by using a database format because the information users want to know might be open-ended and possibly supplied with good SQL queries.<p>The SQLite authors claim [1] that SQlite is great for an application file format, but claims are weak. Does anyone have any experience that supports or refutes that claim?<p>Also, I would prefer a database with static typing, but I am willing to reconsider if SQLite&#x27;s manifest typing [2] is not a problem for performance, as it seems it might be. Is it a problem?<p>If I do use SQLite, is there anything else I should know?<p>(And to head off questions, my application is a specialized Version Control System.)<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;appfileformat.html<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;different.html#typing",
