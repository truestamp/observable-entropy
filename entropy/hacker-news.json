      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m a fresh graduate with a BSc in Comp sci, and I am wondering how reasonable the project I&#x27;m considering taking on as a commission is. I&#x27;m a relatively experienced programmer, but newish to web development.<p>The project is a simple ecommerce site:<p>-A couple of static pages<p>-A product listing, and the ability to add to a cart with various custom options&#x2F;dropdowns<p>-Ability to edit cart<p>-Ability to place order for delivery or pickup<p>-Process payment using stripe.<p>No shipping, no need to worry about stock, as it is a food establishment. It seems pretty doable to me but Im worried about wasting the client&#x27;s time, so I would like some input on how reasonable this would be for me to build in Django and React.<p>I don&#x27;t need perfection, both I and the client will be satisfied with something that loads fast, looks nice, and doesn&#x27;t lose orders. Though I have also found it difficult to research common pitfalls building such a site, as all I get are results related to the marketing side of ecommerce. Thoughts?",
