      "text": "I am 28 and have been suffering enough to know for sure that I am ADHD. I am a bit sceptic with going to a psych and getting a diagnosis. Mostly because of side-effects of the medicine. I developed a lot of hacks to stay on task and complete them such as coffee, pomodoro, google calender, white noise music etc.<p>But recently, it has been overwhelming for me to focus, and since last months, it seems I have no at all. Everything seems fking hard. Even the little ones. Also, I have rejection sensitive dysphoria and some off-handed comment replays in my brain like a blockbuster movie in theatre.<p>I am thinking about going to psych next week and get a proper evaluation and if possible meds.<p>How has been your life after meds or diagnosis?",
