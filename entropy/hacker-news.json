So far I have managed to get to know if a monitor is connected to the HDMI, but in no way I can now if it has been switched off or has lost power. Also I have no way to know if someone has just pressed the off button. It is just that xset and xrandr (the option talked in numerous SO posts) doesn&#x27;t get that information.<p>Is there any way?",
