I can&#x27;t turn it on</i><p><pre><code>    (people that never touched the monitor physical buttons)\n</code></pre>\n...and Twitter DMs on:<p><i>my license no longer works, why did you disable it?</i><p><pre><code>    (people that don&#x27;t see the huge red text that appears on an upgrade released outside their free-update period of the license and want free updates forever)\n</code></pre>\nFAQ&#x27;s don&#x27;t work, the license model is explained in detail for nothing because no one has time to read that, and I&#x27;m sure the most debated comments on this will be attacks on the <i>confusing</i> license model I chose because <i>why can&#x27;t I do what Parallels or Bartender does?</i><p>I&#x27;m not converting Lunar to a subscription model.<p>But I&#x27;ll seriously reconsider doing something like this for the next app. There&#x27;s only so many hours in a day, and I got tired of wasting it on answering emails.",
