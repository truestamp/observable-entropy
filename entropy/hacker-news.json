What is the grand master plan? Why Germany hasn&#x27;t built the LNG terminal? Even if you bet on the best case scenario, you need to have a backup. Energy is too important.<p>One theory I heard is that France, Germany, Russia, China wanted to build a big euroasian trading block without USA. Starting the war may kill this project.",

      "text": "I&#x27;m planning on making an open-source library to implement user-generated content on web3. Basically, if you want your users to be able to post something, you also need some way to log them in, and you need to make rules, and moderate it... And if it gets spammed, you need to deal with that. It&#x27;s a lot if you just want users to be able to comment on your blog, or share something they made with your app, or submit plugins&#x2F;themes, or leave reviews or something like that. And it&#x27;s even harder on web3, because the ecosystem is so new and the tools are hard to work with - but a lot of users.<p>Thoughts? Would it be useful to you or your company? Are there different things that I should focus on? Would you pay for it?",
