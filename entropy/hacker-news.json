      "text": "I hope this constitutes a worthy Ask HN topic.<p>As a family side project I&#x27;m trying to recreate my families&#x27; (maternal and paternal) trees into one big giant picture.<p>Currently I&#x27;m drawing a diagram in draw.io&#x2F;diagrams.net, but it gets messy, it requires alot of manual interventions of placing nodes as they come to my attention, it&#x27;s hard to add information and possibly graphics depending on edge cases (e.g. cohabits but no children, multiple marriages&#x2F;children with different fathers...) and make it all look nice and pretty.<p>I&#x27;ve searched HN and found one or two nice applications that do seem nice, but really doesn&#x27;t seem to handle the complexity I&#x27;m trying to deal with.<p>At this point, I&#x27;m considering using some kind of graph database and just let everything order itself out nice and evenly, but I have little experience with graph databases and don&#x27;t know what my options are in terms of adding information and possibly attaching images (person photo) to various nodes and make it nice and tidy and printable.<p>As a side note I&#x27;m considering skipping the whole diagram thing and just use a well-linked mediawiki or something instead with templates for family members parents&#x2F;children&#x2F;siblings along with other info. This approach seems pretty good, but judging by the fact that I&#x27;m the only one in my family doing this and knowing wiki markup and stuff, I&#x27;d imagine this would be a daunting task as well.<p>Have anyone else done visually appealing family trees before with great complexity? I&#x27;d like to have fields&#x2F;information as DOB, DOD, given names, surname and eventual past surnames, and relationships (child of &#x2F; parent of, married to, cohabited with, one night standed with causing a child.....).<p>Roughly I&#x27;m at 110 nodes&#x2F;persons at the moment, spanning over eight or nine generations [0], and adding information, nodes and stuff in draw.io just doesn&#x27;t seem convenient or easy enough for what I one day hope to be a &#x27;finished product&#x27;, i.e. a nice and intuitive image I can print out on anything between A2-A3 page size and distribute to family members.<p>Surely someone on HN has done something like this before? What are the pitfalls (e.g. should I skip both maternal and paternal linage and concentrate on one side of the family)? Are there any obvious solutions I&#x27;m missing? Am I right to take the approach of doing a diagram for visual &#x2F; esthetic reasons, or would the use of say a mediawiki&#x2F;wiki instance outweigh the visual niceness, allowing other information (anecdotes, family members&#x27; reminiscence of dead relatives etc.) maybe make it a better choice? Or is there something else completely?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;RecRPDy.png\nNote: Unfinished image.
