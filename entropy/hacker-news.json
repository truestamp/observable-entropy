      "text": "Hi HN,<p>while building something entirely, I realized that there is a lack of tools to pick colors for websites and web apps. While there certainly is an abundance of tools for color palettes, but they mostly give you three to five bright or pastel colors. Not what you need for websites. For that, you need one or two primary colors, and then stuff like text color, background, and so on.<p>So, together with another web dev I built a small web tool that allows picking exactly the colors you need for web projects and live preview your palette on a selection of demo websites.<p>The first version of the tool is online at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colorsforwebsites.com. Free and no sign up.<p>We are already using this to for early stage projects, so I hope this provides value for you as well. Of course we are also happy about any and all feedback.<p>Cheerz :)",
