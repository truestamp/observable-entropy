Now they are intent on learning it.<p>They, of course, have very strong reasoning&#x2F;learning skills. So, sitting in the freshmen programming course has been a suboptimal use of their time. Are there online courses that quickly rise from beginner to intermediate level? Something that teaches good programming habits (solve problems on paper first, effectively use library documentation etc)?<p>Even a recommendation for a bootcamp over the summer would be great.",
