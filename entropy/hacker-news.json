And do parties.“ - Job Ad for random software developer jobs.<p>Im not quite sure how I feel about the current mindset. I don’t eat fruits and I’m not quite sure what fun is anymore. I’m one of this people which are working about 70hours a week and love working. At work time I need people to work with. Not to play with. I’m also not confident how this social experiment is working out. Are people really better at work when we are do parties we can’t decline because of the pressure from the group? Even without. I’m pretty sure working together would be better for a good teamwork. But now they all want to be friends.<p>Im Self employed and I was employed.<p>Am I just anti Social?",
