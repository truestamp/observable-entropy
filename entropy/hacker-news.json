      "text": "Over the past few weeks I&#x27;ve been in five separate instances where I needed a company to help me something, and I could not reach a human.  Instead, I had to open tickets that went nowhere, reply to tickets via email, be told conflicting things by different people via email...  It&#x27;s so frustrating, and I&#x27;m sure there are others who experience this.<p>Part of me thinks (perhaps naively) if I had the ability to speak with a real person over the phone, we could sort this out instead of constant emails or creating tickets that go into a black hole.  As more companies outsource, automate, or severely cut their customer service department, there needs to be some kind of pressure to stop these frustrating experiences from happening.  Voting with our dollars doesn&#x27;t work when these companies are so integrated with our lives.",
