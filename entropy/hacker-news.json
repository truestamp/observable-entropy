      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for people trying my prototype website.<p>What I am trying to solve is that when we go throghhiking &#x2F; multiday hiking, we will carry a lot of stuff in backpack(around 12kg ~15kg). If not pack properly, the backpack will pull back, even worse the muscle will get hurt. Some even have hip bruise.<p>There are several problem I encounter:\n1. lots of forums have policy on banning self promotion, so you can&#x27;t just post it.\n2. even you found someone has similiar problem, ask him nicely and send him the link, he just ignore you and buy a new backpack.\n3. for SNS network like twitter &#x2F; Instgram, the search function seems broken? I found very few posts on it, which I thought should be quite common.<p>Not sure how to solve this. I can do code but this is not what I am good at. \nAnyway, its just a prototype, I can throw away and work on something else.<p>prototype: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnnycabin.xyz&#x2F;<p>BE WARNED: its a prototype, so its going to be ugly.",
