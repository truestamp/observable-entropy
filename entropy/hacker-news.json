      "text": "I&#x27;m currently running Debian on a MacBook Pro Early 2015 and am in general very happy with it, but it is beginning to show its age in terms of running multiple JavaScript heavy web apps. I&#x27;d like to get a newer MacBook, but without butterfly keyboard or touchbar. I&#x27;m curious to find out what is the newest MacBook with full Linux support. Any tips? Note I&#x27;m not looking for a non-Mac machine.",
