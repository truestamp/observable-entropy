      "text": "I&#x27;ve interviewed hundreds of candidates (SDEs, Data Engineers, Managers, etc.) over the past few years at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karat.com. I&#x27;ve most likely interviewed many of you as well.<p>What has been your biggest struggle hiring people for your team &#x2F; company? Whether you&#x27;re a hiring manager at a Big Tech firm, a small&#x2F;medium-sized startup, an early-stage startup creating your founding team, or you&#x27;re just interviewing contractors to help with a side project, I want to know!<p>Speaking for myself (and most Karat interviewers), we invest a lot of time writing notes on how the interview went. These write-ups are prone to human errors (typos, poorly capturing what the candidate said, etc.), take a long time to write and edit later, and we don&#x27;t necessarily know if they give hiring managers or committees the most relevant info for making hiring decisions.<p>What part of the interviewing funnel consumes most of your resources (time, effort, loss of engineering productivity, etc.)? In an ideal world, how would you optimize your own interviewing&#x2F;hiring process?<p>P.s. If you&#x27;ve done a Karat interview before, what do you wish we would do better that would make you choose us as your preferred interviewing platform for your job applicants?",
