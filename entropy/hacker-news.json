      "text": "Hi,<p>I live in France and the government is preparing a law to be able to cut electricity this winter, so I guess my OVH VPS in Gravelines isn&#x27;t assured to run 24&#x2F;7.<p>On it I run a small website with about 1000 visits per day. It&#x27;s not vital that it remains up at all times (it doesn&#x27;t bring money) but if I can do it for cheap I&#x27;m looking to relocate this VPS in a country where electricity won&#x27;t be a problem.<p>Anything in Europe seems as bleak as France. Not sure about the US. Even Finland that has its own nuclear power plants is preparing to ration electricity.<p>The only country that has cheap energy seems to be Russia, but I can&#x27;t get a VPS there for obvious reasons.<p>Any suggestions?",
