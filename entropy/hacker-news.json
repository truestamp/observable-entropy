      "text": "This barely ramen-profitable content project at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tenproblems.com was started in early 2020 as a pandemic lockdown effort, aka a way to keep the mind busy at a truly difficult time for we all. Now that some of us are luckily, slowly going back to business as usual, side time is becoming scarce again and it remains to be seen where to pivot this thing for 2022. Here enter you proud HNs, the lions, a tech-savvy world audience from many backgrounds and lifestyles, and that’s my question in the form of an informal survey. I basically have two simple options I can pursue in my spare time: A) just open a blog on the same home website and carry on with exploiting mostly unknown academic sources while adding comments, articles and pages for a bigger audience and SEO purposes. B) switch to software by aggregating and customising existing resources, related with any booklet in the tenproblems series, so that words can be followed by implementable actions. Of course, the level needs to stay low-but-not-too-low, say near the undergraduate entry bar of the spectrum, and implicitly aimed at dissemination and education. What would you pursue then? Thanks.",

      "text": "Our analytic number theory book club that began in March 2021 as a result of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26366464 is coming to an end today.<p>The book club blog at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbeat.cc&#x2F;blog&#x2F; provides an account of the journey so far. The best part of hosting and participating in book club meetings like this has been the extremely smart folks I got the opportunity to interact with during the meetings. I learnt so much more about the beautiful subject of analytic number theory by interacting with them than I could have if I were reading the book alone.<p>A big thank you to the Hacker News community and the folks from here who showed interest in this book club, joined our meetings, and made this book club successful. We will have our last meeting on this book today. Everyone is very welcome to join it today even if only to lurk! See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbeat.cc&#x2F;blog&#x2F;analytic-number-theory-book-club-ending-today.html for more details.",
