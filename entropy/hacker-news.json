Terraform is good in general.<p>My main problem is I sometimes miss a small detail which causes a production issue. It happened 2-3 times in the past few years.<p>Is there any good tool or practical book&#x2F;blog to help me? I found a couple of Terraform generator solutions, but those are basic. \nMost blog posts I&#x27;ve checked describe the high-level concepts and don&#x27;t go into details.<p>Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.",
