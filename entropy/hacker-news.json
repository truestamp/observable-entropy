Front page of site is a list ranked by most followed feeds, time, etc.\nEach RSS item has comments, with no karma system to discourage echo chambers. Flag system with light guidelines to avoid 4chan bigotry effect, but loose enough to let users post as freely as Reddit. Every user can see each other’s feed list and obviously add to their own.<p>I’m wondering if people would find this interesting and useful",
