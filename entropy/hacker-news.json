Clearly, though, they require sufficient trust and safety.<p>If strangers are a bridge too far, would you self-organize trips like this with co-workers if planning were simple?",

      "text": "Hey all, I&#x27;d like to share something I&#x27;ve been working on for a while: HacheQL.<p>HacheQL is a developer library and NPM package that makes it possible to cache GraphQL queries and responses with the http caching mechanism built into browsers and the proxy infrastructure of the web.<p>It&#x27;s open source, compatible with whatever graphql infrastructure you&#x27;ve already implemented, and is scalable and performant.<p>To set it up, just import and use our middleware along the GraphQL route in your server&#x27;s code. Then wrap any http requests you wish to cache in the provided client function. If you have an extensive codebase, you don&#x27;t need to transition all at once - using just the middleware won&#x27;t give any caching benefits, but it won&#x27;t alter your application&#x27;s behavior.<p>You can see our source, and detailed documentation, here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oslabs-beta&#x2F;hacheQL , and we are on npm here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;hacheql.",
