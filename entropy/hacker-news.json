      "text": "I am neither a combat veteran, nor a military history buff, nor a wargamer. In trying to follow the news, I feel a lack of understanding of fundamentals of infantry warfare.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the US Army publishes an amazing detailed manual, “Infantry Platoon and Squad Manual” ATP 3-21.8, that they (!) make freely available for download. It&#x27;s more of a how-to handbook, or a set of instructions - not exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>There are many books on military history available, with titles like WWII &#x2F; Vietnam &#x2F;Civil War &#x2F; Ancient Roman &#x2F; Infantry Tactics, but they seem to be a lot of history and cataloguing of events and weapons, without as much big-picture philosophy.<p>It seems there should be a textbook that covers fundamentals that apply largely across time, with an explanatory philosopy that covers general principles, but I haven&#x27;t found it yet. (Maybe something like &quot;Infantry Tactics for Physicists,&quot; that begins with the line, &quot;Assume a spherical soldier.&quot;)<p>Any recommendations?",
