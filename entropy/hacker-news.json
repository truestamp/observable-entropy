I didn&#x27;t know behind all these cookie banners there were many companies making profit.<p>Still, it&#x27;s not clear to me where does this profit come from.<p>With many browsers already forbidding third-party cookies, many people using only essential cookies, many others removing cookies with extensions such as Cookie Autodelete... where do these companies get profit from?<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curiuous as I was offered a position in one of these companies, but to me... it looks like it&#x27;s a business which is rapidily dying.",

The letter was sent to one of my personal email address as well as Barinsta&#x27;s public inbox (and as a result, it is published). \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;austinhuang0131&#x2F;austinhuang0131&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2<p>In response, the source code has been taken down, and all promotional materials within my control has been adjusted to reflect the fact.<p>While I believe it is nearly impossible to fight a resourceful multinational firm and reinstate the app, we will still try to get as much resources as we could to navigate in this crisis.<p>At this dire moment, I ask you to do 1 thing: Please let others know what is happening here. Such bullying behaviour against a young university student is in no way excusable. Such bullying behaviour against many internet users is in no way excusable.<p>It has been an honour of a lifetime to serve as one of the main contributors of Barinsta. I am forever grateful for the countless supporters along the way.",
