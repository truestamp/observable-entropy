Of course, I’m talking neither small team superstars nor big labs and consortia. And then, here he came: one guy asked me for advice while preparing to submit a paper in my primary field to a well-respected journal. Nothing transcendental, still… this guy has being putting out one hundred and twenty accepted contributions in the last five years, in a number of diverse fields, and some with a seemingly legit number of citations. My question to you HNers comes as follows: is this a new scam? Is this a new job, sort of paper factories? Are these results legit or artificial? I know counterfeiting is all over the publishing industry, these days. I am going to decline his advice request, yet could we discuss what’s happening there, if anything? Thanks and happy 2022 all!",
