I know there&#x27;s already a way to do this with &lt; 2011 iMacs.<p>Things I&#x27;ve already tried, but the experience is not great:\n- used NoMachine and dummy HDMI\n- Installed Monterey on the 2012 iMac and use it as an airplay receiver\n- used tools like [Deskreen](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pavlobu&#x2F;deskreen)",
