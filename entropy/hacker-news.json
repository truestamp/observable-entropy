      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>I&#x27;ve been in tech world for 10+ years, most of them mobile. I am based in Asia, but for the last 3 years been working remotely. Clients mostly from USA, Europe, thus I have no problem with the time-zone. Charging 85usd&#x2F;h as of now.<p>I do specialise in building e2e products in Flutter (mobile framework). With it I can get a new contract pretty easily (due to my extensive portfolio and references). However, I&#x27;m thinking to make a move and check more of blockchain&#x2F;crypto development space. Am open for pretty much anything - as long as it involves blockchain and I can learn from people&#x2F;resource around me.<p>I seem to find quite some troubles finding leads for such jobs. Maybe am looking into some wrong places?<p>Tried:\n- LinkedIn\n- UpWork\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crypto.jobs&#x2F;\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptojobslist.com&#x2F;\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptocurrencyjobs.co&#x2F;\n- Twitter (blokchain&#x2F;crypto, flutter tags)<p>LinkedIn seemed to have most offers, but it&#x27;s fairly hard to filter. However, trying to go through them. \nUpWork seems not to have great quality job posts, although found couple great ones.<p>Any advice is appreciated!",

      "text": "Hi HN,\nI&#x27;m looking for a way to find any usage of a specific DB model in a monolith - I would prefer to have a tool that scans the files and input&#x2F;outputs the following:<p>Input:<p>- <i>files to scan</i> I.E [&quot;.&#x2F;src&quot;, &quot;.&#x2F;test&quot;, ...]<p>- <i>what to scan for</i> I.E [&quot;ExampleModel.&quot;, &quot;models.ExampleModel.&quot;, ...]<p>- <i>exclude from scan</i> I.E [&quot;.&#x2F;src&#x2F;example-folder&quot;, ...]<p>Results:<p>- From folder: &quot;.&#x2F;src&quot;:<p><pre><code>        - Number of occurrences: *number*\n\n        - Occurrences: string[] of file paths\n</code></pre>\n- From folder: &quot;.&#x2F;test&quot;:<p><pre><code>        - Number of occurrences: *number*\n\n        - Occurrences: string[] of file paths\n</code></pre>\nThis needs to be something I can write in Javascript or Python.
