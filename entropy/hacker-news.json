      "text": "They recently started trying to get me to give them information from a second credit card before I can complete a purchase and they will not let me purchase otherwise. This is annoying and so I just switched to Grubhub. I am trying to understand why DoorDash did this. I guess it&#x27;s supposed to have something to do with security, but I have a hunch that they are losing many customers because of this. Many people simply do not have a second credit card. I do, but I do not want to bother to dig it out just to make DoorDash happy. Aren&#x27;t they losing a bunch of money by doing this?",
