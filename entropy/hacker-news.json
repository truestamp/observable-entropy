I am personally upset by the further invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces.  I am trying to think of what ways I should respond to it.  I am genuinely seeking advice.  My current thoughts are to:\n1) Modify applications to have a political statement, like &quot;Ukraine is not Russia&quot; or &quot;No war please&quot; in Russian for Russian users.\n2) Give financial aid to the Ukrainian defenders.\n3) Pull my apps from Russia. (I like this the least)\nI have a small audience and limited resources, but I am determined to do something.  What are your thoughts about how I should go about this?",
