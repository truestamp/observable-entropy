Do you feel there is an outlet for you to do that? Do you wish to share knowledge, but you find current platforms lacking?<p>e.g. I&#x27;m interested in graphics&#x2F;audio programming (on linux). I&#x27;d be happy to pay for some guidance&#x2F;instructions&#x2F;course, but not sure where to find people that would be interested in teaching&#x2F;guiding me.
