      "text": "Like many orgs, we try to keep on top of tagging important user actions with our analytics tool of choice.<p>However, we&#x27;re trying to be more mature in how we document our Product Analytics so that we have a history of changing analytics event names, event properties, weaved in with product history of changes. This could include documenting this like the fact we renamed a CTA, combined two CTAs into one, or changed the functionality for a modal.<p>The goal is to allow a new team member to dive into analytics without getting lost or having to ask multiple other team members &quot;what does X event mean?&quot; or &quot;Are we really missing Y event between X and Z dates?&quot;<p>I imagine this has to be a problem others have run into, and hopefully solved. I&#x27;m curious to hear your solutions. If you have a template you&#x27;ve used to track this, please share. If there is a paid product out there that does this, let me know!<p>Thanks HN.",
