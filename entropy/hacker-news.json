      "text": "I have this one client that insists on using flutter for their landing page. This is from the fear of not understanding React by their own dev team, as I recommended Nextjs for performance and SEO. I told them that the middleground to this problem is just plain HTML and CSS, but they&#x27;re keep insisting on using Flutter. Flutter&#x27;s website (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.dev) don&#x27;t even use flutter for their website, it&#x27;s ridiculous. I wrote this list of reasons not using Flutter for their landing page:<p>1. Bad performance\n2. Bad SEO\n3. Limited libraries for extended features like animations, etc\n4. no other upside compared to other frontend js frameworks, besides they already have the flutter dev team<p>What are the things that I can propose to convince them? Thanks",
