      "text": "In a time when the in-group is increasingly self-defined, as geography becomes decoupled from allegiance, does the nation state seem like an anachronism?<p>As a thought experiment, what would the world look like if we had:<p>- opt-out citizenship based on birth location<p>- opt-in subscription citizenship decoupled from geography<p>- voluntary and public tax payments (subscription fees)<p>The idea is to &quot;put your money where your mouth is,&quot; taken to the extreme – even the playing field with opt-out citizenship, create equity by decoupling it from geography, and provide accountability by transacting in public. To me, this seems like it solves some people&#x27;s alleged grievances, but creates new problems. It also raises other questions, like switching costs – can you move between governments as frequently as you&#x27;d like?<p>Ignoring the fact that this is totally implausible for a number of reasons – mostly due to violence – I&#x27;ve been finding it a fun idea to think about recently.<p>Would you want to live in this world? Will we inevitably converge on something approaching it?",
