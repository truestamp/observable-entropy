I need to discern between very similar sounds that are all around the same frequency range (40hz-250hz).<p>Currently I&#x27;m using a pair of wired Apple earphones and to record the sounds, and visually inspecting a waterfall spectrogram to find differences.<p>Perhaps obviously, I&#x27;m not having much luck visually analysing it. I don&#x27;t want learn the ins and outs of machine learning and signal analysis only to find that there isn&#x27;t enough variability in the sounds.<p>Is there any simple way I can determine if these sounds can be meaningfully categorised?",
