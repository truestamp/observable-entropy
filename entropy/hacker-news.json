      "text": "Hi all.\nMy website is running a verify email to query smtp server the perform these command<p>Note : the mail from {myemail}@mydomain is not real and my server dont have spf and dkim yet<p>HELO mydomain<p>MAIL FROM: &lt;mymail@mydomain&gt;<p>RCPT TO: &lt;examplemail@aol.com&gt;<p>QUIT<p>After running these command i get black list on eXploits Blocklist (XBL) &amp; CSS Blocklist (CSS).\nI check issue from spamhaus and this is the detail infomation :<p>(IP, UTC timestamp, HELO value)<p>{hide my ip :O} outlook.com<p>Notable things about the HELOs:<p>They are often dynamic-looking rDNS, and claim to be from geographically very different networks\nThey can include impossible HELOs like &quot;gmail.com&quot;, &quot;outlook.com&quot;, &quot;comcast.net&quot; - Gmail, Outlook and Comcast do not use these. These are all fake.\nThe cause of this problem is frequently found to be coming from an phone or laptop with &quot;free&quot; VPN or channel unlocker, &quot;free&quot; streaming apps.\nThis can be caused by a spambot infection or a server misconfiguration.<p>First check that the HELO settings are correct. This can be done by sending an email from {hide my ip :O} to &quot;helocheck@abuseat.org&quot;. A bounce that contains the required information will be returned immediately. It will look like an error. It is not. Please examine the information in the body of the email. NOTE: &quot;helocheck@abuseat.org&quot; does not currently work with IPv6.<p>If the HELO settings are correct, then there is a spambot or some other kind of malware!<p>What step i need to take in order to not get blacklist like this in the future. Thanks in advanced!",
