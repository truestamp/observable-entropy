      "text": "I share personal details below if you want to help me in particular, but general advice is of course very welcome. I imagine many of us are looking to do something at least a little different.<p>--------------<p>My resume doesn&#x27;t scream competency with any particular technologies. I&#x27;ve just been &quot;the web guy&quot; for marketing teams. I enjoy being a generalist but it seems to be backfiring on me now. I probably couldn&#x27;t swing it in a front-end role or a back-end role. I&#x27;ve gotten by, by writing mostly HTML and CSS with some snippets of PHP and Bash. Roles tend to be looking for a React specialist or a Laravel expert. When years of experience with a technology come up, the best I can usually say is: &quot;I used that for a thing once.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m contemplating taking a break from tech altogether and doing--something with plants? Recently, it occurred to me that technical writing is a possibility. I might be able to stay proximate to my old roles but still do something different for a while. Honestly, getting into an &quot;actual&quot; developer role feels as daunting today as it did when I had no work experience. Is this just a confidence thing? I&#x27;ve enjoyed playing with computers since I was a child, but still the idea that I could even be a developer feels like a delusion. As a kid, I wanted cobble together a website, not become a PHP dev, so I learned enough to make my toy projects. Now, I&#x27;m 26 and after some professional experience, I feel semi-capable at a lot of things, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what most roles are looking for and I can&#x27;t blame them.",
