All accounts will be closed, and all files will be removed from the EVBackup servers at that time. We’re sorry for the hassle this causes in finding a replacement service.&quot;</i><p>And, interestingly:<p><i>&quot;As you look for alternative services, consider rsync.net.&quot;</i><p>Here is the full announcement:<p>ExaVault, the provider of the EVBackup service, recently joined forces with Files.com to create the world’s largest company focused exclusively on cloud native SaaS Managed File Transfer.  You can find more details about the acquisition on our blog post as well as over on the Files.com blog.<p>As part of this transition, we made the decision to shut down the EVBackup service. We’ve been proud to offer this self-service backup option, but it no longer fits into our portfolio of service offerings.<p>The EVBackup service will shut down on July 31, 2022. All accounts will be closed, and all files will be removed from the EVBackup servers at that time. We’re sorry for the hassle this causes in finding a replacement service.<p>We have turned off all invoice renewals, and you will not receive any additional charges from us during this transition period.<p>As you look for alternative services, consider rsync.net. They offer a similar service at an affordable price.<p>If you currently use FTP or SFTP as the transfer protocol for moving files to EVBackup, you can try out our full-featured Files.com service. Files.com is a great choice if you have high transfer volume, a need for automated workflows, or are interested in automated syncing capabilities. If you are interested in this option, email us and we’ll connect you with an account executive to discuss your options.<p>It has been a pleasure to serve you over the years. If you have additional questions, please reply back by email or contact us by phone at 1-510-500-0245 x2.<p>Sincerely,<p>The ExaVault Team",
