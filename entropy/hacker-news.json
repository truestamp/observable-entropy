The goal of the focus group discussion is to gain insights about the Linux Operating System market and how its customers think about paid support from Linux Providers.<p>This is a paid 2-hr focus group discussion for $350. I found you on LinkedIn and I think your profile is a good fit for this project. This is a research study and not a sales solicitation.  Please note we are only interested in your point of view and are not seeking confidential information.<p>---------------------------<p>Anyone else get these emails? What happens if you do one? Is it a stealth sales call as I suspect? What is the process, and who is getting what out of it?",
