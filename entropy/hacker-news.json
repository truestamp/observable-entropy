      "text": "Hi!<p>Similar to [0] and [1], but hoping this is different enough to warrant a new topic.<p>For the last 15 years, we&#x27;ve had Google Apps For Work&#x2F;G Suite&#x2F;Google Workspace for our family - and we use Gmail, Drive, Photos, and importantly have spent hundreds on Google Play Store purchases (albeit, 90% of that was using credit from Google Opinion Rewards) - we&#x27;ve all only ever had Android phones, so over ~10+ years, it starts to add up!\nWe also all use YouTube and oAuth into a good few services with our accounts too.<p>So, moving to Exchange&#x2F;O365 or another service that isn&#x27;t Google means we&#x27;d lose our Play purchases. If there was a way we could transfer them to a free account (I&#x27;ve asked them)<p>I think the only real option is to upgrade, so we keep all our non-exportable (at least, not easily) data. I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to move to a self-hosted world of Nextcloud, Mail in a Box, Bitwarden (we&#x27;re doing this anyway already) and a Photos alternative, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s possible right now, at least not with the time restriction Google&#x27;s placed on us.<p>Is there really no other option? Seems silly, but I guess it&#x27;s been free for so long anyway. Now it&#x27;s £200 a year - incredible!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29998659\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29996432",
