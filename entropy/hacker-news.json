      "text": "For the past couple years I&#x27;ve been trying to learn Android app development. I&#x27;ve been working as a &#x27;software engineer&#x27; off and on for 10 years simply out of corporate need (didn&#x27;t go to school for). I had an idea for a personal note taking app and now I&#x27;m considering the possibility of releasing it. In my search for testers, Hacker News came up many times and I thought this may be a good place to post and request some testing and evaluation. As the site rules indicate, I&#x27;m looking for honest, respectful, helpful input.<p>ABOUT THE APP<p>The app is called ResearchDB, a &quot;documenting&quot; form of note taking app - meaning it requires you to &quot;document&quot; your source and has a 1&#x2F;2 dozen required fields. In other words, the purpose of this note taking app is not just noting something of interest, but &quot;supportively documenting&quot; the note and source. This is why I call it ResearchDB. We all have particular, beliefs, ideas, interests, and this note taking app is intended to be a way to document those beliefs, interests and ideas through the creation of multiple &quot;subject-based&quot; databases containing notes in a way that helps us remember and recall those things in a way that helps us remember them. And since it is a phone app, we can recall and pull up those supportive notes at any moment with our handy smartphone.<p>THE APK TARGET COMPATABITY<p>The Minimum SDK is 28 and the target is 30\nIt requires Internet and Storage (read&#x2F;write) permissions so that you have the ability to document sources and can export or import notes and databases on topics of interests.<p>ABOUT THE LINKS<p>I have included a link to the Android APK for downloading and a YouTube link which demonstrates the intent and how to use the app in 9-10 minutes. The APK link takes you to &quot;ufile.io&quot; - a web storage source I use, but it is free to download, there is not a requirement to sign up, create an account or purchase, simply just choose the slower - free download option. The APK should be signed and I will assume a tester may know how to sideload it through developer options to their Android phone.<p>APK\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;ufile.io&#x2F;kw5gonpc<p>YouTube\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OvpgviLECXA<p>BTW, the app also includes a PDF pictorial guide on how to do everything - besides the YouTube video.<p>I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not I should include one of these links above and which would be a more appropriate choice if so. Since it says &quot;OR&quot; between the URL field and posting field here, I didn&#x27;t read that I couldn&#x27;t add them here, but let me know whether I posted these links incorrectly.<p>Thanks for this opportunity and being willing to test and try this if you do.<p>- Scott",
