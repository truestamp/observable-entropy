      "text": "I just found out that Kickstarter calls people that list projects on their platform creatives.  But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an apt word because you also call online video content creators creatives as well.  I think there is a distinction between the two.  I would consider Kickstarter creatives lean more towards the startup side than video content.  They produce physical and&#x2F;or digital goods that can be sold.<p>What word should I use to describe these people?",
