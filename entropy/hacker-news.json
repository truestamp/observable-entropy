      "text": "I was reading a verge article [1], and this stood out to me.<p>&gt; <i>But in STEM fields, directory structure remains crucially important. Astronomers, for example, may work with hundreds of thousands of files in the same format — which can be unwieldy to scale to a searchable system, Plavchan says.</i><p>Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve found searchable systems to be lukewarm. Search engines like Google are good for out-of-the-blue questions, but when looking within local files or data inside programs, search systems struggle to get what I need quickly. If I remember a specific file name, Spotlight search on macOS usually tells me what I need,  while the default search on Windows does more or less the same. But these search systems never really help me find things in-depth, perhaps some mathematical formula embedded somewhere in a PDF file compiled from LaTeX. Or these search systems are not as forgiving when I&#x27;m trying to look for something that isn&#x27;t text-based, like pictures or 3D assets.<p>Search is complex, so what can I do to depend less on these built-in systems? How can I make things more searchable in general? What methodological approach can be adopted to make searching for something, regardless of context, better?<p>Mindful folder structures, tagging files, consistent naming, and associating content to regular text as much as I can is a start, but I wonder if there&#x27;s more that I&#x27;m failing to do.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;22684730&#x2F;students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z",
