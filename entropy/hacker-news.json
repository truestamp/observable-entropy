      "text": "Good day!<p>On most days, instant coffee with milk works for me. However, I have recently started intermittent fasting (5:2), and i find the black coffee to be too bitter. While adding a bit of salt helps, I am on the lookout for coffee that is not bitter, even if that meant i have to learn how to roast&#x2F;grind, so on fasting days i can enjoy caloree-free coffee.<p>Currently I am living in Spain, and I could budget ~250EUR. Any suggestions on beans&#x2F;equipment, and also where to buy? any resources&#x2F;books (in English) to learn more on this topic?<p>Thanks much in advance!",
