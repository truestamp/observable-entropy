      "text": "If you&#x27;re moving to Germany, and you have never been there before, how can you know what salary to ask for, and what standard of living it will afford?<p>What sort of data, information or visualisations would help you make a decision?<p>I am asking this because I help people move to Germany, and compensation is an important aspect of it.<p>This would be my current approach:<p>1. Look at the minimum wage, median income, or household income distribution [0].<p>2. Use the Office of Statistics tool [1] to find average salaries for your job. It&#x27;s really good.<p>3. Put your expected salary in a tax calculator [2] to know how much you actually keep, after all contributions.<p>4. Get an idea of the cost of living in your area. Rent could be harder to measure.<p>5. Build a rough budget based on this.<p>I was thinking of combining most of this into a simplified income tax calculator: enter your salary, get a report. Drag the salary slider left and right to see what happens. Add more details about your situation to improve the accuracy.<p>How would you approach this?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwkoeln.de&#x2F;fileadmin&#x2F;user_upload&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;2019&#x2F;einkommensverteilung&#x2F;index.html<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;service.destatis.de&#x2F;DE&#x2F;gehaltsvergleich&#x2F;beruf.html<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arbeitnow.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;tools&#x2F;salary-calculator&#x2F;germany",
