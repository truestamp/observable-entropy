Aside from digital currencies, useful applications of Blockchain seem relatively niche and a significant push towards decentralisation more generally seem unlikely given the lack of economic incentives for the established players (MS, FB, Google, Apple) to allow users to own their own data and services.<p>I generally tend to be quite sceptical of tech trends though so I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;m missing here or if there&#x27;s something I should be looking into?",
