      "text": "I can&#x27;t help, but notice a correlation between how I &quot;perform&quot; on interviews and how the stock market is doing. I feel like the days stocks are down I somehow don&#x27;t do as well on interviews. Note I don&#x27;t check the stocks before the interview. Yes, I am saying could it be that the people who are doing the interviews are affected by the market and if so would it be wise to not do interviews on down days by postponing the interview or another way? After all many people in tech have a stock portfolio and many check them regularly and this could affect their mood, etc.<p>Another strategy would be to not do interviews during high stock market volatility times.",
