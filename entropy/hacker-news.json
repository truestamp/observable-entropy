      "text": "Hi there,<p>As a drone owner, I always feel uncomfortable flying over urban areas. I afraid my drone could just fall on something because of electrical issue onboard or accidental propeller damage. Do any of you feel the same?<p>I believe DJI tested everything and such thing should be a pretty rare situation. But I can&#x27;t just stop being worried about.<p>The reason is the fact that my previous Syma drone just completely stopped its props mid in the air twice, without any casualties luckuly. So I switched to DJI, but got another situation - the drone just went away with no actions from my side. That makes me unconfident about software&#x2F;hardware on the drone.<p>So having some emergency system like a parachute as a backup feels reasonable for me. So I&#x27;ll try to build my own.<p>Could it be valuable product for you?",
