Cartoonish characters used as avatars and the other elements put forward in his keynote leave people wondering what will the actual improvement be.<p>Twitter is making the transition towards a &quot;free speach&quot; platform which will now ask people to pay to play, somehow creating synergies with Tesla and SpaceX (???) given the cult of personality surrounding the new CEO.<p>Seems to me like we are really splitting hairs with regards to future improvements and innovation from those companies.",
