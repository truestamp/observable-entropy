The post also discusses on why many juniors do not have enough experience on technical side.<p>Therefore, can you suggest&#x2F;point out the ways one can be technically competent to that level degree?<p>From my experience, study alone doesn&#x27;t suffice. Because one cannot remember all the technical details from textbook or paper! And if we do not implement new things, we are unlikely to understand things completely.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30574489",
