There is proper tutorial on my TODO list. I&#x27;ve created a game for it (guess the number) that is only 31 lines of code (with empty lines), I&#x27;ve added it to [git][3].<p>You can copy paste the code into playground and play with it.<p>On my road map there is also node.js version, so you will be able to run your apps in the terminal.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcubic&#x2F;gaiman&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reference-Manual<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcubic&#x2F;gaiman&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples<p>[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcubic&#x2F;gaiman&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;guess_the_number.gs",
