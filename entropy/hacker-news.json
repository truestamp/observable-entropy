      "text": "I built this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;corpulent&#x2F;fragments as an experiment&#x2F;POC for fetching and transforming data from various sources and exposing it via a REST API for consumption in BI dashboards, apps, and so on. Jinja defines the structure a REST API should return, users can write custom functions to transform data. Data gets optionally cached after its processed the first time so consecutive API calls are instant. Jinja is optional, and users can just write Python code.<p>GraphQL is a similar idea to this.<p>I am burned out trying to figure out good use cases, a market to approach, and generally in what ways to expand on it further. So I am reaching out to the community in hopes of gaining some insights or ideas!<p>Thanks in advance.",
