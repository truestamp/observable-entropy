      "text": "Medical students spend years studying the ins and outs of disease--every symptom and its possible disease. Humans are naturally not very good at probability, so it can be easy for doctors to overly diagnose rare conditions. With machine learning getting more powerful every year and digital health devices like Apple watches becoming more mainstream, I do wonder if the need for encyclopedic knowledge will decline, and that tech will become better at preventing disease than doctors are. Maybe their role will shift to being able to analyze the insight that ML provides, and not having to diagnose disease by symptoms directly.",
