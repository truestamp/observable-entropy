I am also from a country where mental health is still a taboo subject and counselling is expensive.<p>Problem: I have some friends who are hesitant to get mental help because of lack of anonymity during the counselling process. This seems like a silly reason to not to be vulnerable with someone but it seemed genuine given the laws around doctor-patient confidentiality in my country. (they are not air tight).<p>I want to know if there are tools out there that can enable anonymized video conferencing (by use of avatars or by other methods) so that the initial friction to talk to a mental health expert are somewhat reduced.<p>I am also open to hear any other suggestions on how to convince someone to seek help when mental health is still not a well understood topic in my country. For what&#x27;s it&#x27;s worth I am from India.",
