      "text": "Windows 10, Ryzen 5 1400 PC. I had shut down Slack to avoid distractions, and then got a notification that it was time for a reboot for Windows updates. After I was done with the task at hand, I rebooted the PC. During bootup I tapped DEL to get into the UEFI settings. While I was browsing the UEFI settings, a Slack notification played through my computer speakers. I was perplexed but thought it must have been my phone. A second later, I got a notification on my phone, and that&#x27;s when I remembered that my PC and Phone Slack apps have different sounds.<p>&quot;OK, maybe somehow W10 has booted while I&#x27;m sitting here in UEFI&quot; so I exited UEFI settings, booted into W10, and... Slack isn&#x27;t running.<p>I have to admit that if it didn&#x27;t happen to me, I&#x27;d never believe a person who told me this story. But I can assure you it&#x27;s true and I&#x27;m sure of the circumstances I&#x27;ve described.<p>So how on earth did I get a slack notification from my computer <i>after</i> I had shut Slack down and was in the middle of a reboot?",

      "text": "Ask HN: &quot;Best&quot; cross-platform disk encryption software to use?<p>What software that&#x27;s cross-platform (Linux + MacOS at least) and allows encrypting mount-able volumes&#x2F;images (not necessarily full-disk encryption, more for very important documents like keys, etc), and possibly putting them in the cloud (for backup, and maybe on Dropbox) would people recommend these days?<p>VeraCrypt seems popular on the web, but searching HN for past threads about it shows (even despite previous audits) people aren&#x27;t completely convinced by it.<p>If I was Linux-only, I could likely use dm-crypt, but I would like multi-platform support for long-term confidence and convenience, and it&#x27;s not really clear what other choices I have.",
