      "text": "Here by &quot;message bus&quot; I mean this EIP pattern: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com&#x2F;MessageBus.html  . Message bus is not equal to message broker. It&#x27;s not really EDA. It&#x27;s just a way of system interaction.<p>According to my research,  Message Bus pattern kind of inspired ESB (or is highly related to). ESB has failed, because IBM guys make it a huge middleware that&#x27;s complicated and expensive.<p>But Message Bus in my opinion is still a great pattern and can still help a lot in modern microservices architecture.  Its &quot;mediator&quot; nature and &quot;common data structure&quot; can improve loose-coupling of a microservice ecosystem, and make things more understandable.<p>Sadly it seems it&#x27;s not very popular nowadays per my googling. Message-based communication in microservcies is very popular, but &quot;common data structure&quot; is not used. For most architectures there is no concept of &quot;bus&quot;, even if pub&#x2F;sub is used as the major way of messaging.<p>I can see Apache Camel is still popular.  But I found few examples of people using it for message bus.<p>This is just my impression. I&#x27;d love to hear different ideas.",
