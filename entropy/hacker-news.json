      "text": "Hi<p>My Asus AC86U gave up after 4 years and I am in the market for another router.\nI used to run the AC86U with Merlin software, so I&#x27;m not shy of tinkering, especially if I can improve my security and privacy. I sometimes work from home, but mostly watch Netflix while my kid plays online games. Now I&#x27;m back to Virgin Media Hub 3, but it&#x27;s worse in terms of range.<p>Do you have any recommendations for a replacement?",

      "text": "Oberon makes it possible for a service provider to issue capability tokens to clients in such a way that the service provider never sees the value of the capability token. This prevents the service provider from being able to impersonate the client.\nOberon relies upon zero-knowledge proof presentation of the capability token so that the token is never transmitted norrevealed. Instead of the client sending the token to the service—as is done with API tokens today—the client sends a zero-knowledge proof proving that they have a valid capability token issued by the service provider; this is called proof-of-knowledge.<p>GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cryptidtech&#x2F;oberoncryptid<p>Get cryptid: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptid.tech]",
