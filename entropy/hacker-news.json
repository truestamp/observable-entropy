      "text": "I&#x27;m building an open source activity indicators library based on reanimated 2 and wanted to know what activity indicator animations you guys would want to see in the package?<p>Package Key Benefits:\n- fluid on 120fps (thanks to reanimated v2.3.0+). (the basic react-native animated is limited to 60fps)\n- customisable using useAnimatedStyle\n- controllable from worklets, so you can start &#x2F; stop the activity indicator as a response to a gesture handler, and thus provide instant feedback<p>I look forward to your suggestions in the comments bellow",
