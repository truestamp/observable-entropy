      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m used to leaving my main browser open in private mode.  It keeps tabs open across app&#x2F;os restarts, but aggressively clears cookies in a bunch of circumstances.  It also disables annoyances like autocompleting searches from browser history (since there isn&#x27;t such a thing).<p>Is there something similar for Android?  Vandium and Firefox nuke my private tabs on app exit, which isn&#x27;t what I want.  Basically, I want a web browser that is incapable of persisting state beyond the list of open tabs (and whatever crap they think they&#x27;ve persisted).  However, since it is a daily driver, I want tabs to stay open until I close them.<p>Bonus points if each TLD gets a completely separate set of &quot;persistent state&quot;.<p>Finally, I suspect I&#x27;m asking for too much, but buttons or gestures for &quot;force reload&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; would be amazing.<p>Has anyone managed to get something similar working?",
