Facebook[1] used this to drive &quot;engagement&quot; - the more oxygen the user consumed, the more engaged they are.<p>That is, engagement was driven to the point that it became a <i>physically measurable load</i> on the user.  &quot;Engagement&quot; was literally sapping peoples&#x27; physical energy.<p>Just a dream?  Facebook&#x27;s rebrand and stated new direction seem to indicate that they&#x27;re going in this direction.  (They might not take it this far, of course.  Then again, they might.)<p>-----<p>[1] I say &quot;Facebook&quot;, even though in my dream I never saw a logo or a brand on the UI.  It looked like a FB-style feed, though.",
