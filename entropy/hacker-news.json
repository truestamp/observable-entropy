      "text": "Hi I am a 23 year old from India. I currently work as a devops guy in a company at salary of 450$ per month. I work 48 hours (6 days) per week. Due to this, my health is deteriorating. I have constant headache and have been advised to see a neuro doctor (which I am doing soon). I am about to burnout and having early signs of depression (not interested doing anything, 0 motivation, feeling angry all the time). It has been 6 months since I joined this job. Since this job is costing me my health and my youth, I want a job(or anything) that gives me 500$ per month (or 450$) for working 20 hours per week (preferably less).I am taking a week off to deal with depression and to figure out what to do next. \nHow can I do this? Any type of job that requires a laptop and an internet connection is fine.<p>Though I am in devops, I know basics of Django and interested in development (backend). \n https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;TheGardenMan<p>Any type of job (or investing etc) is fine as long as all that it requires is a laptop and 4 hours per day.\nI don&#x27;t know what to do. I can&#x27;t afford to take more than few weeks off. \nThank you so much for reading this.",
