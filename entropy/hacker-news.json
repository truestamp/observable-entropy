What is he missing? Alternateively are any of his points valid? Can any experts in the HN community &quot;steelman&quot; his argument?<p>I know there are professors out there like Andrew Appel at Princeton who have done a lot of computer science research into voting machines: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;~appel&#x2F;voting&#x2F;<p>The event stream is at frankspeech [dot] com",
