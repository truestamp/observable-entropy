      "text": "We launched Rubbrband to help you modify and delete cached data in frontend applications.<p>We found that companies struggle to debug their user’s website problems since they have no visibility into their user’s local cache. As a result, companies ask their users to clear the cache when their website isn’t loading. However, clearing the cache is only a temporary band-aid solution. We developed Rubbrband to let you monitor your user’s frontend cache and fix problems before they occur.<p>We’d love to hear what you think! If interested, please join the beta at rubbrband.com or email us at contact@rubbrband.com.",
