I use Duo at work; can you use that for arbitrary personal services? Are there others apps that come recommended?<p>Also, just general questions: are these apps usually free (if not, free isn&#x27;t a hard requirement)? Is there some standard, or does each service only support a subset of apps? What happens if you lose your phone?<p>Any info is appreciated",
