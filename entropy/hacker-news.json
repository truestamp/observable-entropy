      "text": "We believe the economy is better when everyone has access. When everyone has room to grow. No one should be left out because the cost is too great or the technology too complex. We started with a little white credit card reader but haven’t stopped there. We’re empowering the independent electrician to send invoices, setting up the favorite food truck with a delivery option, helping the ice cream shop pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location. We’re here to help sellers of all sizes start, run, and grow their business—and helping them grow their business is good business for everyone.<p>Have a internship in QA or are highly interested in QA, please apply directly at (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3qVNsNN) or DM me at (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3rBkl3c) and mention that you saw the post on HN.<p>Thanks!",
