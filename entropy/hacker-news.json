Just a decent job.<p>Or do you think it&#x27;s absolutely necessary to go through a Master&#x2F;PhD to get a decent job in that field?\nI honestly don&#x27;t think there is a (great)future in web dev plus it&#x27;s starting to bore me, so I want to switch.<p>Btw I&#x27;m based in western Europe.<p>Thanks",
