      "text": "A few days ago I read this article [1] where someone explained why he built his own static site generator (SSG).<p>The post is an interesting reading. However, I was impressed by the comments: there is a large amount of people that write their own SSG tool set rather than using (and modifying) an existing framework.<p>I understand the feeling, creating an SSG is a good project for learning a new programming language. Given that, I would like to ask you for resources about converting Markdown to HTML, maybe something like [2] or a relatively-small sized project like [3].<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28837760<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interpreterbook.com&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;Markdown&#x2F;",
