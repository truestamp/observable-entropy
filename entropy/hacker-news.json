      "text": "It seems that right now there is no browser that supports h.265&#x2F;HEVC <i>even on hardware that can decode it</i> - &quot;Old Edge&quot; used to, but &quot;New Edge&quot; does not. Neither Chrome nor Firefox support it (actually, both of those refuse to use any form of hardware decoding at all on my Windows box, only Edge uses it for VPx and h.264 - and of course every media player).<p>The only exception is Apple with Safari.<p>Why is this? h.265 can do a lot better than h.264 in some scenarios, but certainly isn&#x27;t worse.<p>And why, oh why, is debugging hardware video acceleration still such a nightmare, even on Windows? Firefox doesn&#x27;t even seem to have it in about:support any more!<p>And why is hardware video acceleration <i>only</i> a problem with browsers? I&#x27;ve never had any kind of problem with it with any media player, regardless of OS. It just works. But browsers - it seems to never work OOTB. Except for Edge, apparently. Which I <i>thought</i> was just a Chromium reskin with MS tracking.",
