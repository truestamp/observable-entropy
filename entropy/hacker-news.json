      "text": "What about crypto for childcare? Carecoin? Could this work?<p>I’m wondering if hypothetically, we could build a successful coin revolving care? I know a ton about childcare and education, but not so much about cryptocurrency, so I’m curious to hear your thoughts.<p>Basically, the way I’m thinking would work is you could mine coin by taking care of kids or the elderly, or really anyone who needed care and then you could potentially even  earn coin by taking care of your own kids, since that definitely helps the economy etc. And then obviously you pay for childcare, elder care, etc with the care coin.<p>Would this even work? I know a lot of education and childcare but not a ton about crypto.<p>Famous example of using a coin, scrip for swapping childcare, way before bitcoin, etc.  was the Capitol Hill  Babysitting Co-op<p>Said one member (according to wikipedia): \n“The currency issued by the co-op, called scrip was in extremely high demand, at least at some points, with a former member being quoted as saying &quot;Oh my God, you would kill for scrip. ... You would sell your children for scrip.&quot;<p>They had some problems and was a famous for going bust because of a liquidity trap. But doesn’t mean this can’t be done.",
