Does it get transferred to the shareholders, who would then all have to agree with each other to be able to relicense one day?\n2. Does it fall into public domain?\n3. The copyright is transferred to the state?\n4. It falls into some no man&#x27;s land and never can be relicensed?\n5. Maybe that&#x27;s a question that must get an explicit answer as part of the winding down procedure?\n6. Something else?",
