      "text": "I grew up in South America where computing culture wasn&#x27;t really a thing in the 90s and 2000s (at least in my neighborhood). After many years of programming and browsing through HN I&#x27;ve gotten interested in getting an older computer that I can &quot;fully understand.&quot; I want to be able to take it apart and know how the CPU, memory and graphics works all the way up, something I don&#x27;t think is possible in a modern computer. I also think they just look cool. I&#x27;ve seen some people mention the pdp11 and Vax machines. Any thoughts?",
