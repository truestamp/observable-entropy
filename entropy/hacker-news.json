      "text": "Curious if anyone else finds it increasingly difficult to play &quot;SSO roulette&quot; when logging into the long tail of infrequently-used services: did I use GitHub? Facebook? G Suite? Twitter? Or the secondary problem: &quot;if I used Google SSO, which of my gmail accounts did I use?&quot;<p>I definitely have my own heuristics (g suite for everything possible, github for &quot;technical&quot; sites, facebook as a throwaway, etc), but I&#x27;ve found myself increasingly &quot;getting it wrong.&quot; Not to mention this is worsened by the fact that some sites automatically create a new account for you if you log in with a non-existing account: this means you often end up creating a NEW account, further screwing yourself over.<p>Anyone have any good hacks to solve this? I&#x27;ve started resorting to storing a blank 1Password entry even for sites I SSO with, simply stating the SSO account and email I used.",
