      "text": "(Preface: I want this to be a philosophical question and NOT a political one. Please. If you can.)<p>I guess I am asking more on a national and&#x2F;or cultural level than a personal level. Why do people waste their time and energy hating each other?<p>I recently came across this[0] Wikipedia page on something called &quot;Sinophobia&quot; (which is a term I have never come across) and was actually very shocked at the length and amount of data presented in the article. I then clicked over related articles regarding Muslims[1] and Hindus[2] and found them astonishingly long as well. I just don&#x27;t understand why anyone would waste their time and energy and brainspace hating another group of people.<p>(For the record, I am a boring white dude, and have no feelings towards any particular race one way or the other. I live in a city where many cultures exist comfortably. Maybe that speaks to my bewilderment. I&#x27;ve seen actual, overt, real-life racism happen maybe 10 times in my 35 years. Also, I really hope this doesn&#x27;t turn into a complete shit show.)<p>---<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-Chinese_sentiment\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Islamophobia\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anti-Hindu_sentiment",
