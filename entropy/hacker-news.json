I can manually temporarily disable some services, but videos can stil be played indirectly, and she finds those holes.\nIt might be video-playing as such that must be blocked, but youtube is the major problem.\nIt&#x27;s not the content subject that is the problem, it&#x27;s their weaponized addictiveness.",
