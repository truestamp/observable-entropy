      "text": "I&#x27;ve heard the reason that global automakers cancelled chip orders in the early months of the pandemic and then decided to order them anyway a few months later and that caused a backlog.But I also hear that those are 120nm chips.<p>So why are graphics cards, gaming consoles etc out of stock? Why is Apple attributing fewer iPhones sold to semiconductor shortage?<p>Can automakers not use a 7nm fab?<p>How much of the chip shortage can be attributed to AMD and Apple taking the laptop market away from Intel? And if this is true, does this mean that Intel now has unused capacity?",
