      "text": "I saw an informative tech talk &#x2F; presentation on Youtube some time ago where the discussion was around power vs utility in software.

The more specific and tailored software is to specific cases the more &quot;useful&quot; it is despite being less powerful.<p>The talk may have used a term other than &quot;power&quot; but I can&#x27;t remember",
