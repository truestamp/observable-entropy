      "text": "Sorry if already old news, but I just got my twitter blocked permanently and that makes me feel weird. This seemed to make sense when it happened to others as I thought Trump had it coming, but blocking my account doesn&#x27;t make sense at all.<p>I have at most 5 re-tweets ever and possibly 2 comments. Last activity was more than a year ago.<p>I just looked at their rules and I couldn&#x27;t have broke any of the Safety ones neither the ones from Privacy.<p>The only rules I see as subjective enough to possibly explain a blocking of my account would be the ones from Authenticity. But then again, I didn&#x27;t create content on the platform, I only re-shared it. Does that mean that all the users that re-shared with similar patterns got banned (from what I remember, the users I re-tweeted had a high number of followers)?<p>I guess punishing at random, on a permanent timeline and without any previous notice is an easy way to change views. I do see now the sense behind the whole movement against cancellation policy.",
