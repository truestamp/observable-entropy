However, lately I&#x27;ve been hearing more about random account disables and how difficult it is to get your account restored [0].<p>So, I&#x27;ve slowly started putting in backup systems in case my accounts get disabled, starting with using my own domain name for inbound email from all services.<p>I use Cloudflare to route inbound emails to my domain to my gmail account, which, btw, is backed up locally. Now, if my gmail account ever gets disabled, I can route all inbound to another account and recover some of my services.<p>However, this left me wondering, what are the risks of this approach (asides from Cloudflare having visibility into my emails)?<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;__ChrisR__&#x2F;status&#x2F;1368955992105484290",
