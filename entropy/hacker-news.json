      "text": "There’s the usual discussion about how easy it is to continuously and mindlessly browse HN, Twitter, Reddit, etc.<p>It often starts with a simple checking out what’s new and devolves into longer periods of browsing. I noticed that this begins almost subconsciously, as an impulse.<p>What I started doing is that every time that I feel the impulse, the urge of checking the cellphone, I stop for 10 seconds and bring that urge to consciousness.<p>This is related to Kahneman’s thesis of two separate systems. After this 10 seconds, I ask myself if I really want to check that page, that app. Usually, I do not and avoid it completely.<p>It can be useful to log all these urges throughout the day. You should see that the number per day will decrease.<p>Have you tried anything similar? With what results?",
