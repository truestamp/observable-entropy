      "text": "Kubernetes has been around for 7 years now.<p>I often think about Kubernetes as a Cloud Operating System (an interface to operate a cloud infrastructure).<p>Coming from the Linux ecosystem, where every distribution has a package manager (be it apt for debs, dnf for rpms, etc...), it seems weird to me that no such solution exists (AFAIK) for Kubernetes.<p>So far, we&#x27;ve seen Helm&#x2F;Tanka which looks a lot like the tar.gz archives you&#x27;d deploy on a Slackware and wish for the lack of conflicts. In other words: no true dependency management (even with subcharts).<p>Same with FluxCD and ArgoCD, you need to write yourself the source and wire the dependencies together yourself. This is like giving you APT without a repository (dpkg?).<p>I just wish I could say &quot;I have this package, it relies on cert-manager to generate certificates, install it if it&#x27;s not already&quot;.<p>I wish I could have a `PackageRepository` resource that would act like a line in your APT&#x27;s sources.list and deploy `PackageDefinition` resources in my cluster.<p>I wish I could have a `Package` resource that would deploy my application and its dependencies if not already installed.<p>You would get the following commands out of the box:<p><pre><code>  - kubectl get repositories -&gt; list the repositories configured in your cluster\n  - kubectl get pkgdefs -&gt; list available packages in your cluster\n  - kubectl get packages -&gt; list installed packages in your cluster\n</code></pre>\nThe underlying package could be an Helm chart, a kapp-controller manifest, or ArgoCD applications. It does not really matter (it would be like tar.gz vs tar.xz vs ... for your Linux package manager).<p>Is there work on this subject going on? Is it worth putting time into it (seems a lot of work)?<p>What do you think HN?",
