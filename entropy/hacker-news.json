      "text": "Recently found that my LG Dryer &amp; Washer are uploading&#x2F;downloading 1GB of data per day. I looked into it after the LGThinQApp&#x27;s privacy policy changed to gather information like personal information like DOB, gender, voice recordings, profile photos, network activity: &quot;such as URL, ad block info, redirect URL, bookmark history etc.. Their privacy policy looks like it was meant for instagram..<p>This wasn&#x27;t the case at all before when I purchased the product. The nice feature was that I could preload my clothes and trigger them to wash&#x2F;dry before I&#x27;m about to get home. That&#x27;s all I expected from this. I even called support and asked them to deactivate my account but they said this can only be done through the app. And I can&#x27;t use the app unless I accept the new terms and services.",
