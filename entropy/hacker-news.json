I can&#x27;t read body language. The tone of voice, micro-experessions and social cues get lost.<p>If you, too, accidentally talk too much too often, check it out &quot;Unblah&quot;. Watch the quick 2-minute demo and download the macOS app over at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unblah.me&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unblah.me&#x2F;</a>.<p>Cheers!<p>Alexis<p>PS: There’s a whole FAQ section for common questions you may have – Including if this is yet another &quot;native&quot; Electron app ;)<p>edit: bullet-list formatting",
