      "text": "This app came out of &quot;scratch your own itch&quot;. We&#x27;re a small remote company and we often travel, go to conferences, meetups etc. - well at least before COVID-19. We&#x27;re pretty conscious about security and know how to set up our own Macs. That&#x27;s why Nejc, the cofounder, was shocked when he saw he forgot to set up FileVault months after buying his new Mac.<p>Then the story repeated itself when he was talking to a coworker. Neither of them are newbies to computers, security or Macs and both of them were sure they had it set up.\nWhat Pareto Security does is checks regularly that all of these basics are taken care of.<p>Here&#x27;s the current list of checks:\n- Automatic login is off\n- Boot is secure\n- Firewall is on\n- FileVault is on\n- Gatekeeper is on\n- Password after inactivity\n- Password to unlock preferences\n- Remote Login is off\n- Remote Management is off\n- Screen saver shows in 5 min\n- Sharing files is off\n- Sharing printers is off<p>We plan on adding more and we&#x27;re building the Teams dashboard for companies that should be available in a few weeks.<p>Check it out here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paretosecurity.app<p>The app is priced pretty inexpensively but we are giving it away for free with the <i>100% discount coupon code: HACKERNEWS</i> (active until 3rd October)<p>We also launched on Product Hunt if you want to support us there.\nWould love to hear your feedback!",
