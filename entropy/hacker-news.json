      "text": "Hi! I&#x27;m building a react app that needs a very powerful and customizable WYSIWYG editor. I will start by implementing things that  Ghost, Medium, Typora, and Gitbook editor can do, and then maybe need to add other powerful features including collaboration. My project is in early prototype stage, so I don&#x27;t even know what kind of features I may need to build in the future.<p>What are my best options, which libraries should I consider?<p>Did anyone experiment with Slate.js, ProseMirror, Tiptap, other libraries I may not be aware of? Which ones are the most flexible&#x2F;powerful, and future proof enough to build a long term project around?<p>Also, a side question - how hard is it to implement google-docs-like pagination in a WYSIWYG web text editor? I&#x27;ve asked on Slate.js chat, and apparently it&#x27;s very hard, although I don&#x27;t quite understand the reasons and details. Any tips on tackling that?",
