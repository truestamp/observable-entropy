      "text": "I see no point in developing Web interfaces for internal company needs. TUI are cross platform, are obviously interactive, update-able in real time if needed, just like a web application.<p>I am proposing this because in our place we are constantly in a lack of a front developers to actually implement interfaces for outside public, so there is no way we can get one assigned for internal needs.<p>While creating TUIs is simple, and can be done by a backend dev without descending into the hellpit of yarn, node, npm; or even learning Django which looks like an overkill",
