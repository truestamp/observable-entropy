      "text": "Hey all, my co-founder (@adamjwalker) and I have been working on TogetherLetters for a few months. We all realize that people aren&#x27;t (can&#x27;t be?) authentic on social media. So we decided to launch an automatic regular newsletter for groups to share honest updates.<p>TogetherLetters sends members of a group an email for an update and then combines all the updates from group members into a group newsletter. Importantly, updates are never published on the web so we&#x27;ve seen people be honest, vulnerable, and authentic in updates and thus get help and support from their groups.<p>We have a few paying users but we&#x27;d love for more folks to check it out and give us feedback - good and bad - about what we&#x27;re doing. Groups of 10 or less are free forever (bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly newsletters) and paid groups start at just $5&#x2F;mo (weekly newsletters and up to 50 members).<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.togetherletters.com<p>Thanks!",
