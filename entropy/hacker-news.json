      "text": "Startup culture is one very wild ride, I took a few moonshots with the assumption that, hey, how many times can I shoot at the moon and miss? Like, 100? 500?  1,000?<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I could have done it a thousand times but whatever the answer is it&#x27;s more than about 20 anyway.  I got as far as term sheets from large investment funds but never really made it to market. I realize this comes with a certain approach and personality, a certain way to manage my time, projects, what I aim for, how I behave, and so forth.<p>Now I would like to completely change my lifestyle of brinkmanship and taking nothing but moonshots, in order to prepare for being a father.  (This is due to having someone new in my life and making a mutual decision together.)<p>What general tips do you have for how to change my mindset, lifestyle, and approach, to prepare to be a father?",

My last client was truly epic; wonderful people and revenue in the billions but front end couldn&#x27;t be more soul crushing anymore for me and no other opportunities there AFAIK.<p>I&#x27;d rather be working with objects, data, architecture and optimization.
