I know the main differences, as in a VPS gives you more control of the server and the stack you would be using.<p>Say I wanted to host Wordpress on a VPS: What is the main advantage of doing that over, say, a $5.00&#x2F;month subscription to a  shared hosting provider who often have one click installs of Wordpress and you also don&#x27;t have to harden that Wordpress instance (e.g Apache gets automatically updated on a shared hosting provider, among other things).<p>What would you go for personally.
