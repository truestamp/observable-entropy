      "text": "In November last year, I had made a donation online, to a non-profit.<p>Fast forward today, I notice the monthly donation and want to cancel it going forward. There is no way to do it online. So I call them up, the person says they can&#x27;t help and I should leave my number and they&#x27;d call back. I ask them politely why they make it so easy to give money, but so difficult to cancel. They give some word-soup answer, a collection of words which sounded like a sentence but with zero meaning or usefulness.<p>By now, we are all familiar with this &quot;model&quot;, the most (in)famous example being the NT Times. Looks like non-profits have started doing it too, which is depressing.<p>How does one handle these, short of stopping use of credit cards completely online? Is there any recourse at all?",
