They want me to verify the Identity Verification Form and Affidavit by a notary in Germany.<p>After I told them that this introduces high costs they told me that the form could be signed by my lawyer. Doing that and sending the copy of my identity card was still not enough since they went back to their previous demand that the form needs to be signed by the notary.<p>Now I have no access to the account and I guess if you want to be on the safe GDPR side one should just chose Hetzner.",
