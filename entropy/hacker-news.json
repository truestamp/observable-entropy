Or focus on one specialization from the beginning? How do you choose if you like all of them? How much should I optimize for money in my age? Do you prefer to be a generalist or an specialist?<p>Just to give you some context, I am 27, working at a FAANG company as a ML engineer since 2020<p>I am interested in wide variety of subjects:<p>- Classic backend development (3 years of experience)<p>- ML engineering (2 years of experience)<p>- Applied research in deep learning (My master&#x27;s degree is deep learning for NLP)<p>- Intersection of systems &amp; deep learning like how to accelerate training, inference, ....
