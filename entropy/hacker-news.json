      "text": "Hello Hacker News!<p>HEYHEY is a service that will hopefully bridge the different parts of people&#x27;s online life. So far, I&#x27;ve spent about 2 months developing it, and as a college student, it honestly helped me learn more about computer science than any undergrad course we have. Also, after getting the inspiration from HN, I wanted to prove to myself that, in 2022, anyone could build a full-fledged web service alone. Thanks to its modern-yet-traditional infrastructure, HEYHEY is costing me about 0 dollars a month to run (so far!).<p>I really wanted to keep the service simple and functional. So naturally, I tried to stay away from a JS-based front-end. Instead, HEYHEY uses simple HTML pages with modern CSS and forms to function (you can disable JS!). Last week, I silently turned on registers, and if you register today, you will have a 10% chance to get Pro for life — it enables custom usernames (heyhey.to&#x2F;[username]) and rich themes.<p>I am not trying to take over the &quot;Linktree&quot; space, nor trying to build a unicorn startup. After making HEYHEY presentable, I just wanted others to have access to it as well. I hope to keep developing HEYHEY so that it can further integrate with other social platforms while staying lightweight and functional. Would love to hear your feedback!<p>If you registered and want to delete your account, just shoot an email to: friends@heyhey.to",
