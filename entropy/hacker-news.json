Ultimately, whoever is involved will get a massive discount. Also your feedback will quite literally impact the product the way you want.<p>The only requirement is that you should be a paying user of a PaaS provider (Netlify, Heroku, Vercel, etc.) now or have been one in the past (it&#x27;s just about the accuracy of the feedbacks)<p>Please let me know here or DM me on Twitter (MohsenKamranii).",
