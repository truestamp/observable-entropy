      "text": "Hey all,\nI wanted to share with you this cool platform for developers that lets you build conversational AI apps in a matter of hours. Even a non-developer can build a demo app in less than 2 hours.<p>Why is Dasha unique?<p>* We have our own intuitive programming language - DashaScript. It&#x27;s an event-driven language intended to describe a conversation script.<p>* We created Dasha Studio, an extension to VSCode. You use the studio to create your conversational script, it gives you syntax analysis and highlight. There&#x27;s also a visual graph editor.<p>* Dasha CLI that lets you log in and get your API key that you can then use to execute conversational AI apps, and get diagnostic information about current usage, queues, and limits on Dasha Cloud Platform side.<p>* Dasha Cloud provides conversational AI as a service, which means that you don’t need to be a machine learning engineer to use machine learning when building Dasha conversational apps.<p>* We use GRPC for communication between SDK and the Dasha Cloud (more on that here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dasha.ai&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;conversational-application)<p>What apps can you build?<p>To illustrate how to build a conversational app and show its capabilities, here&#x27;s an tutorial on how to get started developing your first conversational AI app: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dasha.ai&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-conversational-AI-app-1<p>You can create apps for free, so give it a try: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dasha.ai&#x2F;en-us&#x2F; (just click on &quot;API key&quot; button and we&#x27;ll provide you one so you can start building)<p>Also, we&#x27;re hiring a DevRel, so if you are one or know one, apply or reach out! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;dashaai&#x2F;Dasha-is-hiring-6f2156ae251e4e9b94c841fff4fcd976",

      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I have started FBG some years ago when I moved to the Bay Area and could not find a simple, cross-platform, no-registration way to play board games with my friends back in my home country. I also wanted to make it simple to create multiplayer board games online for developers in their free time.<p>Shortly after, I found out about boardgame.io with similar goals and decided to join forces with them. It became the engine of our board games, and we focused on publishing&#x2F;serving them. To be fair with everyone and inspired by Wikipedia, we made the project a non-profit with GPLv3 Affero license.<p>Since then, the project has gotten many amazing contributors that developed really cool board games, added translations, helped with infra, etc (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freeboardgames.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;about ...). My focus has been on the infrastructure (scaling, adding text chat, etc).<p>During the pandemic, we saw a large 30x increase in usage, and it also became more useful for me, as I started using it at work for (now virtual) fun team meeting events.<p>Please check it out and give any feedback! I&#x27;ve been postponing submitting on HN for a long time because I always felt it &quot;wasn&#x27;t ready enough&quot; as there are a ton of rough edges, but I came to the realization that this feeling might never go away.",
