      "text": "There was a blog post within the last year or two on HN that compared a codebase to a professional kitchen. It talked about how someone inexperienced might walk into a kitchen and see superficial signs that it was dirty, but an experienced kitchen worker would know that the parts that matter were clean. There might be scuffs and scorch marks that aren&#x27;t worth cleaning, while the spots that could grow bacteria or contaminate food have been kept spotless. This was used as an analogy for what really makes a codebase &quot;clean&quot;, distinguishing the things that matter from the things that are purely aesthetic. I thought it was really insightful.<p>I&#x27;ve had trouble searching for this article. Anybody remember what it was?",
