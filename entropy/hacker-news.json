      "text": "I use to check new jobs every week to know how requirements and salaries are changing, this year I&#x27;ve noticed a quite dramatic surge in Cryto related jobs with really good salaries, three years ago I interviewed for three crypto related companies and none of them survived, they just got some investment and disappeared. Since then and after the massive surge of crypto miners mafias last year I ended up hating the lack of transparency, environmental ethics and their dirty marketing therefore I wouldn&#x27;t accept a job on that field.\nWould you accept a job in Crypto? I wonder if I&#x27;m missing something?",
