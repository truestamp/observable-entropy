      "text": "Hi all,<p>My dad and I run our family business that is highly email reliant. We are currently using GoDaddy&#x27;s grandfathered unlimited business email plan (yes, I know), and it&#x27;s been pretty bulletproof for around 15 years, but we want a modern web interface and more control. We only need email, calendars, and contacts for 5 users, so Fastmail is an option we are considering.<p>Is anyone here using Fastmail for their email-heavy business or profession, and if so, what&#x27;s your experience been like? Have you felt restricted by Fastmail&#x27;s lack of cloud integrations and other services that Google Workplace and and Microsoft 365 have? Any issues with uptime, deliverability, and support, especially given the latter is email only?<p>Any feedback is appreciated!",
