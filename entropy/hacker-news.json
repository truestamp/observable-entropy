We saw even better results on dimensionhq&#x2F;volt, with our build times cut down from 3 minutes to just 1 minute - a 3x speed improvement!<p>How does fleet work?<p>Fleet works by optimizing your builds using existing tooling available in the Rust ecosystem, including seamlessly integrating sccache, lld, zld, ramdisks (for those using WSL or HDD&#x27;s) et al.<p>You can get fleet at the official website.<p>Check out fleet over at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dimensionhq&#x2F;fleet and our website at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fleet.rs<p>Looking forward to your feedback and thoughts!",

I am particularly keen to hear from people who underwent the journey from skeptics to believers in the space.",
