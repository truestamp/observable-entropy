The roughest spots at the moment are the threading of comments and the fetching of posts on a user&#x27;s page (lots of individual calls (async) for individual items rather than getting them in bulk from an endpoint like &#x2F;v0&#x2F;beststories).<p>Let me know what parts of it are Not Good and where I can improve things!",
