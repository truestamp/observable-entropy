I&#x27;m socially awkward and bad at talking, especially so when I don&#x27;t have much in common with the other person. I don&#x27;t think I have a good sense of humor and I tend to have a cynical and pessimistic outlook on things, i.e I&#x27;m not what one would call a &quot;fun guy&quot;.\nSo I run out of topics to talk about and the conversation quickly becomes boring for both of us, even though we&#x27;re genuinely interested in each other.<p>Please note: I won&#x27;t be taking &quot;Find someone else&quot; as an answer.",
