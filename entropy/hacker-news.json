      "text": "Greetings! I&#x27;ve developed a new service called TFstate.dev!<p>TFstate.dev is a free-to-use hosted HTTP Backend for Terraform State Storage that is accessible using a GitHub Token.<p>The backend API is Open Source for transparency and confidence that your state files are securely hosted: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tfstate&#x2F;github-sls-rest-api\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tfstate&#x2F;github-sls-rest-api</a><p>There&#x27;s no signup or registration, and with a GitHub token, you can immediately start using this as a Terraform Backend. State is secured and encrypted in Amazon S3 using KMS. State Locking is also natively supported.<p>Using it is as simple as generating a GitHub token, setting a few lines of config in Terraform, then enjoying the benefits of Shared and Secure state storage without first signing up for TF Cloud or creating S3 buckets, DDB tables and juggling Access Credentials just to get the same feature set.<p>I&#x27;d love to get everyone&#x27;s feedback, and if you&#x27;re currently using a different Terraform State backend, feel free to migrate to this service to store your state.<p>Let me know what you think!<p>Christian",
