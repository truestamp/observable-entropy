We also tried to include non-tech teams in the task management tool to keep them in the feedback loop in the same place as development and product teams. There are so many other ways I don’t even remember them...<p>This is how the idea of Producter.co was born.<p>I’m really curious how you manage user feedback, and is it possible for you to keep stakeholders in the feedback loop? or do you handle all these manually?",
