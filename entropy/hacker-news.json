      "text": "I just saw that the latest iphone update allows you to unlock the phone with a facemask on, which got me thinking: I&#x27;m surprised there haven&#x27;t been more published exploits that make use of this attack vector. While Apple might have the means to make this relatively robust, I&#x27;d suspect the fractured android ecosystem would lead to a lot of half-baked implementations, and the literature on the fragility of ML models w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t adversarial input would suggest that even Apple&#x27;s model should still be susceptible. I recall there being a lot of hubub over police having the tools to crack iOS encryption, which would seem like a harder task than fooling a facial recognition algorithm. How are there so few exploits for facial recognition login floating around?",
