      "text": "I want to make simple apps for myself:\n1. On my computer, I use a program called human (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dnsosebee&#x2F;human). It&#x27;s pretty simple: you make scripts for yourself, where when you run them you get 1 line of instruction at a time. For example, an exercise script might be:\nget yoga mat and phone\ngo outside with yoga mat and lay it down\nuse fitness app on phone for exercise routine<p>while this one might seem simple, have some routines (especially my night routine) codified makes them both easier to actually run alongside being easier to improve over time. \nI&#x27;d like to be able to run these programs on a smartwatch instead of only on my laptop (since it&#x27;s much more convenient that waywhile outside)<p>2. I want to be able to quickly log issues&#x2F;mistakes during the day. What I have in mind is something like: [trigger voice assistant] record mistake [details of mistake] and then have it add that to a list I can review at the end of the day. or to have an app I can open and tap to trigger something similar.<p>I think this might rule out android wear since apparently you can&#x27;t run custom commands.<p>What do you guys think? Any recommendations?",
