I discovered early on that there is no one who will give any feedback due to legal reasons.<p>The concept would be simple: For $100, you do a 30 to 60 minute interview with a technical person who has done interviews before. Within 24 hours, you get a write up on what you did right, what you did wrong, and what you can improve on. The interviewer would get paid $75 for his or her time.<p>Is a service like this viable?
