We are producing key sets of data, wrangling them and providing various products derived from them to colleagues downstream.<p>I often notice that the less &quot;techie&quot; colleagues of mine are dealing with a simple problem for days, wasting time.<p>I would like to establish a meeting of some sort where people exchange problems they are struggling with. The main point would be to exchange knowledge and in this way increase efficiency.<p>Example: renaming 50 files by hand. Why not write a two line program for this task?!<p>Does anyone have experience with this type of gathering? How do I get people to share their struggles and make them learn new ways of dealing with them?",
