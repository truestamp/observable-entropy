      "text": "The recently active ASK HN[1] triggered me to post a question that has been frustrating me quite a lot.<p>Over the decade long career in the industry, I have ended up with multiple people who either don&#x27;t care about the team or are just plain incompetent but get by amazingly using their people-gaming skills.<p>More than a couple times I have ended up switching jobs because I was either unwilling to (in early &quot;naive idealist&quot; days) or was unable to call bullshit on this kind of behavior (due to lack of certain skills). But now I am at point in my career where I feel like this is the muscle I want to flex.<p>For the record, I don&#x27;t have personal enmity with co-workers who coast along or move up the ladder based on whatever strategies they employ. What I am looking to learn is how do you stop these kind of behavior from taking a toll on rest of the team? Specially if you&#x27;re the peer bearing the brunt of their actions and not their manager.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29581125",
