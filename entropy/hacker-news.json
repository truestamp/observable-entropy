      "text": "I&#x27;m Sid Sijbrandij and I love reading Hacker News. I almost always read the comment section and when there is a summary of the article in there that is frequently helpful. But most articles don&#x27;t have a summary so I want to hire someone to create more summaries.<p>I hope that this will make Hacker News more enjoyable and efficient to use for its readers. Many times it takes a while to figure out what the article is about, a summary would allow people a quick way to see if they are interested in investing that time.<p>There are potential downsides:\n1. People only read the summary and not the full article.\n2. The summary might not be clear or correct.\n3. People who already read the article don&#x27;t want to see the summary.<p>With a one month experiment we should have a better idea if HNSS is worth it.<p>If it is here to stay we can also see if the summary can become an official part of HN.<p>The writer of the summaries should:\n1. Be able to do this for a month\n2. Have at least 20 comments on Hacker News\n3. Be able to invoice me as a contractor<p>Apply via https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLSdmM0gvAAmuEcHmFUzNx4DRd4JY93BfUMNZrdRQYinfmgc3bw&#x2F;viewform?usp=sf_link",
