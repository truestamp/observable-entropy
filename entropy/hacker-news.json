While choosing a backend solution firebase seems ideal in terms of simple document database but the storage may be in the 100 Gb per month.<p>I&#x27;m also looking to move away from Firebase if the app takes off and backblaze seems to have very interesting pricing as well.<p>What would you advice, please?",
