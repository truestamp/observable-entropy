On occasion I&#x27;d find myself wanting a UI, so I&#x27;d reach for Qt.<p>But it seems more and more that it would be really useful to learn web development. The web is ubiquitous these days, and tools like Tauri take some of the smell out of Electron, so it can be pressed into device on the desktop.<p>It seems all the FE web dev guides are about learning the latest flavour of the month (React, Angular, Vue, etc...) and not about understanding how any of it works, what design patterns are useful, performance trade-offs, etc...<p>Is there a &quot;FE dev for the experienced system engineer&quot; type of resource?",
