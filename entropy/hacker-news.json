You can&#x27;t access this item because it is in violation of our Terms of Service. If you feel this is in error, please request a review. Find out more about this topic at the Google Drive Help Center.&quot;<p>If I click the request a review I get:<p>&quot;404. That&#x27;s an error. Sorry, this item cannot be found or is not available.&quot;<p>This spreadsheet simply had metrics and domains. I find it near impossible it was violating any terms of service unless there is a shadow blacklist of domain names which somehow trigger a file being removed. And I&#x27;m left with no recourse to even request a review or get my file back?<p>I turned on airplane mode on my phone and was able to get an old cached copy, export was only possible as a PDF. So at least I have a slightly stale version of raw data that way.<p>Even as a paying customer, this is pretty embarrassing and there seems no recourse is possible?",

      "text": "Camera manufacturers seem to be moving at speed from DSLRs to mirrorless. In case of Canon, that means a different lens mount. Since I&#x27;ll need to use an adapter for my current lenses anyway, it seems like a good time to re-evaluate brands. Some questions after using a Canon 7D:<p>- Is keeping my lenses and moving to a different brand of mirrorless a dumb idea in the first place?<p>- Can EF mount lenses be fully utilised with mirrorless cameras? That is, can I shoot pretty much the same pictures, or am I going to lose significant light&#x2F;zoom&#x2F;other?<p>- The raw image format is completely proprietary and only used by Canon. Are any of the other vendors better at making life easier for photo editing programs?<p>- The original firmware is not very flexible. For example, requiring an external device for continuous shooting seems crazy. Magic Lantern[1], as impressive as it is, seems to suck battery and the UI is less friendly than the original. And if I understand correctly Canon is making it harder, not easier, for third party firmware with newer models. Are there any particularly good brands for moddability (without having to be a firmware engineer myself)?<p>- The image quality is decent. Within similar price brackets it seems like most cameras are too similar to be a deal breaker. Is that a reasonable view?<p>- Light sensitivity is not great. I don&#x27;t like using flash, which means pretty much anything indoors needs to be fully open and slow. Do any brands&#x2F;cameras stand out in this category?<p>- It works decently as a webcam, except that it outputs a weird format which doesn&#x27;t include microphone audio. Is this still a problem with mirrorless cameras?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;magiclantern.fm&#x2F;",
