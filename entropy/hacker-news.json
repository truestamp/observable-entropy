      "text": "It was the oddest experience yet in almost a decade experience of professional programming.<p>A coding exercise for a &#x27;blub&#x27; programming position at a company that claims to have all their code in &#x27;blub&#x27;. Since this particular &#x27;blub&#x27; dialect doesn&#x27;t have a lot of native &#x27;blub&#x27; programmers the company&#x27;s coding exercise is geared towards non-&#x27;blub&#x27; programmers. But in this case they are interviewing a &#x27;blub&#x27; programmer. In fact &#x27;blub&#x27; is this programmer&#x27;s favorite language.<p>Upon opening the repo with the setup and the exercise instructions 2&#x2F;3rd of the instructional links do not work.<p>The programmer advises the company of this, the company representative claims that they are looking into it and will get back with an answer as soon as they can. After some time the candidate reaches out. No response, waits a few days more, reaches out, no response.<p>Then two weeks later the candidate is informed they will not be moving forward.<p>The coding exercise was not the first step. The candidate had seemingly passed the initial phone screen and a rather rigorous iq test.<p>Why such a lack of consideration? Do these companies have a clue as to how bad a taste is left in the mouth to be treated in this way?",
