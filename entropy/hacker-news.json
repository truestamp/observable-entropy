      "text": "Hi everyone! We are engineers from Microsoft&#x2F;LinkedIn, and we released an open-source Feature Store called Feathr a few weeks ago (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linkedin&#x2F;feathr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linkedin&#x2F;feathr</a>). It has many highlights like below. Feel free to check out the repository and let us know if there are any questions! We also have a few blogs and recordings in case folks want to learn a bit more about it:<p>Open Sourcing Feathr (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.linkedin.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;open-sourcing-feathr---linkedin-s-feature-store-for-productive-m\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.linkedin.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;open-sourcing-fea...</a>)<p>Feathr + Azure integration (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azure.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;feathr-linkedin-s-feature-store-is-now-available-on-azure&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azure.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;feathr-linkedin-s-fea...</a>).<p>Tech talks on Feathr (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gZg01UKQMTY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gZg01UKQMTY</a>)<p>And its highlights include (more highlights are in github repo):<p>Battle tested in production for more than 6 years: LinkedIn has been using Feathr in production for over 6 years and have a dedicated team improving it.<p>Scalable with built-in optimizations: For example, based on some internal use case, Feathr can process billions of rows and PB scale data with built-in optimizations such as bloom filters and salted joins.<p>Rich support for point-in-time joins and aggregations: Feathr has high performant built-in operators designed for Feature Store, including time-based aggregation, sliding window joins, look-up features, all with point-in-time correctness.<p>Derived Features and centralized Feature Registry which encourage feature consumers to build features on existing features and encouraging feature reuse.<p>Happy to chat about it if anyone is interested in it!",
