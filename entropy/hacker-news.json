But I think working as software engineer would legitimize me as a technical person moving forward and enable me to write scalable and reliable code. Technical co-founders seem more in-demand than product people.<p>However, I feel I have more to learn on the product side. I&#x27;m scared to remove myself from the technical side for too long and not be able to return. How important are years of experience as a software engineer to be a technical co-founder?",
