      "text": "I&#x27;m a long time user of DynamoDB for various reasons. I never had to chance to use Postgres for real world. Now, have a new startup and my data model and access patterns do not seem feasible for Dynamo or other document&#x2F;nosql DBs at all. I&#x27;ll be probably using Aurora. Another reason is I want to learn Postgres, because its mostly a safer  choice. I&#x27;m a Spring Boot&#x2F;Kotlin person because it is currently the fastest way to production for my startup and idea.<p>What guides, good resources can anyone recommend for someone in my position? Everyone here on HN recommends &quot;Postgres is good enough for you, don&#x27;t look for adventure&quot; in many posts&#x2F;comments, so thought that would be a good place to ask.",
