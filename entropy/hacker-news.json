      "text": "We are super excited to be open sourcing the Svix webhooks dispatcher!\nSvix makes it easy to send webhooks. You send your payload to Svix, and Svix takes care of deliverability, retries, security, and more.<p>You can read more about why we built Svix in the original Show HN[0], though the gist is: our customers wanted webhooks to build integrations and workflows around our product, but we weren&#x27;t willing to commit the engineering time, resources and ongoing maintenance required of a webhook delivery system.<p>Why open source?\nOn a personal level, I&#x27;ve been an open source maintainer and contributor for many years, and I care a lot about open source. So open-sourcing the Svix dispatcher was one of the first tickets I created on our issue tracker.\nAs for the company, webhooks are currently a mess, everyone does them differently, with differing levels of quality and features supported. This is something we really want to fix. The Svix service is already making a difference there (we&#x27;re lucky enough to call some really cool companies our customers), and open-sourcing the dispatcher is the next logical step to increase our impact.<p>Why Rust?\nIt&#x27;s really fast, it makes writing secure and correct code easier, it&#x27;s easier to deploy and distribute (one static binary), and it&#x27;s a lot more fun. :)<p>Webhooks are really cool, and I absolutely love what they enable. They make the web compose-able, interconnected, and enable people to automate a lot of their work! Our goal is to make them easy, reliable, and consistent, so that more services offer them and they are easier to consume.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback! We&#x27;ve incorporated most of the comments we got the last time[0] (thanks again everyone!), and we would love to know how we can improve the product further. Got any suggestions?<p>Homepage: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svix.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svix.com</a><p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;svix&#x2F;svix-webhooks&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;svix&#x2F;svix-webhooks&#x2F;</a><p>Docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.svix.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.svix.com&#x2F;</a><p>API reference: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.svix.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.svix.com&#x2F;</a><p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26399672\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26399672</a>",

I&#x27;m interested in building and selling DevOps tools and wonder if targeting a low friction price point would be a good idea. Is there an amount that doesn&#x27;t require an expense report? Subscriptions might be auto-approved but annoying if you have to expense it every month. Hopefully this question will benefit anyone targeting audiences working at large corporations.",
