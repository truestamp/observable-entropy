I am writing a satire novel in which the first crewed mission to Mars has place.<p>Although it hasn&#x27;t to be 100% realistic (and it isn&#x27;t part of the plot), I&#x27;d like to try to be faithful to reality. Is there any book that explains more about the costs of a mission like that, different industrial needs, etc? If it isn&#x27;t a book it is welcome as well (a documentary, for example).<p>Thank you very much!",
