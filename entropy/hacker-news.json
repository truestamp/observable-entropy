If i don&#x27;t pass the next 4 assignments i will fail the lab, but i keep avoiding sitting down with all of my power. I feel pure fear and a sense of &quot;i will certainly fail if i try&quot;.<p>The above example is with these assignments, but this type of behavior extends to everything in my life.",
