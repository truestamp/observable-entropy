I just don&#x27;t see anything from the other mainstream US media except POTUS talking points, and the international TV stations that are still on the air do the same -- just toned down a bit.<p>I guess you could say with some accuracy that Fox News (US) is anti-US, at least anti-Democrats, and anti-US-when-there-is-a-Democrat-POTUS, so it really does provide another point of view on things, at least occassionally, which is a good thing, imo.<p>CGTN (China) was, up until a couple of weeks ago, anti-US in the sense that they weren&#x27;t actively supporting the White House line on everything, but the past couple of weeks - during war on ukraine - they just show a repeating loop of Xi giving a speech to some factory workers.<p>NDTV (India) has been fulltime on their elections - not sure if they&#x27;re going to cover Ukraine - doesn&#x27;t look like it so far.<p>If a station is very pro-US or doesn&#x27;t say anything too bad about US intentions, they get labeled on youtube as:<p>&gt; [TV Station] is sponsored in whole or in part by the government of [Country]<p>If, on the other hand, a station is _rabidly_ pro-US, they get labeled:<p>&gt; [TV Station Name] is a [Country&#x2F;French&#x2F;Turkish&#x2F;etc.] public service&#x27;<p>If a station hates on US policy&#x2F;intentions&#x2F;anything, they&#x27;re off the air&#x2F;net.<p>What international news channels (or others?) am I missing -- that are still on the air&#x2F;internet?<p>TYT -- young turks? No.",
