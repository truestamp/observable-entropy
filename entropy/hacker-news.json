      "text": "There&#x27;s a website called www.fool.com.au which I&#x27;m fairly sure is algorithmically generating articles about publicly listed stocks.<p>If you Google the following phrase to find articles with the stock ticker (APT: After Pay) on the site fool.com.au<p><pre><code>   &quot;APT&quot; site:www.fool.com.au\n</code></pre>\nYou end up getting 10,000 results, majority of which are unique articles containing 2 or 3 paragraphs of text. They release a new article every few hours in some cases, just to show up in Google&#x27;s &quot;News&quot; results.<p>I don&#x27;t believe a human is manually writing about a single stock for 10,000 articles, so in my view it&#x27;s highly likely that these are driven by some kind of article-writing software, GPT-3 could easily write these things from what I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Is it unethical of the website to do this? Should google demote these results? Or label it as &quot;Generated by AI&quot;?",
