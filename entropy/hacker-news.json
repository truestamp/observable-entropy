      "text": "Hello HN, I&#x27;d love some advice on live video processing for a hobby project I&#x27;m working on.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on placing a live camera on a beach. My current setup leaves a lot to be desired, but my main problem has been with video-processing-related stuff which I have had no contact with as a developer until now.<p>It consists of a camera-equipped microcontroller connected to WiFi that is constantly sending JPEGs to a server through HTTP POST requests. On the server side, these JPEGs get saved as files in a folder which in turn are converted to an RTMP live video feed - using ffmpeg - which gets sent to a streaming platform (Twitch or Youtube).<p>There are problems with my current approach mainly that ffmpeg &quot;finishes&quot; converting my JPEGs mid &quot;transmission&quot; (I use quotes here because all that means is that my microcontroller is still sending JPEGs to the server).<p>I searched extensively but I&#x27;ve had trouble formulating the queries given how specific my use-case seems to be, and have had little success in this regard. That leads me into believing that I&#x27;m commiting mistakes in my approach to this project - which is of no surprise, given my lack of experience in video, specially streaming.<p>So I&#x27;d like some pointers or suggestions from you - it could be pointed at any part of the process I&#x27;m currently doing, though what made me write this in the first place was the video streaming problems I&#x27;m facing. It could be general resources into encoders, decoders, transcoders, video in general... Or even just comment what you&#x27;d change to make streaming work.<p>Perhaps as a way of being more direct: how does can &quot;generic&quot; - as in normal practice - livestreaming be achieved without the help of something like OBS?<p>Thank you.",
