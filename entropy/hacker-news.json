      "text": "I&#x27;m trying to find a calculator as good as my old Texas Instrument TI-89. I liked it so much that I continued to use it for many years on my smartphone with an emulator from F-Droid, also by laziness to find something better and more modern.<p>But I recently switched from Android to iOS and you can&#x27;t find a TI-89 emulator on iOS. You have a few web based online but they are not very nice to use.<p>I got the WolframAlpha app as it is often recommended, but it is super slow and cloud based. And you need to reformulate some queries a lot before it does what you want. However, the Apple app store is full of calculators that all look relatively nice. I havn&#x27;t found yet one as powerful as the old TI 89 or the Voyage 200, but I guess it does exist.<p>The closest modern match I found so far is the Numworks emulator app, but it&#x27;s not as nice.<p>So what&#x27;s your favourite calculator ? You may prefer GNU bc in a shell, or a mechanical calculator.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudflare.f-droid.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;packages&#x2F;com.Bisha.TI89EmuDonation&#x2F;\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.numworks.com",
