What is happenning right now is a disaster.<p>That said, the more I read about the events, the more I am confused about the real motivations and reasons for the decisions made these days.<p>One thing is clear to me: both sides of the conflict actively use propaganda, fake news and other dirty methods to nudge people in doubt in the right direction.<p>I have no reason to favor either side, but I would definitely like to understand the situtation better.<p>One thing I find a bit strange is that there is so much focus on Putin&#x27;s actions now with huge support from Europe, but I don&#x27;t remember seeing this level of solidarity back when the US did similar things (in my opinion at least). Isn&#x27;t that a sign of double standards depending on the country?<p>There is also one common point made by the supporters of Russia: why weren&#x27;t European states interested in the war occurring in Donetsk and Lugansk starting from 2014?<p>I do agree that even that is no justification to military interventions, but isn&#x27;t that question valid to ask?<p>My view (one more time, I am not a specialist so I might be wrong) is that all the participants of the conflict only pursue their strategic interests and no one really cares about the Ukrainians (which is really sad).<p>Anyway, probably you know some articles that at least try to shed light on what is really going on without putting obvious labels in the first sentence? I mean, some articles I have seen so far call Putin an aggressor right in the title and then there is only one side considered.<p>Thanks!",
