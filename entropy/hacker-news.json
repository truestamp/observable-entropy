      "text": "The WWW was built to transport hypertext documents, which became interactive thanks to JavaScript. Since HTML5, increasingly complex webapps are being built, and daily on HN people complain about Electron &amp; bloated frontend tech.<p>I think the web grew naturally to dominance, and in the process lots of work went into optimizing JS performance and building browsers into the huge runtime environments they are today.<p>My question is, what would it take to build a new web that aims to support highly interactive applications from the start? Something that provides a unified runtime across different platforms, loads lazily &#x2F; needs no installs, and uses a more performant language with fewer pitfalls than JS. Bonus points if it is as open to user-side modifications as the current web.<p>I have a feeling that I just described Flutter; please share if something like this is being worked on.",
