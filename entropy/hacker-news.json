      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I am leading the engineering team for six months now. \nThe company started post-pandemic, and the team has remained remote forever. The majority of the team members consist of fresh graduates.<p>Everything was running smoothly, and we hit an ARR of $1m on Mar 21.<p>With initial success, we doubled down and started increasing our team from 6 members to 20 members. It was when things started to go haywire.<p>Planning related<p>- Planned feature launches are getting delayed due to different reasons one by one.<p>- Everyone is DMing or sending a message on chats to get things done, causing untracked requests and added anxiety to developers.<p>- Unlimited iterations between CEO, technical, communication, and sales team.<p>- Debriefing the technical stack and getting developers onboarded is continuous trouble-causing offloading to newer members impossible.<p>Team issues<p>- Few colleagues feel they are not aware of the vision (documented in the wiki).<p>- Old team members are divided into groups and work in silos (technical, sales, operations, etc.), causing an environment of mistrust, no collaboration, etc.<p>- Degradation of product quality over time.<p>We have tried roadmap planning, standups, sprints, and CEO town halls to overcome a few difficulties.<p>I have an intrinsic feeling this might be more common in industry than we acknowledge. Unfortunately, I am lacking access to resources that can help in identifying clear patterns&#x2F;reasons.<p>What will be your suggestion on tackling these non-technical troubles?",
