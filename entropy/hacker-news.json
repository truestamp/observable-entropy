Share a screenshot and explain the details of your scripts&#x2F;styles&#x2F;changes.<p>---<p>I&#x27;ll start. My HN: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;z9D2XPr.png<p>I use Stylebot to implement custom CSS rules. I tried many dark HN extensions and most of them have issues with threading or style details I didn&#x27;t like, so I just wrote my own CSS.<p>Then I use Tampermonkey to run a simple JS function which adds tags based on how many comments each article has. And I also tag articles as &quot;Fresh&quot; if they have been posted within the last hour.<p>I also plan to add sorting by comment count. The thing I loved most about HN is the discussions that happen within the comments.",
