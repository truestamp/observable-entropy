We&#x27;ve been working on this browser extension with a friend for the last three years and we&#x27;ve made a few updates recently, so I figured I&#x27;d post it here :)<p>We&#x27;re building it as an open source and more modern alternative to things like Momentum. There&#x27;s still a ton more we&#x27;d like to do and we&#x27;re looking for constructive criticism or advice, both to improve it and make more people know about it.<p>We&#x27;re really proud of it and hope you like it. Cheers!",
