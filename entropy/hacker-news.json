      "text": "We&#x27;re a paying customer of Atlassian -- using Jira, Confluence and some other tools. Today I&#x27;ve received an email from them that says:<p>&quot;Now that you manage accounts for &lt;organisation&gt;, you can find out how many products your users administer outside your organization.<p>For details about each product and admin contact information, subscribe to Atlassian Access. Use these details to stay ahead of where company data is stored and start a discussion about transferring the products to your organization.&quot;<p>Apparently Atlassian wants us to pay a few $ extra per user per month so that they tell us what other Atlassian products have our own users activated.<p>I think it&#x27;s fine to charge extra for complex&#x2F;sophisticated features that are mostly useful to large enterprises. However, telling SMBs that there&#x27;s a &#x27;shadow IT&#x27; in the company that Atlassian knows about but won&#x27;t disclose the details until the customer pays up feels wrong to me. Same applies to features like &#x27;mandatory 2FA&#x27; that&#x27;s not part of the &#x27;normal&#x27; subscription.",
