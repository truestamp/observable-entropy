      "text": "You pay $5 to get unlimited posts (throttled to 1kb &#x2F; sec). No ads. No selling of user data. Just a free and open API (for users) with a basic (fully-modifiable) web UI. No censorship (except for laws enforced by hosting country).<p>To make it possible, it&#x27;d have to be a MVP - just basic twitter functionality with all posts stored in memory and accessible for only a few days. Just basic, high-performance, low-latency micro-blogging with an extendable API. Everything else would be outsourced to the community: search, direct messaging, analytics, history, advanced functionality, etc.<p>It would be like a centralized mastodon, but with a b-corporation type structure.",
