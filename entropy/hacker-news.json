The course is intended to help anyone who knows Python and a bit of math go from the very basics all the way to today&#x27;s mainstream models and frameworks.<p>I strive to balance theory and practice and so every module consists of detailed explanations and slides along with a Colab notebook (in most modules) putting the theory into practice.<p>In part one, we cover text preprocessing, how to turn text into numbers, and multiple ways to classify and search text using &quot;classical&quot; approaches. And along the way, we&#x27;ll pick up useful bits on how to use tools such as spaCy and scikit-learn.<p>No registration required: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlpdemystified.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nlpdemystified.org&#x2F;</a>",
