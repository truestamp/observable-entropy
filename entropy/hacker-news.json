It makes everything easy.<p>Now I have added authentication using Supabase, so you can login through Google oAuth or a magic link which allows you to have multiple pads and control if they are publicly viewable &#x2F; editable or not.<p>Since Supabase doesn&#x27;t have anon authentication, it is better to use rpc functions instead of adding policies. That way be default row level security blocks everything and rpc functions control who has access. That way I can prevent &quot;select *&quot; queries.",
