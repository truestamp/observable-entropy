      "text": "Hello everybody,<p>Out of fun, I made a job board, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pacificdevs.com, dedicated to the IT sector in AUS&#x2F;NZ. Primarily I did this project to improve my skills and I was wondering if there is something I could improve. So far it features:<p>- Filters to search by tags, location, visa sponsorship, remote, etc.\n- Companies can post job offers with a description, tech stack as well as benefits (work from home, pet friendly office, Friday beers, etc).\n- Developers can create profiles (add a small bio and upload their skills) so companies can find them, too.\n- If logged-in, you can filter by recommendations.\n- Dark mode.<p>Very much looking forward!",
