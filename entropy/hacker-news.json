I&#x27;m getting rather serious about my side project and can&#x27;t really give up at any point. I am only however, willing to launch my product when it shows some promise. To keep the ball rolling, I&#x27;m currently in a situation where I can&#x27;t let go of my full-time job yet.<p>I know people slowly Transition from an employee to an entrepreneur, but with a family and kids, I wanted to know every piece of valuable information to extract the most of my busy life as much as I can. My wife works on a full-time job that pays well, for what It&#x27;s worth.<p>Answers and help appreciated!",
