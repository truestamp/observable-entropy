      "text": "Hello HN!<p>What&#x27;s the minimal thing to build before reaching out to potential customers to validate the need for a new product idea?<p>I&#x27;m a solo founder working on a new SaaS product idea. I am tempted to just build the product, but I know this isn&#x27;t recommended until the need is verified with customers. So far I have cold emailed some (~10) potential customers and am met with silence.<p>I am considering between building a landing page, demo video or a prototype as a next step. As a parent with a full-time job, I do not get to spend a ton of time on this project. So I need to be careful about my time investment.<p>Any B2B founders willing to share their experience on how they went about getting their first customer? What did you already build before reaching out to first potential customers?<p>Much appreciated!",
