      "text": "Everyone knows that programmers tend to have strong opinions about minor technical details. Silicon Valley enshrined this with tabs vs. spaces. But Emacs vs. Vim is older.  For me, my personal pet peeve is in curly braced code not having braces around single statements. Compare:<p>No brace<p>if(x) doStuff(x);<p>Versus<p>if(x){\n    doStuff(x);\n}<p>One objective point in my favor is that you avoid issues with misleading indentation and a few cases that have caused CVE&#x27;s.   Not in my favor, the first is shorter. And people often believe code density is a virtue.<p>I never really thought about this a being a huge issue, until recently I had an interviewee express a strong preference for no braces, and I thought it was absurd to feel so strongly, and secondarily I thought they were wrong.<p>Anyone else have strong feelings either way that want to express themselves?",
