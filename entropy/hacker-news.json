      "text": "These days, it seems anything of scale (and indeed, just about anything in general) lives in &quot;the cloud&quot;.\nFor commercial and other projects with some incentive for income, this is probable fine(tm).<p>But for lots of open source things, we couldn&#x27;t scale even if we wanted to, due to hosting costs.\nImagine an open non-profit version of Instagram as an example, they spent what, $3 billion  on AWS.<p>Peer to peer seems such an obvious solution to this, but somehow, it&#x27;s failed to materialize as a widely employed technology.\nWhen I first heard of peertube, I thought &quot;Finally! Someone is doing what must be a mix of Kazaa and youtube, where the videos are hosted by all the online computers&quot; and boy was I dissapointed.<p>So, in short, why do you think we&#x27;re not seeing p2p being widely deployed as an alternative to traditional hosting?",
