      "text": "Honest question<p>I know Putin likely has plans beyond eastern Ukraine.<p>But in Western media there seems to be no possibility of Donbas being more suited to Russia alignment. (which actually might be right, based on my very limited understanding)<p>I know that&#x27;s a RIDICULOUS statement.  Why should any country ever give way to violence just because parts of it might be more suited to another?<p>But the alternative is freaking war, and it&#x27;s looking very scary.<p>Have we just ruled out too soon a possibility of Russia stopping at Donbas?<p>But similarly, I have no idea why Putin would care so much about just Donbas, enough to inflict sanctions on himself and ruin his gas export plans.  I don&#x27;t believe for one second he cares for the people of Donbas to that extent. So again there is more going on than what I can understand from our media.",
