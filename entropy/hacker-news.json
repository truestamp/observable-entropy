      "text": "Wondering if there&#x27;s good advice around for this. I work for a pretty small startup (Series A, ~50 employees). I&#x27;m a mid-level manager, so not on the executive team, but interact with that team pretty heavily.<p>Over the past couple months, it has become very clear that there is a culture of distrust and conflict within the company, and a lot of that feeds out of leadership relations with our CEO. The CEO is fairly egotistical - assumes they can do everyone&#x27;s job better, and employs verbal abuse to make that clear. Whenever they get a scent of something going wrong in the company they will swoop in and criticize the people involved, give some off-the-cuff opinions on how they&#x27;d do it better, and then disappear to the next tirade before anything is actually fixed.<p>This has led to most of the company tip-toeing around the CEO and trying to just do work without pulling CEO attention. New projects and initiatives usually have a discussion topic around how to NOT get the CEO involved, or how to keep it minimal if necessary. There&#x27;s back-channel talk all over Slack complaining about the CEO&#x27;s most recent whatever.<p>The easy route here would just be to keep my head down and probably start looking for a new job... but is there a better way? Leaving this problem unaddressed probably means the company will eventually implode - what&#x27;s the best way to get ahead of a problem that is sourced at the very top of the company?",
