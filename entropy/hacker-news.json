      "text": "We&#x27;ve had some success selling our enterprise product (based off an open core), but we wonder if by having a list of 10-20 modules for customers is too complicated.<p>I know that if we were selling to consumers, we would want to limit choice, but enterprise is a longer sales process and customization seems like a benefit.<p>Has anyone taken their long list of modules and converted them to a bundle model? Or vice versa?<p>I have a feeling that if we did offer bundles, we&#x27;d get customers asking us to drop this or that module and cut them a deal anyway.<p>But maybe a bundle is a better jumping-off point for that sales discussion?<p>Thanks!",
