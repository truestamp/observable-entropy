      "text": "Amidst all of the hysteria around the Valieva affair I was interested in watching a clip that NBC Sports had posted on their Youtube channel of Valieva landing the first ever quad jump in Olympic competition, which supposedly is a seminal event in figure skating history. I remember having watched it but for the life of my could not find it again.<p>I did a search in my history and sure enough, NBC has made the video private:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hda3vvmqQHQ\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20220207105125&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hda3vvmqQHQ&amp;t=198s<p>I find it incredible that they&#x27;ve removed this video from public consumption. The event happened, the coverage of the event happened, what could possibly justify removing the video, regardless of any proceeding events?",

      "text": "Hi, \nI&#x27;m planning to build a Laravel package that allow you to import data from a spreadsheet to your application. Available UI components: React, Vue 2 &#x2F; 3, Livewire, and Blade components.<p>The problem:\nEvery time you need to build this functionality from scratch, it takes a lot of time and effort to create the API that can have columns validation, file format, handle large import files (e.g. 1 million rows), and makes UI that can provide the best end user experience.<p>The solution:\nA Laravel package with great, tested and documented API togheter with UI Livewire and Blade components. A npm packages to provides UI for React, Vue 2&#x2F;3.<p>* Ease and flexibile integration in any Laravel&#x2F;React&#x2F;Vue projects.\n* Define columns with their validation rules\n* Support format: xls, .xlsx, .ods, and .csv and Google Sheets Integration.\n* Templates of imports.\n* Styles customization. Will use Tailwind CSS.\n* Listen for events: Import started, Import ended.\n* Send notifications to the user when import is ready.<p>There is a concept, it&#x27;s just the first vision as I see how it has to be:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;JPveTY--rss<p>I was inspired from this product: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layercode.com, another example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatfile.com. But I consider that as a Web Artisan I can have this directly in my application and even cheaper than paying a monthly subscription.<p>I&#x27;m thinking to make it as a software license, one-time payment with one year updates, as Spatie.be do.<p>What to you think? Will be useful for you?",
