As someone who&#x27;s still in academia (grad school), what do you think I should do?  I feel like I owe myself a lot, and even though I&#x27;m in a relationship now, I can&#x27;t stop thinking about the opportunities that I missed with girls when I was younger.  I also think about dropping out of the PhD program and transitioning to the industry, maybe because I feel like I&#x27;ll never be appreciated in academia and maybe because I feel like I need a new beginning.",
