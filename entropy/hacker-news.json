      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for a single player game that runs natively on Steam Linux without any extra packages needed. I don&#x27;t want to have to install or configure anything extra.<p>FWIW, I have a relatively high spec machine (Nvidia 2070, lots of RAM, etc.), so I&#x27;m not too concerned about system requirements.<p>When I go to explore Linux games on Steam, the list is quite long. I inevitably go down deep rabbit holes of reading player reviews trying to find the right game, until I run out of steam.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate your suggestions (despite my terrible pun above), and if you don&#x27;t mind, please also share your reasons.<p>Thanks!",
