      "text": "Hi! Is it still worth it to switch companies every few years if ur already high paid? This is not meant to be a humble brag or anything but I just started outa college and make 180k and if I get a promo to ic4, I’ll basically get a 33% pay bump and then to ic5 is another pay bump. My mentors&#x2F; friends all say to get to ic5 is just a matter of time as long as ur competent. I hear people say u should be switching jobs every 2 to 4 years and what not but wouldn’t that make me lose all the “political” capital within the team and org and delay promo?",
