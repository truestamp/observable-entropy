      "text": "I&#x27;ve been tried Linux Mint for more than a year after using Windows 7, and now I&#x27;m considering switching back.<p>I have good hardware: Ryzen 3900x, 32Gb RAM, SSD.<p>These are some of the bugs:\n1. Mouse gets stuck in the drag mode once in a while (tested in Ubuntu &#x2F; Mint &#x2F; Wayland &#x2F; Xorg). Perhaps this is the bug, it exists since 2009 and it&#x27;s not getting any traction: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.launchpad.net&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F;+source&#x2F;rapidsvn&#x2F;+bug&#x2F;402892\n2. Nemo sometimes simply crashed.\n3. There were times when the system just logged out or failed to resume from suspend.\n4. Recently the sound system started failing after suspend, and then it&#x27;s impossible (or takes half an hour) to shutdown the PC without holding the power button.<p>These are not even Nvidia related bugs, it&#x27;s just the core functionality of Linux acting up and not getting fixed.<p>Like why would that mouse behavior not be addressed? I&#x27;ve seen many people talking about it.<p>Then Linux Mint developers for some reason put Ctrl-Alt-Backspace shortcut into startup applications, while Ubuntu disabled this shortcut (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.ubuntu.com&#x2F;XorgCtrlAltBackspace), which resulted in me constantly being logged out and it took months to find out the cause (restarting the X server).<p>Today after booting up I couldn&#x27;t switch the keyboard layout, the shortcut simply didn&#x27;t do anything.<p>On the other (older) computers where I tried Linux, the system wouldn&#x27;t shut down correctly or had multiple other bugs, while Windows 7 worked stably.<p>Before switching to Linux, I had been using a Windows 7 computer for several years on much older hardware and mostly didn&#x27;t have any issues. I didn&#x27;t receive any system updates (only once probably), the system didn&#x27;t crash unexpectedly, the mouse &#x2F; tablet &#x2F; touchscreen worked fine. The sound worked fine. I didn&#x27;t have to troubleshoot constant problems, searching the Internet for hours. I could just use it.<p>But I could be ok with these bugs, I could just reinstall Linux and try to not upgrade and so I would probably not face most of the bugs. But this issue with the mouse getting stuck in the drag mode is probably going to be the last straw for me to switch back to Windows, unless Linux devs finally look at this issue:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.launchpad.net&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F;+source&#x2F;rapidsvn&#x2F;+bug&#x2F;402892 (exists since 2009)\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.launchpad.net&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F;+bug&#x2F;1961034 (is probably a duplicate of the previous one)",
