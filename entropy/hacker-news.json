      "text": "Yesterday my son (will be 9-year old in a couple of months) asked if I can teach him to code. Although I am a software engineer, I never thought about that.<p>My question is: If I do, what language should I teach my son at first? Currently I&#x27;m mostly familiar with Rust, and a little Python. I used to write C for 10 years and Java for 3 years. I also use Objective-C. I think, as common sense, I should use the language I am mostly familiar with (Rust), but I doubt that&#x27;s a good idea for 9-year old.",
