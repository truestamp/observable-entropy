      "text": "I struggle a bit with depression and anxiety. The last couple years I have had to drop out due to these issues. I was wondering if are there any CS Programs in the USA which have a great disability office or general student support. \nSo far I looked into Western Governors University. Supposedly it has a self paced program which I think might find helpful. I also looked at Oregon State University&#x27;s program it was rated well on college rating sites and they offer counseling and life coaching for students.\nWould you have any suggestions?",
