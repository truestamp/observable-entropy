      "text": "After 20+ years, I&#x27;ve recently come to the conclusion that I don&#x27;t want to be in &quot;IT&quot; anymore. It is all I&#x27;ve ever done (sysadmin, dev, security), but I just don&#x27;t enjoy it anymore. I&#x27;ve started to look around at other options, but as you would expect, the pay for non-tech roles is way lower than what I have grown accustomed to. I am looking to pay off all my debt before switching careers, but I still have a family to support, so unfortunately, pay rate still matters.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear what other folks have done in similar situations. Were  you able to find something comparable? Do I just need to accept that I&#x27;ll never make near what I currently make outside of tech? Do you feel you made the right choice?<p>TIA",
