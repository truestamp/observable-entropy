The bot isn’t mine, yet it used my inclusive language repository.<p>The discussion raised good questions. I&#x27;ve written some answers that explain why you should care: inclusive language is better for teamwork, easier for programming, smarter for defaults, and critical for many kinds of collaboration.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joelparkerhenderson&#x2F;gender-inclusive-language&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;doc&#x2F;questions-and-answers.md<p>Constructive feedback welcome.",
