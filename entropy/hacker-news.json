      "text": "A few months ago I posted an online dice rolling application for a tabletop miniature game that I play.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actasf.netlify.app<p>It is just a quick app that I put together with JQuery and Bootstrap. It isn&#x27;t finished and I posted it to netlify to get some feedback from users. It is a test version. The game is fun but I find the hit and damage process to be a bit tedious so I wrote this app to make it simpler.<p>While it was being developed I posted some screenshots of it and had the company that produces the game, Amarillo Design Bureau, tell me that it violated their copyrights.<p>I asked for specific references to the material and what copyrights it violated but never got a response. AFAICT there is no copyright protection for names and numbers. I searched the trademark database t make sure that I wasn&#x27;t inadvertently referencing a trademark.<p>The company is a small &#x27;mom and pop&#x27; operation (well just pop now as mom retired) and so I made sure that I wasn&#x27;t adding anything to the app that would make it possible to play the game without having a copy of the rules.<p>Today they sent a DMCA takedown threat to me. I reiterated by belief that none of the material on the site is covered by any copyright or other intellectual property rights and again asked for specifics of the supposed violations.<p>Am I correct that the material I am using is not covered by copyright? It is just numbers and names from a game.",
