      "text": "A bit of an odd request, but I have weird Android issue with an autolinked TextView and came a couple of months ago across a (I believe) StackOverflow discussion where that precise issue was discussed. While I am not sure there was a definitive fix, it was at least being discussed. Unfortunately, regardless of which search terms I use, I can&#x27;t find it any more.<p>The issue is when you have more than one autolinked TextView with different links, only every odd &quot;click&quot; will open the actual link. Every even &quot;click&quot; will open the previously opened URL. I click TextView A and go to example.com. Then TextView B for cern.ch, but instead it still goes to example.com. Only when I click TextView B again, it goes to the actual URL.<p>It almost seems the StackOverflow posting disappeared or I simply don&#x27;t remember what I search for :)",
