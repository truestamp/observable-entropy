      "text": "Were licenses violated (intentionally or otherwise) in the released Copilot model? I have seen lots of comments in which people would answer &quot;yes&quot; to this question. What is the official stance? Does Github do anything to mitigate license abuse? How is Github giving attribution where due?<p>Currently this feels as though after many years Microsoft &#x2F; Github stabbed its users in the back by violating our licenses.<p>If open source licenses were violated only for Github to sell our laundered code back to us for $100 a year, what is the point in contributing to open source software? This feels like a massive scam.<p>Many years ago I became concerned that the various websites that constantly ask for free code contributions and solutions (hackerrank, stackoverflow etc) might be building AI based on that code. of course my coworkers laughed (coincidentally one went on to work at github, i wonder if he remembers our conversation) and here we are.",
