In fact, the text pattern I wrote was quite similar to previous launches (Dropbox, WebFlow, etc.).<p>If someone does not like a startup, why should he flag it? Instead of leaving a comment!<p>Or do I have to collect a certain number of points before publishing?<p>After more than ten years of following YC and the startup school and reading PG blogs about startups and stories about lunching in HN .... It was really disappointing.<p>Samples:\nMy YC app: Dropbox - Throw away your USB drive (YC S07)\nShow HN: Codecademy.com, the easiest way to learn to code\n (YC S11)\nShow HN: Firebase, a scalable real-time backend\n (YC S11)\nShow HN: Webflow - Design responsive websites visually\n (YC S13)<p>My Post:\n[flagged] Show HN: Build, manage, and scale your ecommerce visually (selldone.com)",
