It took some matrix problem, solved it naively, and then applied different optimizations such as branchless coding, simd, openmp, compiler optimizations, etc. It showed the cumulative effect of each optimization, and I though it was amazing. Unfortunately, I lost the link to this website and cannot find it despite hours of Googling and searching on HN and Reddit directly.<p>Wondering if anybody here knows resources that were useful for similar or different topics, or might be able to provide a link to what I lost.",
