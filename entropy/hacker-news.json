      "text": "I&#x27;m a Chemist that has been self-teaching programming for about 2 years now. I&#x27;m full committing to switching careers now, and I&#x27;m based in Ontario, Canada. I had an interview in March through a connection I made in the C++ community but the company decided to go with someone else. Also too I just had an interview for an internship at a startup but I failed one of the technical questions (It was based on a doubly linked binary tree). Hence I&#x27;ve started doing a leetcode question a day, since it&#x27;s clearly something I need to work on.<p>Is there any more I can do to improve my chances of getting interviews, or getting through them? I&#x27;m also having my friend mock interview me every now and then just so I&#x27;m fully prepared for next time. I&#x27;ve been doing what the person in the thread below did but I&#x27;ve only gotten 2&#x2F;30 responses so far lol...<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;cscareerquestions&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ogc2kj&#x2F;just_landed_first_junior_software_development&#x2F;<p>I have a few projects on my GitHub (GitHub.com&#x2F;Karsteski) but with practicing Leetcode and doing job searching, I barely have time to work on my current project, which is an OpenGL rendering engine. Makes me sad.<p>Anyways, here&#x27;s my anonymous resume as well if you&#x27;d like to critique it.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1S9lMyo<p>Any feedback welcome, thanks in advance :)",
