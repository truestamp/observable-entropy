I can&#x27;t believe business can operate like this. I&#x27;m currently trying to rebuild a critical PC as it freezes up all the time. Debugging the issue is a nightmare.<p>Our servers regularly stop working, some interaction between active directory and DNS. I haven&#x27;t been able to get to the bottom of it. Every second Sunday the server requires a reboot else the entire network doesn&#x27;t seem to work.<p>This didn&#x27;t happen with Linux things just worked or you knew why they didn&#x27;t.<p>Is my experience typical or just bad luck?",
