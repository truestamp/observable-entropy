      "text": "Long-time Google Fi user. For the past two years I&#x27;ve been traveling a lot but spending some time in US, which has usually worked pretty well with Google Fi. I moved to the UK in January for an 11-month stay. I have now been served this e-mail from Google Fi:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nAs a reminder, Fi&#x27;s Terms of Service require you to use our service primarily in the United States (territories not included), and it looks like you&#x27;ve been predominantly using Fi abroad. In 30 days, we&#x27;ll need to suspend your international roaming data capabilities unless you start using Fi in the United States again (territories not included). Your calls and texts will not be impacted.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>I am not going back to the states until November. But I NEED to keep my US number for work purposes. My constant back-and-forth before Google Fi has caused me to completely miss out on good business in the past, and I thought Google Fi was the answer to this.<p>Does anyone know of any alternatives? I would like to keep my US number without paying whatever insane rent-seeking fee Verizon&#x2F;ATT will impose for being out of the country for so long. If I give in and get a UK SIM, can I keep my US number on WhatsApp and Signal? Who governs the assignment of numbers?",
