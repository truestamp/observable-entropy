      "text": "On Saturday, Yuga Labs and the Bored Ape Yacht Club had a metaverse land sale. They sold $300M+ worth of land during their drop.<p>The craziest part was 55.6k ETH (~$150M) of ETH was burned because of transaction fees.  \nAt its peak, ETH gas costs hit 2ETH ($6,000), which is what the french call le ridiculous.\nEvery single time a transaction happens on the Ethereum network there is a fee, some of it gets “burned” and taken out of the total supply of ETH. On a normal day, we burn ~$30M of supply. But for this drop, 5x that got burned.<p>They are trying to quadruple dip: \nDip 1: Sell an NFT (Bored Apes)\nDip 2: Create a coin (Apecoin)\nDip 3: Sell virtual land for a metaverse that doesn’t exist yet  \nDip 4: Okay, you’ve run out of tokens to launch. So now launch your own blockchain<p>They have raised the stakes. Now, this can only go 2 ways: \nThis becomes a generational company…they end up creating some mix between Pokemon and Fortnite\nOr (more likely) the whole Bored Apes craze comes crashing down in a few years and we look back at this moment as the peak of NFT project greed",

      "text": "What are some mathematics books that made you so fascinated about the subject that you became curious and started learning more and ultimately became a student of mathematics directly or indirectly?<p>The books got you from understanding mathematics as rote arithmetic calculations to what mathematics really is about. Of course the books were themselves good teachers due to their excellent exposition and carefully set exercise problems (maybe with solutions).<p>Btw, I am not talking only about pure mathematics.<p>Do you have a few such books?",
