      "text": "I&#x27;m curious how others store their photos. Right now:<p>- I use Arq to back up to an AWS Glacier instance\n- I use CarbonCopyCloner to clone to two external drives\n- I also back up to Shutterfly... though Shutterfly just shut down their desktop uploader so now I need a new solution<p>Problems:<p>0. I&#x27;m using a ton of local HD space to store them. I want to free up a bunch of space.<p>1. If I delete photos from my computer, Arq will eventually delete the backups that contained them. Could be months or years but if they&#x27;re not local, they&#x27;ll be gone when the cost to store them exceeds the monthly budget I&#x27;ve set with Arq.<p>I think this is what a good storage situation looks like:<p>1. Photos are retained forever in the cloud even if they&#x27;re deleted from my devices. I have to go to cloud storage to explicitly delete something.  Deleting something accidentally should never ever happen.<p>2. Photos and videos are automatically backed up to the cloud from my iphone and desktop<p>3. The UI for browsing cloud photos is fast and nice<p>4. I don&#x27;t want to use a company with a poor history of user privacy e.g. Google&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;FB.  I&#x27;m happy to pay for the service.<p>5. Bonus if my wife can connect her phone to the same cloud account as mine<p>6. Very nice to have: photos are encrypted locally before getting sent to the cloud like with Arq.<p>What do you use? Have you solved any of the problems I&#x27;ve laid out above?",
