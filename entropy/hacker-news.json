Let them trust you because the words are their own.<p>2&#x2F; Focus on benefits<p>Emphasise the benefit to the reader, not features.<p>Eugene Schwartz said, “Talk about what your product ‘does’, not ‘is’ - and demonstrate this.”<p>3&#x2F; Less is more<p>Give a clear, concise message, nothing more.<p>“Write to the chimpanzee brain - simply and directly.” - Eugene Schwartz<p>4&#x2F; Get their heads nodding<p>Ask questions in your copy that get your reader answering yes.<p>If they say yes once, they’re likely to say it again, and again, and again.<p>Once their heads are nodding, they’re hooked.<p>5&#x2F; Appeal to emotion.<p>What is your reader’s deepest desire? If you can capitalise on that, you’ll have a valuable customer.<p>The strongest, deepest emotions, not governed by rational thought, are:<p>- Greed\n- Guilt\n- Exclusivity\n- Fear\n- Anger\n- Salvation\n- Flattery<p>6&#x2F; Avoid ’weasel words’<p>Fill your audience with confidence, not doubt. Avoiding commanding words is a way to protect yourself, your reader will recognise that.<p>Replace may, hope, could, with will, can, do.<p>7&#x2F; You, You, We<p>Use the word ‘you’ at least twice as much as ‘we’.<p>If you speak about your prospect, you’ll naturally focus on their needs.<p>8&#x2F; Make it look good<p>Don’t waste well-written copy with poor aesthetic.<p>Make it appealing.\n- Short paragraphs\n- Variety in the text (italicising, bullet points, headings)\n- Images and vibrant colours<p>9&#x2F; Use numbers<p>Numbers drive credibility.<p>Confidence isn’t enough to win over skeptics; give them reliable data.<p>10&#x2F; Focus on one point<p>If you have something important to say, say it over and over again.<p>Richard Perry says, “Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time—a tremendous whack.”<p>11&#x2F; Relax.<p>Successful copy is personal and relaxed.<p>Don’t bother with formal language - just imagine you’re having a one-on-one conversation with your reader.<p>12&#x2F; Tell a story<p>Stories make you memorable.<p>13&#x2F; Snowball your reader<p>Every sentence should lead into the next.<p>And the next,<p>And the next.<p>Turn your copy into a snowball.<p>14&#x2F; Be funny<p>Nothing is more personal than humour.<p>You don’t need your reader in stitches - just let them know you’re a real person too.<p>-- \nYou made it!<p>Hopefully it was helpful. I originally wrote an extended version for the newsletter of a new project I&#x27;m working on.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in getting more marketing tips and tricks, check out upskillmarketing.org<p>Cheers,\nConnor.",
