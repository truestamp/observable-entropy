      "text": "For what it’s worth I would hazard to guess that Putins war aims are limited. Reading some respectable analysts who think he intends to conquer the whole country.<p>Can’t be sure they are wrong but putins flirtations with war were mostly focused on limited war. My guess is the same holds true here and he will declare victory when the ukraine army in the donbas surrenders plus some opportunistic gains elsewhere as the fortunes of the conflict allow.<p>His peace terms i expect will be very imposing. Perhaps full ukraine air overflight. Or concession of some important road junctures. Or dismissal of small, all of the the ukraine gov cabinet. What is your estimate of this ? If you agree with the above, do you think zelensky would acquiesce to this ?",
