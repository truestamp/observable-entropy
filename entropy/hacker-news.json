      "text": "I&#x27;m changing email from Gmail to Fastmail, so today I decide to update my PayPal email address.  When I signed in, they want me to enter a mobile phone number.  I don&#x27;t really want to do that, so give them the Indiana toll-free directory assistance number.  I know, I know, it&#x27;s my fault, too bad.<p>The next screen is &quot;We&#x27;ve sent a code to your number, what&#x27;s the code?&quot;  There is a small &quot;Change&quot; link next to the phone number, so I click that.  Nothing.<p>I can&#x27;t login because I can&#x27;t confirm the bogus phone number.<p>I can change my password, but that still doesn&#x27;t let me login.<p>I can call PayPal customer service, but they ask if you have an account (yes), they ask for the phone number.  They won&#x27;t accept &quot;None&quot; as an answer.  I give them the bogus number and they say &quot;We&#x27;ve sent a code to that number, what is it?&quot;<p>So if you lose access to your phone, you lose access to your PayPal account.  I called eBay, got a support rep, and he told me the same thing happened to him.  He handled it by reporting a security violation - you can do that w&#x2F;o a phone number or logging in.  So I reported a hate crime, then described my actual problem.  Sheesh!<p>There are posts on the PayPal community forum from people who have been trying to fix this for months.",
