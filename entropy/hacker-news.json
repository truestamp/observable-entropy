      "text": "As a blacksmith I made a physical coin for a village. The coin told the story how the people from the village got their freedom from the centralised Kingdom, here in Spain in 1583.<p>With the coin I created, people could buy with it on the stores. Tourists bought it as a rememberance. Ended up making thousands.<p>People sent me photos from the coin around the world.<p>Now, I&#x27;m thinking in making NFTs collection of the photos from the coin around the world and a token with a total supply of the price they paid for their freedom (1.219.512)<p>Is it worthy? Appreciate your comments.",

      "text": "Hi there,<p>we launched capacities.io - your second brain. It&#x27;s a new note-taking app that solves your problem of organizing all the information you consume every day and turns it to a valuable and growing asset.<p>In short:<p>- Capture ideas when you have them: Just send a message to capacities from your favorite messenger and it will be saved to your second brain.<p>- Organized by type: Don&#x27;t create faceless pages but define meetings, ideas, questions, or books. Adapt your note-taking to your context and your thinking.<p>- Say goodbye to folders: An intuitive approach to networked thinking. Don&#x27;t think about the folder your note should die in before you even start writing. Just start and connect it to all related ideas over time. You will create a highly connected second brain that stays valuable even if you add thousands of notes.<p>Feel free to try it out, it’s free. Just sign up at capacities.io<p>And of course we’d love to get your feedback, just reach out at team@capacities.io.",
