      "text": "I&#x27;ve seen posts about people posting what they were doing about the bar being so low in tech. So I decided to post my own affairs.<p>I currently have 50 roles in tech; what I am doing is essentially outsourcing the labor to India, Poland, Nigeria, and Argentina. I am, basically, running an outsourcing company at this stage and have people process and handle requests in those countries and assign engineers. I learned a ton about quality control and am making 7.5M a year. I am able to juggle the work because most of my gigs are in startups and meetings rarely happen so i&#x27;m pretty much running on autopilot.",
