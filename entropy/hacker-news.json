      "text": "I work as a software architect in a Fortune 500 company.\nAccording to some people I know from the outside, I&#x27;m introverted and &quot;too modest&quot; .\nThere are 80 developers and 6 software architects.<p>I usually find some really nice technologies and ways to improve our system and most of the time, \nthings work as I expected. Plus, whenever there is a bug nobody knows how to deal with, I&#x27;m the one they call.<p>The thing is there are some architects who sometimes challenge my ideas and even refute them. \nI&#x27;m Ok with that.\nBut the worst and that&#x27;s what makes me sick is that when I&#x27;m spot on, those same architects who refute my ideas, \ncopy&#x2F;paste my solutions and even sometimes evangelise them to other It departments in my company.<p><i>Question</i> : how do you deal with people appropriating your ideas in a company (especially after they publicly criticised them ) ?\n(PS: I&#x27;m not saying &quot;I&#x27;m the best&quot; and &quot;they are all wrong&quot;. I&#x27;m just describing what sometimes happens).",
