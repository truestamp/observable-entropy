      "text": "Hi<p>Having to create websites and apps for customers from time to time I wanted a tool that would simplify the task of deciding upon the design of the future product. The whole design process is definitely complex and is totally about little details, but there is always a larger framework from which you start - at least, base colors, fonts and general layout.<p>Some thinking got me to the idea that it is possible to make an aide for the process of defining this framework. The tool could offer different options for review and let the user pick something that they like from these. Here&#x27;s my first attempt to implement that:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;baesline.design<p>(Apologies in advance - the thing is totally mobile un-friendly at this point)<p>Currently the thing is definitely very naive, often produces awful stuff, but I have found that if you play with it for a while, it is possible to arrive at something meaningful, which actually can serve as a legit starting point for the final design.<p>Currently all the &quot;playing&quot; that you can do with the buttons at the top (or hotkeys) is:<p>- change the theme to something completely different\n- keep the logic of the theme, but remix the colors using the same palette (We use several dozen predefined palettes of 3-5 colors each)\n- keep the colors, but change everything else<p>The first one is where you start, the second two allow for some fine-tuning when you feel that you&#x27;re onto something.<p>As I said, this is where it starts. Some things that I would like to do to make it workable are:<p>- add an &quot;app mode&quot;, that would allow to generate and browse designs that are more suitable for web-applications that involve more complicated data presentation devices and more input\n- change and improve the generation process. The original idea was that the thing should offer a number of options first, letting you pick whichever you like most and than fine-tune the result based on those that you liked - also by letting you compare and pick from different options\n- allow saving themes for future reference\n- create some kind of reasonable exports - ideally into a Figma draft, but also maybe into html+css template or other forms.<p>But before jumping there I wanted to know whether all this sounds crazy or does it seem that with some improvement it can become usable and useful?",
