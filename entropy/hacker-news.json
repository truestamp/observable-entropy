(They have LTE hotspots that work near the coasts.) I would like crew to be able to view the cameras from various points on the boat at all times and for land staff to be able to view the cameras when the boats have an Internet connection.<p>It looks like the Ubiquity applications used to support these modes but the newer &quot;Unifi Protect&quot; lines expects to use cloud services.<p>I realize I can cobble together something that works in both modes. I am wondering if anyone has experience with hardware&#x2F;ecosystems that do not assume the cloud is omnipresent.",
