      "text": "I am in the current session of Hack Reactor. Galvanize has basically removed all Hack Reactor branding from the instructional content. Hack Reactor no longer offers any in-person courses or an SF campus.[1]\nThere appear to be about 30 students in the course, in the entire Western US (not just CA). They literally can&#x27;t fill sessions. The internal Slack is completely dead.<p>Worst of all, the material so far hasn&#x27;t been updated in at least 10 years, judging by the dates on the latest commits. We&#x27;re learning early 2000&#x27;s Doug Crockford-style JS. I wonder if the rest of the course material is like this, too.<p>The course still costs ~$20K.<p>Is Hack Reactor basically dead? Are there any Bay Area bootcamps that are a better deal and offer industry networking or employer contacts?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackreactor.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shift-to-remote-software-engineering-education",

      "text": "Is there such a notion of minimum exhaustive application or a benchmark application that really tests what it&#x27;s like to develop in a &quot;stack&quot; or programming language? One that is complex enough to cover real-world problems at scale.<p>In the ML world we have the notion of a benchmark dataset which we use to evaluate the performance of an ML model. (This approach has its own flaws.. models can potentially overfit on the benchmark data set)<p>After that you would need some criteria to evaluate the stack or programming language under consideration.<p>One response is to say &quot;there are too many potential things to test, this is not possible&quot; or you could go the other direction and say &quot;pick your favorite CRUD app&quot;. But wondering if these things have been thought out in a way that there is some type of happy medium.",
