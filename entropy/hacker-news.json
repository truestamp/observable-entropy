      "text": "Back in the day, we had thumb drives, external hard drives, internet download managers, torrent websites, video player software, and ways to download yt videos for later use.<p>But now there&#x27;s barely any need for those as streaming has pretty much replaced the old mediums of acquiring and consuming video. But having a look at youtube-dl&#x27;s repo, there&#x27;s more than 109k stars, which shows how popular the thing is. Even a DDG bug that would exclude youtube-dl from the search results received so much attention by HN.<p>Still though, I don&#x27;t understand why downloading from yt is so important nowadays. To be clear, I&#x27;m not asking whether it&#x27;s ethical or not. I&#x27;m asking <i>why</i> do people need to download stuff in the first place?",

      "text": "Some background: I&#x27;m 25, finished my undergrad 2 years ago. I went to work for a FANG straight out of college, and also was working on some social networking apps on the side that I started in college.<p>At some point my apps covered my living expenses and I decided to quit my job because I felt like it was sucking away my youth.<p>I make enough money every month to pay my bills, and I have a decent amount of savings.<p>I wake up everyday and want to work on something fulfilling, but don&#x27;t know where to start. I feel like I have no more purpose in life and am not sure how to spend my time.<p>I know this is a ridiculous first world problem, but it bothers me a lot. I tried studying math, buying drones, microscopes, and lots of other side hobbies but I need something to wake up to in the morning that keeps me hungry.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m dying slowly and am not sure what to do.",
