      "text": "I&#x27;m currently working on some software targeted at mathematicians. Part of this requires that the user can write parsers to parse custom notation. I would expect most mathematicians interested in this project to know at least some basic programming but I also think it would be too difficult to expect them to write a full recursive descent parser or similar for their own notation. My current plan is to expose a simple parser combinator library alternatively I was thinking of a parser generator instead. But I was wondering if there is an option which is even simpler for users. What is the simplest way to allow users to write custom parsers?",
