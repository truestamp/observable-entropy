      "text": "Recently I was looking to book a rental car for a family trip. I was looking for a larger vehicle (6+ passengers) so we could take one car. Minivans are completely unavailable and even with high gas prices SUVs are running $200+&#x2F;day. I searched the usual travel aggregator sites (Expedia, Kayak, Priceline) and prices were identical. The only interesting alternative that came up was Turo.<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for finding rental cars?",
