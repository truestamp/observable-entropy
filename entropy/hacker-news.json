I do have a portfolio of about 100 very decent domain names that are valued anywhere between around 2,500 and 25,000; generic names not infringing on anyone&#x27;s trademark, and yet they can be trademarked in the future. Think Time.com in 1992.<p>I was talking with a domain broker at a party a few months ago and he was telling me that he does &quot;outreach&quot;, hiring an offshore call center to cold call brands whose interesting dovetails with his domains.<p>Is that the best was to do it?<p>I am thinking about starting an LLC, transferring all my domains to it, and raise capital for the selling operations, but I have to come up with the selling strategy, that is the second part of the secret sauce.<p>Any innovative&#x2F;disruptive ideas?",
