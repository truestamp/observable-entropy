      "text": "I have been programming since I was a small kid (started on a Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer).  I later became an Electrical Engineer, but for a big company, which many will tell you isn&#x27;t like being a professional engineer, or working at a small firm.  I&#x27;ve only programmed professionally a few times, many times as part of a job, but not as my main job.<p>As COVID seems to be wrapping up and people are going back to the office, it appears that many companies are reneging on their original stance of keeping people remote.<p>I have a good job that I&#x27;ve been at for 15 years, and am doing great there, but am really dismayed at coming back to the office.  Working from home has become a lifestyle for me, and it really gets me that executives, who enjoy mostly total autonomy in the execution of their duties, are mandating that the rest of us be tethered to the office again.  It seems many didn&#x27;t learn anything from COVID (or didn&#x27;t care) about people&#x27;s desire to work away from an office, or about the sense of lack of trust it creates to put them in the office unnecessarily.  If I want to &quot;collaborate&quot;, I won&#x27;t hesitate to call someone.  I don&#x27;t need to sit at a desk without walls under bright lights so I might feel like being talkative with a coworker one day.<p>I&#x27;m making the assumption that there are coding jobs that I can get 100% virtual work in - is that still a valid assumption?  What&#x27;s the best way for me to get ready for those jobs?  Am I being crazy trying to do this at 45?  I have kids and a house and a decent salary, although I just heard yet another story from a coworker about how their nephew got hired at Google for $300K.  Is that even close to possible?  If so, I&#x27;m in the wrong business.  How many people who go to coding camps succeed in job placement?  Just looking for any helpful answers on charting a new course.<p>Thanks",

      "text": "I created a application (B) which handles extra functionalities and I want to receive from old legacy app (A) some metadata needed and I was thinking about implementing a straight implementation due to application infra limitations (I know it&#x27;s possible to implement event bus like rabbitmq or kafka but for the limitations imposed by this project I have to stick with only RESTful API). Basically, I was thinking about an approach which consists of exposing POST resource in service (B) which is consumed by service (A) in order to get metadata and create a session in (A) and in response I want to redirect user from service (A) to service (B). how is it possible to keep on track user journey while reserving sessions between these 2 apps and data in session. Long story short, I want using RESTful API to reserve user session info back and forth between these 2 apps. both apps are running PHP Frameworks",
