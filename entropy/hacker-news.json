      "text": "I was experiencing strange bot-&quot;Banned for spam&quot; events over the last few days on a subreddit with small (18) but very particular membership and viewers in the 100-several hundred range, despite the posts only being submitted on the subreddit itself (the promotion to the subreddit was done mostly off Reddit itself).<p>Last night my subreddit was banned as a result of &quot;Violating Reddit rules&quot; due to the alleged spam and I also got shadow-banned.<p>I tried explaining the the situation to r&#x2F;Reddit and they agreed I got caught up in the spam filter incorrectly and lifted the shadow-ban restriction, but so far I did not get a response about the subreddit itself that was banned as a result of the spam filters.<p>The content was &quot;let&#x27;s just say important&quot; for the viewership, which I would consider members of an important community in the real world, and the amount of work that went into it ... let&#x27;s just say A LOT of work went into it.<p>Does anybody know anything about or have any experience with restoring both a subreddit AND its contents?<p>Again, the amount of work that went into it, over a LONG period of time, is incomprehensible and duplicating it from scratch would not be possible.<p>Any help would be appreciated, please and thank you.",
