Not things you believe _should_ make things faster or lighter; only things that _do_.<p>But if the optimization costs you more in developer time than will be reclaimed in operations costs over the _entire lifetime of the code_... then it is premature.<p>Estimating this, though, is a challenge.<p>Just stating the obvious, I suppose.",
