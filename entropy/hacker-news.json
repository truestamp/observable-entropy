I looked into it after the LGThinQApp&#x27;s privacy policy changed to gather information like personal information like DOB, gender, voice recordings, profile photos, network activity: &quot;such as URL, ad block info, redirect URL, bookmark history etc.. Their privacy policy looks like it was meant for instagram..<p>This wasn&#x27;t the case at all before when I purchased the product. The nice feature was that I could preload my clothes and trigger them to wash&#x2F;dry before I&#x27;m about to get home. That&#x27;s all I expected from this. I even called support and asked them to deactivate my account but they said this can only be done through the app. And I can&#x27;t use the app unless I accept the new terms and services.<p>edit: added the privacy policy link here\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.m.lgaccount.com&#x2F;spx&#x2F;customer&#x2F;terms_detail?country=US&amp;language=en-US&amp;terms_type=A_ITG_PRV",
