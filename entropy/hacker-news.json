The operation is independent.<p>Webpage -&gt; API Gateway -&gt; API 1 -&gt; API 2 -&gt; DB<p>How should we implement retries?<p>We could add the retry mechanism somewhere in the back-end (API Gateway, API 1, or API 2) and I&#x27;m aware that it should implement exponential back-off and jittering but:<p>- how do I determine the correct exponential and jittering values? (500ms, 1s, etc)?<p>- If the retry mechanism takes too long, the user will get bored and refresh the webpage which could have a negative impact. How should we handle this? Should we not implement retries in the back-end at all? Or should we just make sure that the retry mechanism doesn&#x27;t take too long? In your experience, how long is too long for the user?<p>Thanks",
