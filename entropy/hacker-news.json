We have a few data backends (including SQL and Spark), and I&#x27;m looking for an easy way to write reports that get surfaced up to our end users, but with all the niceties like PDF generation, good printing support, templates, etc. I know Tableau and Looker have white label solutions, but they&#x27;re pretty expensive - any good recommendations for a smaller startup?",
