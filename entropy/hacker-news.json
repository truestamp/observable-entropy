      "text": "I&#x27;ve been indeterministically bouncing from one state to another (and back again) for longer than I would like to admit. Frankly, I&#x27;m in a while(1) loop, and I desperately need someone to hand me a &#x27;break.&#x27; I would love to settle on the decision and act upon it. For context, I&#x27;m 28, a non-EU resident, and have been programming for five years.<p>I have always wanted to get a degree in software engineering. However, when I first considered going to university, my math skills were far below the level required for passing the entrance exam. Despite not knowing how to add two fractions, I was determined to get into the study program I wanted in the future. Fast-forward a few years: I invested about 2K hours, scattered across three years, in mathematics only. Besides math, I read and programmed a lot. I was very disciplined and covered about 70% of the university curriculum I was aiming for, including areas like computer architecture, computer networks, computer security, databases, operating systems, compilers, etc.<p>Considering that I have very high aspirations (migrating to EU&#x2F;US, six-figure income, etc.), what should I do? There are some compelling things about enrolling in a university: I&#x27;m sure having a diploma is very valuable for the immigration process, and good networking can never hurt. But I keep seeing people who succeeded even without a degree. I don&#x27;t know their path in detail, but I know they have done it, although they are usually EU residents. Anyway, an inevitable question arises: why haven&#x27;t I enrolled earlier? It almost feels unfair now. I&#x27;ve put so much work into everything, and for what, only to start from the beginning again? Time is precious. Besides that, I&#x27;m a bit skeptical about how the networking part would turn out since I&#x27;d be 10+ years older than most students. On the other hand, I&#x27;m positive I would regret it for the rest of my life if I hadn&#x27;t at least tried. I know that I would be miserable if I stayed here forever.<p>I just need someone to nudge me in the right direction with a convincing argument.<p>Thanks for reading.",
