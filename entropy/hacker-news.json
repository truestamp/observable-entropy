      "text": "Hi fellow hackers,<p>SaaSHub has been growing in all directions for the last several months. One of these directions is the number of new products submitted to the marketplace: 150,034 as of writing now. My previous similar report was 100k products listed as of Dec 2019. That&#x27;s about 83 new products listed on average every day (based on a quick and imprecise calculation).<p>While that number might not be stunning for some investors, I&#x27;m proud of it, given that it&#x27;s a one-man-army show. What is more, I&#x27;ve been told (by an investor) that SaaSHub is starting to make some of the leaders in the space (like Capterra &amp; G2) a bit uneasy at night.<p>How did I achieve this? Small but consistent daily improvements six days a week.<p>One of my goals is to have all software products listed on SaaSHub and having them identify their competitors. That&#x27;s one of the most objective ways to prepare the lists with alternatives after that, and that&#x27;s what brings value to people browsing the website.<p>If you were running a website like SaaSHub, what would you work on next to make the most money out of it? (I&#x27;m making some $ - in the range of 4 digits&#x2F;monthly; however, I&#x27;m sure it could easily go up to 5 digits with a slight push).",
