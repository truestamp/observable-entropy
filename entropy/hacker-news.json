This is my first time doing such a task, what questions should I be asking of the proposals in order to identify the better ones out of the bunch?<p>Obviously I can differentiate based on the size of the teams offered and the time frames they propose, some also clearly have more consideration for the UX design of the product than others. Any advice or experiences offered would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
