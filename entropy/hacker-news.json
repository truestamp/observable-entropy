      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on a deep learning side project that needs GPU acceleration at inference time. My inference requests are very bursted, however, so I don&#x27;t need a box to be lying around while waiting for requests. I can stand to wait for a small interval (&lt;1min) before getting results back. Most of the options I&#x27;m seeing either assume full batch processing or persistent hosted boxes that lie around in between requests.<p>Is there anything like heroku dynos that can spin up to process a GPU compute request and then spin back down? What do you use for deep learning side projects?",

      "text": "As a college student and while completing assignments I realized that online information in English is more abundant than in Spanish sources. And as someone who went and came back from Japan only knowing how to say “hello” in Japanese I felt sad by not going deep into the country´s culture and thought that the information from the local population has something else to offer, something we, as tourists, might not see.<p>So if I were in China I would want to see information from Chinese sources and if I were in Russia I would like to see information about hotels in Moscow in Russian webpages.<p>With Google Chrome or any other web browser you would have to translate the search query on your own and then paste it on the search tab to see search results on that language, but wait! Do you understand the search results you are seeing? Maybe not. Well Konlap solves these problems and saves you time.<p>Want to know how it feels? Go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;konlap.co",
