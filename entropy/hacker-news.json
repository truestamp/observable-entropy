Are there specific sectors that are a safer bet in a recession, or should we simply focus (even) more on employability (gaining experience in multiple tech stacks, etc)? Are there lessons that people learnt from the the Dot-com Bubble and the 2007–2008 Financial Crisis that we need to remind ourselves of? Thanks in advance.",
