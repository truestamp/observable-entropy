      "text": "When I&#x27;m using my (Andorid) phone I keep seeing recurring ads for Whatsapp, Tiktok, Deliveroo, etc..<p>I have these apps installed, and some of them I use daily. So I&#x27;m wondering if the targeting is explicit or is just a mistake?<p>I see only 2 scenarios:<p>- The ad targeting system can&#x27;t see that I have these apps installed (Good i guess in terms of privacy)<p>- The ad system can see that I have the apps, but the companies still pushing their ads (waste of money?)<p>Does anyone here have any domain knowledge about these kind of ads?",
