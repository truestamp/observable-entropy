Like many physicians she feels sort of abused by the system - burnt out, feels like a cog in the wheel, she really cares about quality but that she&#x27;s incentivized only for speed, etc. etc.<p>I want to try to find a place she could work where she could use her background but also enjoy her job. I&#x27;ve always felt like small companies are great because everyone is more likely to care - IMO probably the best heuristic for whether a place will be enjoyable to work at.<p>tldr does anyone have any suggestions for finding companies trying to push the envelope&#x2F;be innovative&#x2F;actually care about patients over $&#x2F;etc.? I was hoping there could be some health care related start up that would work.",
