      "text": "OK. 1. Let&#x27;s pretend I&#x27;m a 5 yo, but I&#x27;ve been around for 45 years. I have only ever used so-call &quot;web2&quot; platforms, and have never in my life coded (accept in a class in hs in the early 90s, would have no idea what to do with a server if I had one, and have never used a platform that didn&#x27;t just &quot;run&quot; once you downloaded it. In other words, let&#x27;s assume I&#x27;m everyone who&#x27;s never heard of HN. How would you explain to me how to access (is that even the right word?) a blockchain?<p>2. This seems like the right time to ask this, as I have a feeling it deals with the same thing. If I wanted to play around with something like this Zooko thing (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29912396) which I don&#x27;t necessarily, I just think it&#x27;s a good example, being the person I mentioned above, how would I do that???<p>3. Are there books I can read so as not to bother the HN community?",
