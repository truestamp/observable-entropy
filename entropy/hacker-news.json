      "text": "Hello, I am a developer and most companies I worked for offer a &quot;learning budget&quot; you can spend on videos, courses, conferences relative to your job to keep your skills sharp. I have always appreciated the benefit but I have always had trouble finding good quality material. What do you guys suggest is a good way of spending this money?<p>I liked uncle&#x27;s Bob videos (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cleancoders.com&#x2F;) and found some good courses here as well https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ui.dev&#x2F;.<p>Do you have any other suggestions?",
