      "text": "The PSD2 regulation in the Euro-zone now requires two-factor authentication for online credit card payments. So for every payment with my credit card, &quot;Verified by Visa&quot; or &quot;Mastercard SecureCode&quot; pop up and ask me to authenticate. <i>Depending on the bank, the authentication can require the same credentials used to login to the online banking account.</i><p>The authentication requirement is a bit of a hassle (CC network should bear the fraud risk), but the part that seems absurd to me is that <i>the integration is done as an iFrame</i>. That means ordinary users are now trained to enter their banking credentials on random websites—the opposite of what they learned in years of phishing education.<p>Does anyone understand how it came to this?",
