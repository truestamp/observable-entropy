      "text": "Hi YC family,<p>Have you ever forgotten where you got a particular information from when you needed it the most? Being researchers, we face this issue on a regular basis as a typical research life involves years of effort reading and writing research papers.<p>That’s why we, a team of scholars from IISER Mohali &amp; IISc Bangalore, have built ResNote (resnote.com) . Using our chrome extension, you can take notes anywhere from the web with a simple drag and drop or a right click; and all your relevant information will be saved along with their source automatically. Along with this, we have 2 more AI products in the suite to summarize YouTube videos and to convert your handwritten notes into typed notes just by uploading a photo. This can ultimately help you organize your references and thereby will save you a lot of time in reading and writing research papers (50x faster). Also, you no longer need to download tons of pdfs that just lie unopened on your laptop.<p>It has been a privilege being associated with YC community and as a form of gratitude, we are sending you exclusive 3 months pro-usage coupons (worth $10&#x2F;month each) for all the professors, students, academicians, lawyers who are dealing with all sorts of research. Kindly use &quot;YCPRO3&quot; as your referral coupon code while creating an account at resnote.com or add this code in your profile section.<p>Visit: resnote.com<p>Regards,\nSaswat Pattnaik\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;saswat-pattnaik-b82b1316a&#x2F;\n(+91) 8283016334",
