Whereas most consumer&#x2F;saas apps with early adopters DON&#x27;T need 99.99% reliability and aren&#x27;t going viral. And even if they go viral they could always have cloud as back up.<p>It just feels like cult-like behavior to always be on AWS regardless of the circumstances.<p>10M in funding? sure, knock yourself out.<p>200k? you are gonna be broke by next quarter...<p>It&#x27;s like paying for 5 bed room apartment when you are single dude and don&#x27;t even have a pet... why?<p>same argument for breaking into services&#x2F;micro-services... you can buy 10 servers and scale 10x while keeping monorepo and ultimately speed of development. We secured funding, lets make 20 services to scale, you have like 1000 DAU barely",
