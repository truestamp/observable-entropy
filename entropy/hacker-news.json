Think of it like Slack’s saved items, but better.<p>You can use Rewind to tag a message as ‘todo’, ‘readlater’, ‘feature-research’, ‘togetback’, pretty much anything you would like. The app is great if you have a lot going on in your Slack.<p>I think many of us moved from Gmail to Slack and find it really hard to manage all the incoming messages, so I&#x27;m hoping Rewind will be useful for a lot of people.<p>Check it out here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rewindapp.io&#x2F;",
