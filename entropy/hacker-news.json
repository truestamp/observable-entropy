      "text": "We&#x27;re creating a new marketplace startup, intending to have people from all over the world purchase (digital) items from other countries also all over the world!<p>I&#x27;m struggling on VAT however.  We&#x27;re not in a new area, so I&#x27;m hoping that somebody from HN can point me in the right direction.  Reading about this it looks like I have two options:<p>- I have to limit where my buyers &#x2F; sellers can be located purely to countries I&#x27;m registered in for paying VAT.<p>- I register for vat in all countries.<p>- I have to find the &#x27;minimum taxable threshold&#x27; for each country.  If it&#x27;s a reasonable amount of money, I include that country as allowed and wait until that country has earnt some amount  below the threshold before regisitering for paying VAT in that country.<p>The latter option seems the best, but finding the value for four countries took me 20 minutes earlier.  Doing it for all countries is going to take too much time that could be spent improving the service, etc.  Is there a simpler way?",
