Since it is for development I want something relatively powerful, e.g. Intel Core i7-11800H processor, 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe drive.  However, since it is just for developing, I don&#x27;t need a great video card.  Since takes a lot of gaming laptops out of the running since you are paying a premium for a graphics card that is just wasted.  Finally, since it is for professional use, it would be nice to have the option of extended warranty&#x2F;support.  I would want to minimize downtime in the case of an issue so I can get back to work.",
