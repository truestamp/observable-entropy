      "text": "I&#x27;ve been contemplating the idea of moving over my accounts on various services to an email on my own domain (mail@pietro72ohboy.com instead of mail@gmail.com). Since this email will serve as a gateway to accessing (and recovering access if needed) for all services, I&#x27;d want it to be reasonably secure. I&#x27;ve tried to stick with services that allow an extra 2FA over the traditional username&#x2F;password login and I&#x27;m currently using fastmail for this.<p>I&#x27;d like to go back to using a service like Migadu that offer a simple, standard mail account accessible through IMAP and SMTP. Would an account secured by a sufficiently powerful password be secure enough? Or is 2FA a must for such accounts.",

      "text": "Hey HN,<p>Today, I&#x27;m announcing the public release of MVP of Rebudget, a personal finance app that I&#x27;ve been working on over the last 2 years.  Rebudget helps you create a budget and track your personal finances using the zero-based budgeting or the envelope method.  I originally started working on this mostly as a fun side project to experiment and see what I could do, but also as a potential Mint&#x2F;YNAB replacement for myself (as well as my wife&#x27;s spreadsheet!).<p>There is still a lot of work to be done (it may be a little rough around the edges in some places), but I&#x27;m excited about the challenges and work ahead.<p>I&#x27;m open to any questions or feedback that is provided. Thanks!",
