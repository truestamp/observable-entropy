I pay for the healthcare compliant enterprise version of Zoom.<p>Anyone here know anything about this? Should we accept joining the class for the suit? Is there more information about the case?<p>The allegations section is copied here:\n&quot;(i) shared certain information with third parties, (ii) should have done more to prevent unwanted meeting disruptions by third parties, (iii) advertised its Zoom Meetings App as being encrypted “end-to-end” when Plaintiffs contend it was not at that time, and (iv) that the alleged conduct violated California state and federal laws. Zoom denies these allegations. The Court has not decided who is right.&quot;<p>ZoomMeetingsClassAction.com",
