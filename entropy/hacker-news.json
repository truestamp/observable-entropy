      "text": "I recently started trying to be better about organizing links, thoughts, PDFs, etc so I can more easily pull things up when I only remember a fragment. So far haven&#x27;t been able to find a great solution. My requirements are that it caches webpages (and PDFs), supports tags, and has a decent iOS app that syncs to the cloud. Bonus if it has full text search and the ability to upload files not from a URL.<p>I tried Pinboard and it&#x27;s pretty good, but the caching is extremely unreliable, the full-text search isn&#x27;t full-text, and the support is completely unresponsive. I tried historious and it also nearly fits the bill but it doesn&#x27;t have an iOS app and the bookmarklet doesn&#x27;t work on PDFs for whatever reason.",
