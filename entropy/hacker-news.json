      "text": "I am a long-in-the-tooth IT professional working at a bank. I have just had yet another issue with our company&#x27;s SOE (seems to be DNS config related, but of course I have no admin rights to try anything). I understand the need for locked down corporate environments but why-oh-why are most of them built by people who don&#x27;t actually understand (or test) what they&#x27;re doing? We regularly get &quot;security&quot; changes pushed through which break various bits of &quot;legit&quot; corporate internet as well as some applications we are permitted to use. I should point out our company uses a third-party to manage our fleet of PCs. My question to all is - has someone come up with a &quot;SOE as a Service&quot;? There&#x27;s got to be a market for something like this where companies can basically sign up to, where the service is provided by those who actually know what they are doing. I tried searching for this and didn&#x27;t really find anything turnkey.",
