So I don&#x27;t have a lot of advice to give but I can share something with the community.<p>Here are biggest delusions I overcame,  throughout my 7 year career.<p>1. Shared Hosting(Cpanel) is not beneath me.<p>Seduced by Hype Driven development, I wanted to pad my resume by learning the latest technologies. \nWhy would I host my site on shared hosting? No real programmer would use phpmyadmin, my project would have 1M users on day one, I needed a bare metal VPS. \nThe irony is that I ended up recreating a buggy, half baked version of CPanel.<p>2. PHP is beneath me.<p>I was ashamed to tell people I use php. On reddit, youtube and HN real programmers used Haskell and React. Everything should be a bloated javascript SPA, with an overly complex toolchain.  Since the average joe without formal training could figure out how to FTP files and have a site running, I needed to be different. I was too good for PHP.<p>3. Wordpress is  beneath me.<p>I was afraid that people would &quot;view source&quot; on my project, see that it&#x27;s built with Wordpress. I thought they would silently judge me.  I wasted months upon months, re-inventing the wheel, I could have delivered a working product in a matter of weeks.<p>All this to say.<p>I might never build a  product that reaches 100k active users. I might never make it on top of Hacker News, I might never get featured on TechCrunch and it&#x27;s okay.<p>I don&#x27;t have to be the best programmer in the world. It&#x27;s okay to build little programs and apps for small businesses, with a simple database and a simple front-end.<p>I might never work for a MicroMetaGooAppleZon, it&#x27;s okay too<p>I might never break into 6 figures and it&#x27;s okay too.<p>This was the best realization I made.<p>Life is good once I figured that out.<p>Thanks for reading.",
