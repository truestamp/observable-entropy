      "text": "Hey,<p>I continuously have discussions with loved ones, that are affected by fake news regarding the current covid-19 pandemic.<p>It is really difficult do argue with them, because they are well informed in their bubble and have a lot of arguments that are hard to counter. I don&#x27;t have the time to counter-proof every single fallacy.<p>I observed that all these people frequently get new posts and even longer videos. They use these to let me &#x27;understand&#x27; their point of view. Watching these videos to have a basis to discuss on is time consuming, too. There are fewer videos to counter these - and in my experience just sending back counter videos does not help to convince them.<p>Have you experienced similar problems? Did you find a practical solution for your situation?",
