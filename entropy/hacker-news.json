      "text": "I have been listening to A LOT of Darknet Diaries [0] lately. Jack&#x27;s latest 2 part episode on Citizen lab [1] and the NSO [2] has me concerned about my family&#x27;s cyber security status.<p>We use 1Password, complex passwords, MFA where ever possible. We also have mostly Apple devices and I&#x27;m always making sure updates are installed. But the more I learn, the more it seems that isn&#x27;t enough. Some research shows there are lots of products&#x2F;services out there monitoring&#x2F;protecting business&#x2F;enterprise (e.g. CloudStrike) but is there a product&#x2F;service that exists specifically geared for individuals&#x2F;families? Thanks!<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darknetdiaries.com\n[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darknetdiaries.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;99\n[2] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;darknetdiaries.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;100",
