I do this so that when I have free time, I can mull over the site properly and do some &#x27;deep work&#x27;.<p>But the bookmarks are starting to pile up, full of cool and interesting things I can leverage, yet I <i>don&#x27;t</i> leverage them. They sit there looking pretty without action taken on them.<p>Is this a form of procrastination? I promise to myself I will revisit these bookmarks, but they linger there, unused, like a treasure chest that is unclaimed.<p>If you bookmark like myself, how frequently do you act upon these links? Do you make full use of bookmarking services, or maybe 10% of the links stored there are actionable?",
