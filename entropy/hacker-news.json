      "text": "I’m currently listing the pros and cons of moving to a big city from a small town. I have nine pros, and only 2 cons which are + cost of living and having to downsize.<p>I feel that I am bored out of my mind where I live. On weekends I’m rushing out of here to the city to hang out with my friends or go eat some new food. I also like the hustle and bustle.<p>I’m also working on my own stuff and feel like all the tech entrepreneurs and meetups are in the city. There aren’t really that many interesting things going in my small town, at least that I’m interested in.<p>I already come to terms that I can’t afford a house yet in my state. So I’m gonna take a chance and go to the city, maybe it works out from a networking and growth perspective. I’m not sure how I’m working on that from my small town. Please help with some insights or advice.",
