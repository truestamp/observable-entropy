      "text": "Why do large venues throttle reception at entrances to events? Surely if it’s for an attack vector people can just use long distance radios - 5g works inside the event, so it’s probably not a technical limitation. Im at coachella, and we cant even call an uber or lyft to get out at the end pf the night. Im with somebody that works in management at a large nightclub in toronto, and she said they do this also in Toronto. What is the reasoning?",
