      "text": "I thought this may be of interest to us desk workers...<p>I&#x27;ve recently been trying a cheap unbranded massage cushion on my work chair. It has two rotating heads and seems quite good for keeping my middle back more mobile.<p>Alas the things aren&#x27;t very durable. The rotating heads are driven by a plastic worm gear, which if you lean in hard - as I often do - soon wears out and starts skipping.<p>Has anyone found a similar product that can deliver a hard massage without breaking? If so which? Have you looked inside to check whether the gears are plastic or metal?",
