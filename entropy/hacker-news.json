I want to leverage old RPG games to teach spanish or french reading to kids (native speakers).<p>We plan to use PC (vs app) as translations of games are easier to find, there&#x27;s a larger library, and the PC is easy to contain (no wifi,  no dark patterns etc).<p>We started with Final Fantasy I (NES), but stopped once we realized its not text heavy - its mostly a grind.<p>So, I wanted to ask HN, which fun (and preferably, old) games you played with tons of text that was suitable for very young (4-7yr old) kids ?",
