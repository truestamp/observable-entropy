All of my open source projects typically have at least markdown and YAML present. I typically employ a specialized formatter&#x2F;linter for the project-specific language, but handling the other types has always been a pain.<p>Prettier is the closest thing I&#x27;ve found, even if it&#x27;s primarily targeting Javascript. My biggest gripe is the dependencies that it ships with. I&#x27;d love to find a static binary that can accomplish the same thing. Any suggestions?",
