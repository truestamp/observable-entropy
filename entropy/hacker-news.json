I just can’t imagine performing in roles like this. I’m not an expert at anything, besides maybe figuring out how to figure out things I want to do. At the same time, I don’t feel much like a junior or anything. I have very cursory understanding of a lot of stuff, but a large swath of it is useless because I don’t have any experience back it up.<p>What are the typical moves for someone in this sort of situation.",

Apart from the most obvious problems of not integrating security into DevOps or not testing the dependencies, do you guys know of any case studies of companies that have made large mistakes (security-wise) when building applications in an agile manner?",
