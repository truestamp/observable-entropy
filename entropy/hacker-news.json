No issues as of now but I want to take care of them before anything happens.<p>Couple of things I am doing right now. During the day, moved to single monitor and immediately noticed less strain on the eyes and neck. During night started spending at least couple of minutes in a room(not bedroom) with out any major light source either meditating or chatting with partner, it provides major relief.<p>What tactics are you following and any resources which talks about practical eye health.",
