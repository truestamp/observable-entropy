However I have always felt that those\nsystems are not specifically centered around product&#x2F;software development lifecycle (releases, real users feedback over a product entire lifetime, so on) and often too broad or not designed specifically\nfor that type of work, which is ok.<p>Why?<p>As an opensource author I would like to have constant real users feedback, not necessarily\ntied only to bugs and feature requests. And even if my project is not that big and not\nthat promoted I still want my voice will be heard among myriads of other projects\nand to gain my own community.<p>Who?<p>Opensource authors seeking to build community around products they maintain<p>Users seeking for relevant and well maintained software to fit best theirs needs<p>What?<p>Welcome mybfi.io, see the &quot;Principles&quot; article on mybfi.io site - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mybf.io&#x2F;article&#x2F;Principles\nexplaining some of those principles in more details.<p>PS The mybfio service is still in active development, things might change, but any feedback is\nvaluable.",
