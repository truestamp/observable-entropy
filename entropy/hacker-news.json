      "text": "Many IT companies &amp; startups boast about hiring the best 1% talent. While I believe contrary. I think that any developer can be a better developer with proper training &amp; positive environment. In my 13 years of professional experience, I have worked with hundreds of engineers. I have seen how a mediocre engineer from a tier3 city college becomes an amazing programmer. I strongly believe that it’s the company’s responsibility to train and skill their staff and make them the best.<p>For every young engineer, here are the tips to become the best engineer.<p>- Reading Habits: Read tech blogs like Gizmodo &amp; Techcrunch on daily bases. Understand what’s going on in the industry.\n- Community &amp; Meetups: Participate in relevant developer community events. Organise or be part of meetup groups. Communicate ideas with fellow engineers.\n- Open source: Open sourcing the code is the best way to learn. Create your own open-source projects or contribute to an existing one on Github.\n- Hackathon: Participate in hackathons, build smaller apps and websites. The best way to learn is to build.<p>Have positivity and believe in yourself.",
