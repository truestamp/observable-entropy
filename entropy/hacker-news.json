      "text": "I have a habit of overthinking for almost the things which happened and about to happen in the future. I am a bit sensitive and emotional because of this whenever i go through emotional feelings for example if someone asks me about something they need or wanted my opinion for further proceedings if i am not able to fulfil or by mistake if i deny them i feel guilt after that and this thought will be haunting me for a while in a loop. Recently i learnt to be in the moment and practising mindfulness that is to be in the present moment whenever these guilt thoughts come over in a loop i apply mindfulness strategy and i’m seeing progress in this and one more technique is to re-route the current thoughts by distracting yourself like going for a gym, talking to somebody you feel comfortable. One improvement i have seen is going for gym and doing workout really helps in the process of workout you will get tiered so excessive thinking or anxiety will settle down in no time. I have been in contact with my psychiatrist and therapist almost for year and this really helped me. psychiatrist gives courage and guide me how to handle obsessive thoughts and my therapist on weekly basis listen to me and re-route my negative thoughts to positive thoughts and i can open with him easily and discuss whatever fearful, nasty thoughts that i went through in that week which i am seeing as powerful positive change because earlier i was no clue what to do when these negative thoughts were bubbling and i used to go deep inside these thoughts due to which i was getting panic and anxiety attacks.Now it is in control i will change completely to a positive and confident person.",
