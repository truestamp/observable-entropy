We tried many solutions over the years and apart from the long ago FB consumed and discarded drop.io, nothing fit our needs.<p>How we sell with Whatboard (at our sister company): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatboard.app&#x2F;b&#x2F;singleviewselling<p>How we delegate with Whatboard (at a related entity): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatboard.app&#x2F;b&#x2F;singleviewdelegation<p>Thank you in advance to anyone in the HN community interested in providing feedback, and to a certain 14 year old Gracklflint whose QA participation with our dev team made this even more enjoyable.",
