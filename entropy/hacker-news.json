      "text": "Hey! This is a reader mode browser extension I built that hides noisy page elements rather than extracting and re-rendering their text content. The idea is to not make all articles look the same [0], have them still render graphs, and ideally to work in more cases.<p>There are a few &quot;tricks&quot;: patching the site CSSOM to apply simpler mobile styles even at desktop width, cleaning up parents of DOM text nodes, blocklists for class names that contain words like &quot;sidebar&quot;, plus manual CSS patches for popular sites.<p>I got carried away and also added a dark mode, page outlines, privates notes &amp; inline Hacker News comments. [1] \nThe last feature works by parsing every top-level HN comment with a quote in it (formatted with &gt; or &quot;&quot;) within a few minutes, and anchoring these quotes in the story article HTML. So when you open a link you&#x27;ll directly see the parts people are talking about here. [2]<p>The extension code is all on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindylearn&#x2F;unclutter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindylearn&#x2F;unclutter</a><p>---<p>[0] Unclutter vs the Firefox reader mode: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindylearn&#x2F;unclutter&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;comparison.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindylearn&#x2F;unclutter&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;compa...</a><p>[1] The linked website show some examples for these.<p>[2] It&#x27;s also fun to try this on some of the &quot;HN classics&quot; that got 30+ quote comments over the years. The list at hn.lindylearn.io&#x2F;best shows the number of &quot;annotations&quot; a link has beneath its title.",
