      "text": "I read about this in a kind of new-agey self-help book more than 10 years ago and I don&#x27;t remember the author or the book title. I&#x27;m looking for the source. It&#x27;s something like this:<p>1. Something happens to you - interaction with a person, some mundane or significant event, whatever it is.<p>2. You have your &quot;first response&quot; to it - that&#x27;s the first thought that comes to you after the event, maybe it&#x27;s your first reaction when you read a comment online, or when a colleague does something you don&#x27;t like etc.<p>3. You discard your first response and think &quot;if that&#x27;s not my response, then what is&quot;. A second possible response comes up in your head. You get rid of that one too.<p>4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a while - possible ways to respond occur to you and you discard them.<p>The general idea was that the later responses are more mature, more compassionate, more useful etc. and you systematically working your way to them.<p>Any idea where this is from?",
