      "text": "Been using draw.io&#x2F;app.diagrams.net for a long time, with fairly decent results, but I am running now into a client pushing very strong in having all his stuff built into excalidraw, and only as a backup (with proper justification) lucidchart. As I am totally unaware of excalidraw capabilities, it&#x27;s fairly tough to push back, especially as it looks like Confluence integrates fairly well with either of these last two alternatives, but I am very concerned about a long learning curve, before delivering the actual results, with the ease I could now produce in draw.io.<p>So the Qs: has anyone had any experience with any type of transition between the three (maybe even in the other direction than what I am presented with), to know if there are some integration &#x2F; translation from one to another &#x2F; tips on how to handle all these tools, in migration of material, or an argument so obvious in favor of one, that might be worth investing the time to learn it (if draw.io is not the one, in my case, but the Q is more generic)",
