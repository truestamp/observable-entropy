For example, to send someone a $20 payment, you just CC: $20@pyffr.com in the email you send them.<p>Hacker News members get a $10 initial spending credit to try Pyffer.  Use the credit to send $5 to a colleague or someone whose work you want to support:<p>•  CC: $5@pyffr.com in an email you send them.<p>•  You&#x27;ll get an auto-reply from Pyffr with a link to confirm your payment (and you would fund it from the $10 credit you get),<p>•  Your recipient will get an email from Pyffr that your offer is confirmed and the $5 is held in escrow.<p>•  You and and your recipient should CC: $5@pyffr.com as you reply to each other.<p>•  You can close the offer at any time and release the $5 to your recipient.<p>•  Your recipient can withdraw it via PayPal or Venmo.<p>The overall idea is to facilitate adding a payment to regular email communication (as opposed to just to sending a payment to an email “address” as in PayPal, Zelle, etc.).<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyffr.com",
