      "text": "I&#x27;ve been noticing a trend lately of US companies hiring outside of the US to save money. I&#x27;m not talking about outsourcing, I&#x27;m talking about hiring capable full time engineers in places like Canada, Central America and Europe. (The first two have no time zone issues; Europe is manageable for East coast companies). Some companies still hire in the US, but prefer low cost of living regions.<p>Isn&#x27;t that worrisome for US based people? I&#x27;m wondering what will be the impact on US salaries, esp in tech.",

      "text": "I need to deliver a technical user guide for field technicians to follow for configuring some devices. The current solution is a word doc which requires some brain power to fill in appropriate values (naming, IP, etc) as you progress in the steps.<p>I&#x27;d like to replace this with some kind of self-contained HTML where they can fill in the &quot;variables&quot; at the top and have it auto-generate throughout the doc.  This is pretty simple with HTML&#x2F;JS, but the code can get messy if not done right.<p>Is there some framework like ReadTheDocs where I can easily write out RsT or Markdown, inserting variables with jinja2 (as an example) that can be input in an input field, and have it dynamically render live in-browser (which I believe then rules Sphinx out)?",
