Paid or free, what is important to me is the quality. I have tried googling around, but I cannot tell what is good from what is bad.<p>Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for resources that help me answer questions such as: do these colours go together, what are the right proportions of these objects, what would be the right font here.<p>I&#x27;m not looking for technical resources such as: how to make a transparent rectangle in GIMP.",
