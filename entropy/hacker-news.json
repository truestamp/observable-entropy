      "text": "The https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prooftoys.org&#x2F; website presents logic and basic mathematics\nof the real numbers. It includes a practical embedded deductive system \nfor learners whose background may be just ordinary high school mathematics. \nThe site includes:<p>1. An introduction to logic through pictures, basically interactive Venn\n   diagrams with explanation. This is a point of view on propositional calculus.<p>2. A brief presentation of the rules of the logic of &quot;simple type theory&quot; at a\n   raw beginner&#x27;s level.<p>3. A number of completely rigorous simple proofs, some in pure logic,\n   and some about real numbers, starting from the classic &quot;complete ordered\n   field&quot; axioms that define the behavior of real numbers. The proofs are all\n   done by computer from the ground up using the logic and axioms\n   (with a handful of gaps). The proofs are all available for reading\n   online, down to any level of detail, interactively, and at the reader&#x27;s discretion.<p>4. A web-based tool that lets you build and edit your own proofs.<p>I am seeking user input on the site, and will gladly answer all kinds of \nquestions as far as I am able.",
