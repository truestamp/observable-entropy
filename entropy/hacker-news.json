      "text": "Hello HN. I&#x27;m early in my life, still living with my parents, finished vocational school with a basic degree in information technology, and I have type 1 narcolepsy.<p>I haven&#x27;t done any programming after finishing the vocatonal school in 2018. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d even qualify as a script-kiddie anymore either since I&#x27;ve forgotten most of what I was taught.<p>I like fiddling with things (Rainmeter, ReShade, Addons and Plugins for games, previously set-up a pi-hole, have set-up YogaDNS w&#x2F; NextDNS, I&#x27;ve rigged and weightmapped models for VRChat)<p>My only job experience is in physical IT support (printers, broken PCs, setting up new laptops, backing-up laptops to external drives or clonezilla over network) but I burnt myself out and had to recover for close to 8 months, and I already had super flex short hours..<p>What I guess I&#x27;m asking is what the hell can I do other than become my own employer and hope I can figure something out (3D printing service? Hosting??)<p>I am sorry if this is out of place somehow.",
