      "text": "I have been working with Python for quite a while now. Although I am very productive with it I feel I might have grown far too comfortable with the language where I have started noticing it having disadvantages for my work and my personal growth.<p>I am able to program in any language given some time and google. So solving a problem doesn&#x27;t seem to be where I am lacking. I have been able to scratch a little more than the surface but not deep enough to actually use the language for whatever its strengths are advertised for. These include C, Java, Rust, Go, Bash, Javascript, Powershell where I have written trivial but useful programs.<p>There are too many to choose from and I do not know which and how to choose. Languages which have been recommended to me include C, C++, Java, Go, Scala, Javascript&#x2F;Typescript, Assembly, Scheme, OCaml, Common Lisp, Clojure, Kotlin, Erlang, Elixir, Haskell<p>Can anyone suggest further languages to enhance myself in terms of what I have missed by having Python as my only language? I am looking to categorize them into two - ones I can learn for personal growth and ones I can learn for expanding job opportunities. I&#x27;m open to multiple languages in each category.<p>People who have learnt multiple languages which include python please share your experience.",
