Is this idea worth further development?\n2. Have you seen any potential use cases of it?\n3. Are you interested in trying it when MVP&#x2F;v1 is ready? If yes, would you like to share your email for contact.<p>Appreciate any comments&#x2F;feedback, it helps me to decide what to build, reach out cao@columns.ai",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been on vacation (at home) for the past 3 weeks and this past week, I&#x27;ve become really bored. The first two weeks of vacation I felt great relaxing since I had a stressful month before this but that feeling has gone away now. I started working on a hobby project but I lost interest. Instead, I just feel unmotivated to do anything except watch TV all day. I do exercise and cook everyday but that&#x27;s about it. I think I realized the work schedule that I was following kept me sane even though it was also causing me a lot of stress. Maybe it&#x27;s because a lot of places near me are limited&#x2F;closed due to COVID but I don&#x27;t know.<p>This came out as more of a rant but I was wondering if other people felt the same?",
