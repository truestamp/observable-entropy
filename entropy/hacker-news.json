      "text": "All, two or three years ago, I found an incredible deal for a used very high spec HP Chromebook and I jumped on it for my now 9 year old.<p>So it’s still working great, and she uses it all the time for online school and Roblox (via android app capability).  However, I feel like it might be holding her back from learning how actual computers and traditional OS’es work.  I feel like she can’t really “explore” and do other things on it that she might otherwise do with a Windows or Linux laptop.<p>Do I need to get her a Windows(&#x2F;Linux) laptop asap to widen her technical horizons?  Not interested in a Mac for cost and other reasons..",
