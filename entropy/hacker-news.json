      "text": "I was wondering if there is VC appetite for defense based tech companies.<p>We are in advanced talks (hence the throw away) with M&amp;A teams of various of the top defense contractors for our startup, but me as CTO can&#x27;t help but wonder if a VC model for us going forward wouldn&#x27;t also be a good fit. Traditionally VC&#x27;s shied away from hardware and defense startups but with the funding round of Anduril perhaps this is changing.<p>Katherine Boyle of A16Z also had something to say about how VC investment and Defense in the past didn&#x27;t make sense, but that things could be changing [1].<p>The second problem with VC&#x27;s is it is notoriously difficult to get in contact with the correct person, thus the proposal below. Dang let me know if this is not allowed please.<p>If there are any VC&#x27;s perhaps interested you can contact me here<p>throwawaydefence at gmail dot com<p>and I can send you our prospectus &#x2F; NDA agreement.<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.defensenews.com&#x2F;smr&#x2F;cultural-clash&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;30&#x2F;the-math-doesnt-make-sense-why-venture-capital-firms-are-wary-of-defense-focused-investments&#x2F;",
