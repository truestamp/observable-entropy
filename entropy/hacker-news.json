      "text": "My company has web app users all over the world. They collaborate in real-time, and the app is very write-heavy.<p>Latency became a huge issue for database writes. The solution we came up with was to split up the app -- multiple regions with their own master database (no syncing cross-regions) and subdomain (e.g. africa.mywebsite.com).<p>This is working well. There is no concern that there will be any cross-region collaboration between users (at least for now). But it feels like a hack. I want everyone to just be able to go to app.mywebsite.com regardless of region.<p>There has to be a better way. What strategies are other companies using to solve latency across the globe?",
