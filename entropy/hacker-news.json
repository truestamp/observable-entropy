      "text": "Some things that come to mind are\n 1. Swappable config files (hard to do in frameworks like django where config is code)\n 2. Can&#x27;t use proprietary 3rd party apis in core logic or if you do there has to be an open interface to be able to adapt to different vendors (payment_provider_interface vs stripe)\n 3. Minimize friction for new developer to spin up copy. Meaning if you&#x27;re forced to rely on multiple services, use something like docker compose to allow a single command to bring up the who command after a git clone.<p>What are some of your ideas?",
