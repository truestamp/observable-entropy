      "text": "This is a personal project born from the need to have a good (free and open-source) units convertor on my phone (hence the UI; I now use it as a Cordova app).\nThe short story is that there was a time when I was converting from inches to centimeters very often, and the tool that I used for doing so was a simple DuckDuckGo search like this: &quot;5 inch to cm&quot;. I got tiered of that and thought &quot;It would be great to have the GNU units cli on my phone, but with some nice interface&quot;. Turned out that was possible using WebAssembly. This is the results.\nI&#x27;ve added some bells and whistles, like the option to be able to save certain units calculations as calculators. The data for the order and the deletion&#x2F;creation of the calculators is stored in the browser using Local Storage.\nThe source code for the project can be found here:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yanosh-k&#x2F;units-wasm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yanosh-k&#x2F;units-wasm</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yanosh-k&#x2F;gnu-wasmunits\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;yanosh-k&#x2F;gnu-wasmunits</a>",
