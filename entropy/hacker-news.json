      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;m a mid career technologist, and was thinking of picking up a coursera plus sub this year. I&#x27;m looking for good technical courses that will put some updated credentials on my cv. I am an autodidact (always learning new stuff anyways .. point of the coursera sub is mainly to help the CV). I do have a PhD in CS from 15 years ago from a top-20 school.<p>There was a specialization in Math for DL&#x2F;ML that I&#x27;m quite sure I&#x27;d like to do. Am generally interested in getting some creds around ML&#x2F;Datascience, Natural Language, Computer vision, other related AI things. Suggestions welcome!",
