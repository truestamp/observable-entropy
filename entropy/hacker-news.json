      "text": "I haven&#x27;t interacted anything to do with Meta as except to reading articles about the stock crash, but it seems that both for me and my circle of friends we noticed that Facebook (as a platform) has apparently launched a new (at least by the looks of it) video ad, in addition to increase in banner ads. Is Facebook&#x2F;Meta beginning to get desperate that they launched new ad campaigns or is it just isolated to us?",

      "text": "We believe the mobile games and apps publishing ecosystem is poorly developed for indie developers, small studios, and small publishers.<p>The way it works -<p>1. A developer submits an app&#x2F;game prototype to various publishers.<p>2. Publishers review. They only contact the developer if they find the app&#x2F;game suitable to their business model.<p>3. They get into some revenue-sharing legal agreement. In most cases, if the developer is indie and does not understand legal language, the terms favor the publisher.<p>4. Afterward, the developer becomes a contractor for the publisher that most creative people hate.<p>This structure works well for large to mid-level publishers and well-funded game studios.<p>Similarly, the bar is high for small publishers and creative indie developers to get into this industry.<p>At AuctionVilla Marketplace, we are working toward breaking this monopoly and bringing more creative controls. We help developers to sell their mobile games and apps IPs, including the store listing for a fixed price or through auction.<p>We are currently working with around 25 developers and listed 14+ selected apps. As a trial earlier, we sold 59+ hyper-casual games for US$35,000 in 2019.<p>We are building our relationship with friendly publishers, and 10+ publishers expressed their interest.<p>We are at a super early stage. It would be a privilege to get some feedback.",
