      "text": "This is kind of a weird topic, maybe a gut feeling, maybe it&#x27;s not even true. It looks to me that the PC, as a computer platform, has died and ceased to be interesting and exciting.<p>There is plenty of evidence for this fact:<p>* At https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fileforum.com (previously betanews) people used to write comments, the site was active - now ... no one comments on anything at all - a ton of apps don&#x27;t have comments updated for over 10 years\n* At http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.majorgeeks.com all sorts of new software used to emerge for different tasks all the time - now the site is almost dead, rare updates of this and that\n* New versions of Windows were indeed new, not some dull facelift of Windows 10 -&gt; 11\n* People have long stopped caring about software versions - if it works it&#x27;s okay. There used to be some genuine excitement when this or that new version of software was released.\n* With the appearance of a good built-in AV in Windows the issue of viruses has ceased to be important and barely anyone talks about the topic\n* The activity on software forums has dropped dramatically, but the number of people in the world is not getting any smaller.<p>Is the PC and software market dead? Or the explosive growth of the industry has simply stopped and people are lazily waiting for new ... games, because all the current software fully satisfies them?<p>What do you think?",
