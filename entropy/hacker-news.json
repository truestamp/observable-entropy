This has made me smile a couple of times when the insult is really good.<p>Is there other examples of software that insults you when you get something wrong&#x2F;do something incorrect?<p>This list can serve a double-purpose: first as a recommendation list for us who like to get insulted for fun, and second as a list of software to avoid for the ones that don&#x27;t like it.",

      "text": "My Macbook is a complete mess, and I’m often in strange situations when somone approaches my desk or during a meeting, because my desktop is unorganized with icons , there are constantly several windows open, and I was frequently chatting in the conference while on mute.<p>I needed a solution where I could tidy up the desktop icons by concealing them, or hide all windows except the one I was presently working on, or turn on or off the microphone with a single click without having to seek for it.<p>I&#x27;ve been searching through different tools to see if there&#x27;s anything that could fix this problem. While I&#x27;ve found a few, many of them are pricey, so I figured why not build one myself.<p>Here is where Zen mode comes in, with a single click you can hide desktop icons, hide inactive windows, mute mic or speakers.<p>You can watch a quick intro to the tool here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;wT2PdPg-RZo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;wT2PdPg-RZo</a><p>You can download the mac app here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zen-mode.carrd.co&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zen-mode.carrd.co&#x2F;</a><p>Any feedback is highly appreciated. Thank you!",
