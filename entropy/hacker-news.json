This should be a solution that can work for (most) any kind of web app.<p>I think my default would be\nFrontend: React;\nBackend: Google cloud functions;\nData: Firestore;\nInfra: Firebase<p>But tbh it still takes much longer &#x2F; more effort to spin up a web app with moderate functionality than it does to create a shopify store.<p>Maybe these aren&#x27;t the best &#x2F; most up to date tools. I&#x27;d love to hear what other people think is best.",
