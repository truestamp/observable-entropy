There&#x27;s promising work being done in the field namely by Dr. Keith Jerome and Fred Hutch and a Chinese Pharmaceutical company BD Gene.<p>These companies are working on a therapeutic vaccine that could help cure the 2&#x2F;3s of the US population from the disease. \nWhat would it take to find and reach out to investors or philanthropist to help fund these types of works.<p>The market for a cure is lucrative no doubt, are there any organisations out there that would donate purely based on a philanthropist nature?",
