I get a message when I swipe my bank card, a one time password every time I login for certain services along with birthday messages and other marketing material. This is just to name a few. Alot of these messages have some pretty sensitive information. I don&#x27;t have the discipline to delete all these messages but I am wondering if anyone has automated their SMS messages. I am on an android phone and use the stock standard Messages app.",
