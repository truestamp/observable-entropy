      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m currently taking a sabbatical from work but I&#x27;m planning to start looking for something new in March. I&#x27;ve seen services like those from levels.fyi for resume review and salary negotiation and I&#x27;m curious about whether doing so would be worthwhile for me.<p>Have you used either or both of these types of services? If so, who provided the service? How much did it cost? Do you feel like it was worth the money you paid?<p>For context, I have over 20 years of development experience, with about 10 in technical lead positions. I&#x27;m going to be looking for either an IC position at a level above senior (lead, staff, principal) or a combined IC&#x2F;management position that manages a team of engineers and also has technical leadership responsibilities. If you&#x27;ve used these services for a similar level please note that in your response, since that will be extra relevant.<p>Thank you for your input!<p>(Note: I&#x27;m not linking to my resume because I don&#x27;t want this to seem like I&#x27;m trawling for free resume review on the sly!)",
