Phone usage is becoming the standard now and less people even know what a file is. I&#x27;ve noticed that this also applies at freshmen at colleges.<p>So, without being catastrophic and pessimistic about the future, it is undoubtedly true that programming and coding requires a decent knowledge of the desktop UI&#x2F;UX and of basic PC functionalities. While the IT markets growing, the set of people with those skills seems to be shrinking, even between those studying coding&#x2F;engineering.<p>So how do you envision the future of coding in the next 10 years? How do you think this will affect the job market and the available technologies?",
