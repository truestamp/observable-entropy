Looking for recommendations of books, articles, frameworks, etc that can help me to prepare. It&#x27;s a product leadership role so I&#x27;ll have to come up with a 30-60-90+ day plan or something like that. I&#x27;m interested in materials that are specific to product or are more general leadership or management focused. Thanks for any suggestions.",
