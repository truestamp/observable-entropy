      "text": "I am curious if this is possible, and if it is, I would like to know whether there is plugin that already exists or if there is an API or SDK I can look into.<p>I want to be able to record and replay the last 30 seconds of my browser activity. I know there are manual tools to do this where I click a button and it starts recording my browser activity. That is not what I want. I just want a plugin that sits in the back and continously keeps the last 30sec of any session so that I whenever at any point I click replay, it will playback the last 30 seconds of my session.<p>I am also thinking of just building it if it doesn&#x27;t exist and would be glad to hear what kind of APIs I should look into. I have done plenty of development but I have not done any browser extensions.",
