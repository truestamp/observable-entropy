      "text": "I created a free website that pairs Philips Hue lights with NBA games<p>I just released a beta version of a site that allows you to connect your   hue lights to live basketball games.  Say the Miami Heat are playing  the  Los Angeles Lakers -- As the Heat start to take a big lead, the  room  will grow more and more red in real time.<p>I originally made this app just for myself so that I could ambiently  follow along with basketball games in the background while my partner and I watch movies, but I started using it during games and it turned out to really enhance the experience of watching.<p>Looking for anyone to try it out and give me some feedback!<p>Note:  This doesn&#x27;t play nicely on mobile currently unless you tell your   internet browser to allow pop-ups.  The first time you use this site,   you will be warned in a pop-up that there is an insecure connection and   you will have to click through that message and accept before returning   to the site. This is due to something on the Hue API side.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basketball.lighting",
