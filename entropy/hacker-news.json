      "text": "During the start of the year I was thinking how could I bet against certain stocks (in my case mainly Tesla) without using derivatives and the risks that come with them.<p>After I had success betting on the oil price with a highly correlated investment fond, I came to the conclusion that negative correlations could be used to bet against the price of other assets. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find correlations between assets if you don&#x27;t know which assets to compare in the first place.<p>So I created a website where you can find the 10 highest and 10 lowest correlations of certain assets.",
