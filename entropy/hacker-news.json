At that point, I couldn&#x27;t see it in incognito windows, but I could still edit and delete it. So far everything made sense. A few minutes after that, &quot;[flagged]&quot; went away and I could see it in incognito windows again, but now I can&#x27;t edit or delete it anymore, even though I&#x27;m still well within the 2-hour window. What happened here?",
