      "text": "I was going through the paper [Password Security: A Case History][1] By Robert Morris and Ken Thompson on authentication. It has been mentioned in the <i>First Scheme</i> that the first encryption used m209, in which they used the user password as the key.<p>The respective excerpt is,<p>&gt; Most of the standard encryption methods used (in the past) for\n&gt; encryption of messages are rather easy to invert. A convenient and\n&gt; rather good encryption program happened to exist on the system at the\n&gt; time; it simulated the M-209 cipher machine [1] used by the U.S. Army\n&gt; during World War II. It turned out that the M-209 program was usable,\n&gt; but with a given key, the ciphers produced by this program are trivial\n&gt; to invert. It is a much more difficult matter to find out the key\n&gt; given the cleartext input and the enciphered output of the program.\n&gt; Therefore, the password was used not as the text to be encrypted but\n&gt; as the key, and a constant was encrypted using this key. The encrypted\n&gt; result was entered into the password file.<p>As read through the m209 further, seems like the key wheel can have 6 wheels, in which we can set&#x2F;unset a specific alphabet.<p>There are some constraints here,\n- Only alphabets can be used in the key.\n- They are case insensitive.\n- Not all the wheels contain all the alphabets that are needed.<p>Given these constraints, any idea what were the constraints on the passwords imposed by the first generation encryption of the password?<p><pre><code>  [1]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;citeseerx.ist.psu.edu&#x2F;viewdoc&#x2F;download?doi=10.1.1.128.1635&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</code></pre>",
