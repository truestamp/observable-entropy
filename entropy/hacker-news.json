What&#x27;s is like when you believe so much in your product, market, however, it needs a little breathe for it to catapult into the next level?<p>I&#x27;m so much in love with YC and what they stand for, can&#x27;t believe i refresh my emails waiting to \nmy first interview email, lol.<p>It&#x27;s an experience what telling, my startup is solving a problem - anomaly detection for companies.<p>I recall sometime post facebook era, i wanted to build a facebook chat-like version for businesses, then came SLACK, Trello etc....we couldn&#x27;t lift the product up then. I knew there was a market for it which has been proved right.<p>This time around, am building another interesting product that will help businesses accelerate decision making process without the need for ML engineers. Crazy right? we are automating AI.<p>I just thought to pour out my heart here, keep building.<p>What&#x27;s your experience like?",
