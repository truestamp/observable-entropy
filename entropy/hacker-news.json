Is HN becoming more of an &quot;echo chamber&quot;?<p>2. If yes[2], how big of an &quot;echo chamber&quot; you think HN has become (or is becoming)?<p>3. How wide spread this issue? Is it only certain topic specific? If yes, what are those topics?<p>Note:<p>I find it quite ironic that I&#x27;m asking this question on HN while knowing that one can&#x27;t rely too much on the received responses. Still, IMHO, HN is the best place for asking this HN specific question than any other place on the internet (at this moment).<p>---<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30347719<p>[2] - To some extent, I accept that all online social platform are inherently kind of an &quot;echo chamber&quot;, in a very specific sense. However, I could not be alone here expecting a little more from the majority of HN users (compared to users of other online social platforms, like Reddit) when it comes to the issue of an &quot;echo chamber&quot; and its corresponding negative effects.",
