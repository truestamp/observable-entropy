Yes, this seems extremely unlikely, but as a thought experiment, what would come next?<p>Given the impact and implications this would have:<p>- How would anyone even go about publishing anything like this without literally breaking the world?<p>- Would this actually break the world?<p>- What if they were malicious?

I am not sure we are even remotely close to being set up to handle something like this.<p>What do you think?",
