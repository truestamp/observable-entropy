If I have a set of machines behind a firewall, it is a huge pain to setup a qbittorrent instance and configure clients to use it, and even once that is setup the retrieval process is nothing like &quot;wget magnet:&#x2F;&#x2F;...&quot;.<p>To be clear, projects like aria2 (C++) and webtorrent (nodejs) do exist, but try to seriously use them and you&#x27;ll find they are slow to get started and overall unreliable.",
