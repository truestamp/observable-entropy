      "text": "Hi there,<p>We are deprecating the Vercel Free plan. On May 12, 2022, you will be automatically moved to our Pro Plan.<p>Our Pro Plan is $20 per user per month, includes up to 1TB of Bandwidth, and supports the ultimate development &amp; collaboration workflow. Of course, you can always change or upgrade plans by contacting us.<p>Your projects will be transferred to Pro with zero downtime. The only way this change will affect your project is if your application depends on Serverless Functions with timeouts longer than 60 seconds, or is dependent on being deployed to multiple regions—these options are not available for new deployments on the Pro plan.<p>Keep in mind—you&#x27;ll receive 1TB of bandwidth, 1TB of function execution, and 5,000 source images included in your plan. Concerned about overages? Learn more about pricing here.<p>Feel free to reply with any questions or read more about it here.<p>Happy Developing,\nThe Vercel Team",
