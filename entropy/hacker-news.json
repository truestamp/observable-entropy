      "text": "I know some folks have worked remotely for years, but a vast number of us are coming up on 2 years of working remotely instead of being in the office 5 days a week.  Life is different now, but not as I expected.  And I also don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m as good at it as I expected.<p>Looking back to the days before I worked remotely, it sounded amazing - no commute, no dress code, no obnoxious cube neighbors, etc.  And those aspects of remote work haven&#x27;t disappointed.<p>On the other hand, I always felt like if I was working from home I&#x27;d find ways to exercise while working and I&#x27;d work on language learning by immersing myself in foreign language audio (news, music, podcasts, whatever).<p>Neither of these panned out.  Maybe partially because my work projects have been extra-demanding, maybe partially because I don&#x27;t multi-task&#x2F;context-shift well.<p>What remote work dreams didn&#x27;t come true for you (or alternatively, how did you make your remote work dreams come true)?",
