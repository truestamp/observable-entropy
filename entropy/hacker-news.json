      "text": "I am building an app that allows players to participate in challenges in Dark Souls: Remastered game.<p>The challenge is essentially a task to beat a specific boss in the game. Each challenge has a time limit and maximum number of deaths limit. Once a player is done with the challenge, the app will evaluate their progress and decide if they are successful.<p>The app just went public in Microsoft Store: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;9P0K868XDXTS<p>Currently it has a limited functionality to introduce you to the idea and collect feedback to determine where to go next. One path I am currently considering is to move towards paid challenges. In this concept, each challenge could have a player-defined fee to join. Total could then be equally distributed among all winners.<p>Being a competitive gamer myself, I know I wouldn&#x27;t really use the app if all challenges were free. To be really hooked, I need an adrenaline booster - and challenge participation fee is exactly that - at least for me.<p>If the idea sounds interesting to you, please try the app and share your thoughts - that could really help me move forward and hopefully build the app that fans of Souls-like games would really want.<p>P.S. Of course I&#x27;ll be moving to Elden Ring once the game is out.",
