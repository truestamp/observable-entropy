      "text": "It seems like we go through this cycle where $STARTUP gets some viral fanfare with a genuinely good product or service, then eventually as they grow to a large size, they are no longer able to have humans in the filtering process, and as a result use algorithms that end up banning normal users with no recourse unless it gets posted to Twitter or HN.<p>Also, is this okay? Is this just what we have settled on? Is there an effect where once a service or product has got so big that random people are sacrificed to the algorithm that they are too big for people to quit? Facebook, Amazon, Google, no matter how many times people get burned, they seem to remain wildly popular, which indicates either this is not a problem or it is acceptable behavior or every user thinks &quot;it wont be me&quot;<p>Is there a name for this effect? Are there any articles I can read to help me hate and avoid this practice more effectively?",

      "text": "Ive been playing destiny 2 for about a month,i will continue to play it but will never spend a cent on it,because i dont like helping greedy companies like bungie,for an ftp game, i haven got any good content till now,everything is paid. The experience is limited,and because i wont pay there will be less destiny playtime for me,so im looking for another game to fill that time, so do you guys know of any good xbox games that are not pay to win?idc if the game is free or paid,what i care about is,when i play it,i wont feel that those with more money have an advantage over me in game. So whats your recommendations?",
