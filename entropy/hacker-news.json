      "text": "I am looking for a cool domain name, mostly for personal email and blogs. It should also be short and easy to spell, and most importantly, reliable in the long term. I don&#x27;t want to lose it in 10 or 20 years because some random country where the domain is based in decides to take it away from me or some other political issues.<p>Are only the traditional ones (.com, .net, .org) good for this purpose? For example .me is cool but it is the official TLD for Montenegro, or .ai which is for Anguilla. What about .xyz or .space? Can I rely on them?<p>Also feel free to suggest reliable registries.<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I have recently came across [0] and loved the idea. I wrote a script that plays the tron game (bikes leaving a line of light behind). My script got me through to the place 486th out of 6790. I&#x27;m fascinated about this idea and would like to use the motivation momentum and study the subject, can you suggest good books on this field?<p>I&#x27;d like to tackle more complex environments too where bot have to make decision between different strategies to maximize the chance to win (situations where you can chose between collecting and spending resources, defending, attacking). They had a contest [1] a few days ago where player was controlling 3 heroes to defend against spiders and other players. So I think it&#x27;s not something I can solve with some fancy version of min-max?<p>I have run search on amazon and found a few picks, I would love to get some worthy recommendations..<p>* Game Hacking: Developing Autonomous Bots for Online Games by Nick Cano [2]<p>* Game AI Pro 360: Guide to Tactics and Strategy by Steve Rabin [3]<p>* 75 pages of results when searching for Game Theory [4]<p>--refs--<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codingame.com&#x2F;multiplayer&#x2F;bot-programming&#x2F;line-racing<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codingame.com&#x2F;contests&#x2F;spring-challenge-2022<p>[2] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;Game-Hacking-Developing-Autonomous-Online&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1593276699&#x2F;ref=sr_1_5?crid=ONIHKGSP235&amp;keywords=bot&amp;qid=1651565248&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=bot%2Cstripbooks%2C91&amp;sr=1-5<p>[3] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;Game-AI-Pro-360-Strategy&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0367150883&#x2F;ref=sr_1_21?crid=3RPZIO8W1MJ2I&amp;keywords=game+bot&amp;qid=1651565682&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=game+bot%2Cstripbooks%2C90&amp;sr=1-21<p>[4] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;s?k=game+theory&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;crid=1DSAWKMLM9G7A&amp;sprefix=game+theory%2Cstripbooks%2C106&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1",
