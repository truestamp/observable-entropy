Did you need to convert the string like &quot;1day1minute 20 seconds&quot;<p>GitHub - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Animatea&#x2F;aiotense\nDocumentation - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;animatea.github.io&#x2F;aiotense&#x2F;<p>aiotense is a tool that converts a string like &quot;1day1minute 20seconds&quot; into number of seconds or timedelta objects.\n- If you need case insensitivity, you can use resolvers. \n- Custom parsing sequence - custom resolvers.\n- Need to convert result to string? You can write your own converter by inheriting `aiotense.application.ports.converters.AbstractConverter`.\n- Need to cache the result? Write your own parser by inheriting `aiotense.application.ports.parsers.AbstractParser`.<p>aiotense has been designed with maximum flexibility, practicality and user friendliness in mind. I hope our project helped you or you were just interested in seeing it.",
