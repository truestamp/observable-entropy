Such products might look interesting at the beginning, but I&#x27;m sure many tried and many failed, hence I want to understand:<p>1. Who are the customers of no-code products?<p>2. Do these customers stay in the long-term?<p>3. What are the top challenges that killed such startups?<p>4. In 5 years time, would we have more and significantly successful no-code products?<p>5. At what extent a customer might prefer a no-code tool over signing a contract with consultancy?",
