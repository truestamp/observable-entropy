      "text": "It has become very common for iPhone users to apply a screen protector right after unboxing. However, it is not unusual to receive a faulty iPhone even if it is brand new nowadays. If customers apply a screen protector to the new iPhone that happens to be faulty, is Apple responsible to compensate customers for the screen protector?<p>My local (UK) apple store dismissed my request because the screen protector was not purchased from apple store. But I believe this is not justified because the phone is faulty and Apple should compensate for customer’s loss, i.e, the screen protector. Can any readers here tell me if I am right or not? Any help would be appreciated.",
