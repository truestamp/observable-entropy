      "text": "When I first read something using the term &quot;doomscrolling&quot; or &quot;scroll of doom&quot;, my brain formed an understanding of it that focuses on the &quot;scrolling&quot;, characterized by doom, as in being doomed to an eternal never-ending scrolling through something. Just like what the modern web afflicts onto its users.<p>Texts that used the term seemed to make sense with that definition.<p>These days &quot;doomscrolling&quot; is making big media headlines, and the definition media uses seems to focus on &quot;doom&quot; as in browsing bad news, and the &quot;scrolling&quot; part does not even fit the context. At least assuming simply scrolling would not only provide unwanted (unconsciously desired) bad news, but &quot;doomscrolling&quot; according to that definition would require some slightly more active form of consumption, like following links that fit the theme or explicit searches.<p>Was my understanding wrong in the first place, or is it a case of &quot;hacker&quot; once more? What is your definition?",
