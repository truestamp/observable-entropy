      "text": "I&#x27;m a serial project-starter but I&#x27;m awful at finishing. I&#x27;m constantly full of ideas for things to work on&#x2F;learn about outside of work. I&#x27;ll start new projects at the weekend and by the following weekend I&#x27;ll have completely lost interest, having found something else. This is often a cycle.<p>I feel I could do great things if I could only find the focus to finish them.<p>This extends beyond &quot;projects&quot; to many of aspects of my life: my job, dating, music etc; I go through short phases of being very excited about something only to feel complete apathy towards it days or weeks later. I&#x27;ve even struggled to find the motivation to finish my CV lately despite having a job I despise.<p>I&#x27;ve wondered whether there&#x27;s something about my brain chemistry that causes this (which I appreciate is a very 21st century attitude to have) but I&#x27;m curious as to whether anyone else has experienced anything like this? A constant shifting in your interests&#x2F;motivation to the point where it&#x27;s impossible to finish (or be really good at) anything. It makes it very difficult to feel I&#x27;m using my time well.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been thinking of ways to sandbox development-related programs&#x2F;processes&#x2F;data on the MacOS. A primary use case is to protect the whole system from the, for example, malicious NPM library. I&#x27;m aware that there is some application sandboxing built-in into the MacOS. However, I don&#x27;t know to what extent it covers this use case.<p>For this discussion, let&#x27;s consider full-fledged IDE, like IntelliJ Idea, and skip remote development using VSCode&#x2F;CLI editor over SSH&#x2F;TRAMP&#x2F;Projector. Also, examine a case where we would like to run multiple different applications inside the same sandbox for a specific project (e.g., IntelliJ + iTerm).<p>Please focus on the MacOS — I already know how to solve this issue on Linux.",
