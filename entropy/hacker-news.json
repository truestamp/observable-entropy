      "text": "I&#x27;m playing around doing leetcode challenges for fun where I stumbled upon one which required quicksort. It struck me then that I&#x27;ve completely forgotten how to implement it (which I once did a couple of years ago at uni), I had to go to wikipedia and write it from pseudo code. All in all it took me about 30 min to solve.<p>This got me thinking; is this even an issue? Is there value in knowing algorithms like quicksort and Djikstra&#x27;s by heart, as opposed to being confident that you&#x27;re able to implement them given information on how to do it?",
