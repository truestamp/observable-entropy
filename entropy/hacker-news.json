      "text": "I&#x27;ve been looking through a legacy code base recently and have observed a perennial question come into my mind:<p>What makes software great?<p>Of course it needs to work for it intended purpose.  But that alone does not make great software.  That is merely table stakes.<p>The more I work in this industry the more I think the main thing that defines greatness is:<p>Is the code easy to understand?<p>Of courses there is subjectivity in even this, but could a reasonably intelligent developer easy see what is going on in a codebase, even as it grows sufficiently large.<p>Empathy is a superpower here.  How much are you thinking about the poor souls that will follow in your footsteps and be asked to build upon your foundation?<p>I know this is a complex topic with plenty of subjectivity.  But I am curious what your thoughts are here.<p>What makes software great?",
