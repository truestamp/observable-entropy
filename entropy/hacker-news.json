Its super interesting and I want to dip my toes into some C++. I was wondering if you guys could point me towards any resources to learn more about C++ compilers&#x2F;optimization.<p>I can write C++ pretty well (DS&#x2F;Algos&#x2F;STL library) but my systems exposure is limited to Arduino&#x2F;C and trying to write a hobby OS in Rust. Is there anything in particular you guys think I should focus on when it comes to the rest of the stack, besides just C++?",
