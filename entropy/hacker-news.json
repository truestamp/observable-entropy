Everyday I wakeup thinking  to do something but later before bed the same thought hit again and again that i couldnt do anything. I tried to explore many things and tried to meet many people to match my interest and for ideas . Its not that i didnt came with any idea , but the ideas im caming up with does match my skillset or sometimes it may be too expensive.<p>bUT the  struggle will be kept going until i  wake up and end this dream and make a reality.",
