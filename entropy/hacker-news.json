I&#x27;m by no stretch an expert, but I feel that I have a firm foundation.<p>I intended to learn back-end development before applying for jobs, but I&#x27;ve heard that nobody hires junior full stack developers.<p>Is this true in your experience? Should I learn any back-end, just get really good at React, or learn some other web technology? Any other advice re: getting my first dev job would be hugely appreciated.<p>Thanks in advance!",
