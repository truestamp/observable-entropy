      "text": "Hi all,<p>For my entire career (15+ years) I’ve worked at startups as a designer who codes. I really enjoy the startup scene, wearing multiple hats, and shipping quickly.<p>The older I get though, the more the opportunity cost of not joining a FAANG type is weighing on my mind financially.<p>I’ve never applied to one of these companies, and while I know my skill set is incredibly valuable to startups where urgency and velocity are important, I’ve wondered if I could even be hired at a much larger company where urgency seems less critical, and roles seem more specialized… I’m sure I could apply as only a designer or front end dev, but I really enjoy both and would hate to give one up.<p>If you work at one of these companies, have you ever worked with a colleague who does both? or do you? And if so, how was the experience?<p>Thank you!",
