      "text": "My team received application written in Python 2.7.\nOld team members are retired and not available for any questions.<p>Following technologies are used in project:<p>* Django<p>* SQLAlchemy<p>* XML-RPC<p>* Jinja<p>* Springpython<p>* Pyro.<p>The application is using PostgreSQL as database and has about 150.000 lines of code. (mostly backend, UI is really simple)<p>We are tasked to modernize whole tech stack (migrate to Python 3) and fix couple bugs (rated from the previous team with both priority and severity low)<p>Most of the team members have zero experience with Python and  have zero knowledge in business domain of this new application. We can not hire additional people. Considering how much will cost us in time&#x2F;money to update this code base to Python3 I am somehow more on the line to migrate to the tech stack that we are already using for all other projects.<p>I found a lot writing on topic Python to GO, but on Python to Java&#x2F;C# not so much. Are there any success stories with described best practices during rewrite?",
