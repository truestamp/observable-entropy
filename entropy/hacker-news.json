      "text": "I work in the capacity of a Hiring Manager in a fairly large Software organization. We have a few Engineer positions open, and we are hiring aggressively. The issue I am facing is that, the resumes are filled with junk more than ever and are seemingly fake in one look itself. But we need candidates, and are forced to accept the resumes, and schedule for a first round and reject.<p>There was this 5 yr. experienced candidate, whose resume was sent to us by a preferred sourcing vendor, had 80+ technologies listed in the resume. In one scan we knew it was fake, but nevertheless spent 15 mins on an online first round to reject.<p>Is there a free service or product which I can use to find \n1) whether the resume is fake (based on any AI algorithms)\n2) Determine if the resume is fake based on how many keywords are randomnly distributed across the resume\n3) Find how many unique technologies are listed, how many are repeated, and things like that.<p>I tried Standford Named Entity Recognizer[1] to pick some keywords from the text, but the online demo allows only certain text to be scanned.<p>1 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlp.stanford.edu&#x2F;software&#x2F;CRF-NER.html",
