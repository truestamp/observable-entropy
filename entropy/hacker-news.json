      "text": "Hey Everyone,<p>It&#x27;s Firat from Permify. We have been building things for quite a while with my co-founders. We have failed a couple of times as well. Building so many products, we realized we had problem with a repetitive and overlooked part of product development.<p>-Authorizations &amp; Access Control-<p>It&#x27;s been a problem to manage roles, permissions, and access control for our apps. Whether it&#x27;s for subscription tiers, or complex role management.<p>There are 4 main reasons we frustrated;<p>1. Overwhelming to build complex &amp; flexible access control.<p>2. User needs changes quickly.<p>3. Building access control is repetitive most of the time.<p>4. Maintenance is important, and usually overlooked.<p>While working on full time with client projects, features and daily work. It was almost impossible to focus on access control. Also there are dozens of great solutions for Authentication, but not much for Authorizations. So, That&#x27;s why we built Permify, it&#x27;s an plug-&amp;-play authorizations API, that makes your apps flexible with future-proof access control. Whether it&#x27;s for custom roles, permissions, or subscription tier management.<p>With Permify you can;<p>- Built Authorizations &amp; Access Control in minutes.<p>- Create customer roles in seconds.<p>- We have hosted UI where you can give your users an admin panel for custom roles.<p>- Gate UI layers &amp; Different Components on your apps for different subscription tiers.<p>You can try Permify for free without a credit card, and we have a free tier as well :)<p>I always love HN, yeah I had times when people were rude etc. But usually I found people willing give their best opinions and help me. So feel free to reach me out at firat@permify.co if you need higher plan, I can offer up to 6 months free trial for higher tiers. (Thanks to our AWS credits)<p>Here&#x27;s the link:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;permify.co",
