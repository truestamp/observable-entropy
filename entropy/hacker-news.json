I lack time, and moreover, if I actually want to reach a non-trivial level of skills in a particular tech, I have to spend serious amount of time, abandoning other wishes&#x2F;ideas.<p>So, my question is- is the Crypto tech, like blockchain, worth learning? Will there be applications beyond decentralised finance, web3, etc.?<p>Will learning the tech make me a better &quot;technologist&quot; in any way?<p>I want to be clear: I do not want to buy or own cryptocoins. Web3 does not look interesting to me at this point.<p>Should I still learn about blockchains?",
