      "text": "Hi everyone! For the past year I&#x27;ve been working on a simple LDAP server for user management, targeted at self-hosted servers.<p>The idea is that OpenLDAP is a pain to install, configure and manage, and on top of that you need a frontend if you want a web UI.<p>LDAP instead provides a minimalistic LDAP server that supports the subset of LDAP needed for user management and authentication, with almost no configuration required, and a nice UI&#x2F;API in front of it.<p>We just released version 0.4 (and 0.3 actually) and it should now be stable enough to use it yourself!<p>We&#x27;ve had some people using it for tests as well.",
