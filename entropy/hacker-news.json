      "text": "Hi, I recently made a CLI tool that&#x27;s similar to `make`, but geared towards servers. There&#x27;s tons of software in this category (Ansible, Chef, Salt, Sup, etc.), but most of them are geared towards production-grade server management, which is a bit overkill I think when you&#x27;re just doing some `apt install &lt;package&gt;` or `sudo systemctl start &lt;unit&gt;` for your hobby projects. With this in mind, sake was born.",
