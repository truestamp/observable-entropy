He was very interested in hearing about the experiences of founders and remote workers, and what needs to be done to help the local startup ecosystem. As the chair of the standing committee on migration, I think he would be looking for some quick wins before the election for his party (he&#x27;s in a safe seat).<p>So in the light of \nhttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;foundervisa.html\nwhat should we as a startup community be asking for?<p>What new visas should be created? What should the criteria be for them?<p>(If you aren&#x27;t in Australia, what would help you want to come to Australia to build your startup here?)",
