Might be despite my STEM degree I&#x27;m not good enough, but the lack of interviews I&#x27;m landing means I&#x27;m being filtered out from the start.<p>The way people make it out to be here, those jobs are handed out.<p>So are companies BSing? HN comments BSing? or who is getting these URM jobs?<p>Does anyone have any advice or willing to provide some mentorship?<p>Thanks, on a throw away because this is embarrassing.",

      "text": "Hey HN, Alex and Ben here, and we wanted to share a simple web app we created recently: UIFiller.com[0]<p>UI Filler is a quick way to get placeholders for your designs.<p>We do a lot of UI design and development and frequently need to fill it with placeholder content. I usually just Google “Lorem ipsum” and end up on a site about the history of lorem ipsum, then copy and paste some small chunk of it to fill the field I need. Ben, who is even more design-oriented than I am, tries to make up appropriate text to fill fields (my favorite thing he does is placeholder names, like “Anita McLaren”). We decided to make a tool that would save us a bit of time every time we needed a placeholder, so we built UIFiller.<p>Let me know what you think!<p>[0] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;uifiller.com",

      "text": "Today we ask for your support in ending a lobbying campaign that threatens to make Starlink unusable for you and the vast majority of our American customers.<p>As recently reported, DISH Network has been hoarding spectrum for years as a strategy for preventing open and fair competition.<p>Most recently, DISH has been attempting to claim new rights to the 12 GHz band, which is the spectrum you currently use to download content with Starlink. Despite technical studies dating back as far as 2016 that refute the basis of their claims, DISH has employed paid lobbyists who are attempting to mislead the FCC with faulty analysis in hopes of obscuring the truth.<p>In reality, if DISH gets their way, Starlink customers will experience harmful interference more than 77% of the time and total outage of service 74% of the time, rendering Starlink unusable for most Americans. You can read the details here.<p>The FCC and your members of Congress have the power to stop this effort, but they need to hear from you.",
