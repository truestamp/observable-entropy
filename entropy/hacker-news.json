How did you go about it? Any tips, advice, suggestions, warnings?",

      "text": "I live in Redmond and work at Microsoft. I&#x27;m 38 and have a family. I&#x27;m an &quot;SRE&quot; with a security clearance working on government cloud stuff. Mostly DevOps type work, but using tools that are pretty awful (running production systems on Windows, no linux or kubernetes etc).<p>I&#x27;ve been interviewing lately because I really don&#x27;t enjoy the product and tech I&#x27;m working on. My work life balance is pretty good, very short commute and my on-call is just tedious boring shit during the day. I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> been paged outside of work hours in 2 years.<p>I have two offers (Seattle)<p>Current total comp at Microsoft is ~250k<p>AWS: $300k L5 Cloud Engineer - working on internal build&#x2F;development tools for the government clouds:  Manager says 2am pages will happen, and the team works 45-50 hours per week by his estimation.<p>Oracle: $325k (no benefits, W-2 contract). Sounds like I would be working with linux, kubernetes, java, python and doing DevOps for some data science platform. While I&#x27;m contracting, there are some work&#x2F;life balance gaurdrails beacuse &gt;40 hours means I get paid (same rate $156.25&#x2F;hr).<p>In all 3 scenarios, on-call requires trip to secure facility to work on the issue. At MSFT this has been a non-issue for me because the product is only really used in the day.<p>Most people have said &quot;Stay at Microsoft for life&quot; even if the pay is less.<p>AWS promises the most career growth (?) and RSU upside, probably at the cost of work&#x2F;life balance which at my age is precious to me.<p>Everyone is saying don&#x27;t take the Oracle contract, but the work sounds most interesting to me, and it seems pretty chill from the people I have talked to.<p>Everyone on &quot;BLIND&quot; says AWS is absolute hell, unless you luck out on team&#x2F;manager.<p>Advice from the non-blind crowd?<p>Thanks!",
