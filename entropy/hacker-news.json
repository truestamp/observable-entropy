      "text": "I&#x27;m very curious and excited at the rise of web app development. I think it truly represents the concept of Write Once Run Anywhere, it gives common people easier access to software, and promotes the idea of a web browser as a user environment.<p>What I don&#x27;t like is how much of a mess web app development is. It seems like things are growing more complex, which is great for high profile projects, but the browser should also be for amateurs. Does anyone know of any frameworks that operate similar to WinForms where the user can just drag controls onto a template, bind events, etc? If not, it would be a great idea.",
