The fact that she did it without consulting me (the “computer guy” of the family, with an actual career in technology) is what bothers me the most: either she had no idea that this was a risky investment and thus did not think it was relevant to even ask me, or she knew it and actively avoided my opinion. Both situations are alarming. (What I actually think happened was that some kind of enthusiast friend convinced her.) How would you go about showing someone you love the dangers and harsh reality about crypto investments?",
