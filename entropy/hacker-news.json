      "text": "Recently I had to decide if we would be using traditional paper business cards or something different (and perhaps even eco friendly). It seems that in Europe and especially parts of Asia people still expect business cards and not alternatives... some we thought of were:<p>Card with info printed on but also on nf and as a qr code (or with fancy conductive ink)<p>Goodies like USB Sticks&#x2F;cards with pre prepared stuff<p>Useful everyday items like... aluminium Multitool cards, post it, bottle openers (not great for formal settings) or whatnot<p>Coins, wooden forms, alu poker chips and other alternative shapes and materials<p>Nothing-&gt; exchange via mobile<p>Anyone has experiences or ideas on alternatives that engage?",
