I do all engineering, sales, marketing, etc. I often find myself giving demos to people (or teams) and every time I feel like the demo sucked.<p>I have tried creating demo scripts, reading public speaking books, sales books, etc. My demos must not suck too much because I still get sales but I can&#x27;t help but feel like I could do better and give a better &quot;wow&quot; factor when seeing the product in action.<p>Anyone ever feel this way and have advice?",
