      "text": "I know something is happening with Google accounts entering a new level of security Friday. I don&#x27;t know what is involved, and I&#x27;ve heard rumors this includes things like shutting down IMAP&#x2F;POP3 access to GMail. Can someone explain, because my Googling skills, ironically, have failed and I feel like I&#x27;m hearing the results of 10 levels of signal corruption like through a game of telephone.<p>The only thing I&#x27;m fairly sure of is that it in some way relates to third-party apps. But I don&#x27;t even know if that means people who use alternative email clients or apps who use Google OAuth2. I also heard that iPhone based accounts have a longer period of time, but that also seems possible.<p>Thanks.",
