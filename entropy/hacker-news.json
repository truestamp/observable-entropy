      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;m depressed and judging by posts as of late (see below), chances are, so are you.<p>I go to talk therapy and it&#x27;s <i>okay</i>. Some sessions have been life saving. But the vast majority of my sessions frankly are a waste of time. The biggest waste of time - I feel - is frequently having to re-explain things. I wish I could go all &quot;omg rtfm&quot; to my therapist, but that&#x27;s not an option - being the nature of talk therapy and all.<p>Have any of you considered Email Therapy[1]? The idea being you don&#x27;t communicate with your therapist via spoken word (in person, phone call, zoom, etc.). Rather you communicate via written word (email, text, slack, or go full A. Ham with a written letter).<p>I see very little mention of it on HN over the years [2]. Therefore, I feel like it&#x27;s not a well known thing in the community. And shit, I&#x27;m right there with you, I have been going to talk therapy for 20 years and today is the first day I heard of Email Therapy.<p>I&#x27;m going to give it a try. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll ask my current therapist if they would like to convert to this form. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll be looking for therapists that do offer such a service.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Online_counseling\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=email%20therapy&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story<p>The posts as of late.
