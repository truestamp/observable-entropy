      "text": "It&#x27;s crazy, but this seems to be accurate from my limited experience:<p>1. Senior backend developer (~10 years of experience) trying to find a 100K Euro&#x2F;year job in Western Europe: quite hard if all you want to be is a simple &quot;individual contributor&quot; (employee, not contractor) writing $PROGRAMMING_LANG code without having to deal with k8s, the cloud, mentoring, or on-call paging. Besides, I&#x27;m not specially bright, just average, so I cannot pass tricky tech interviews. I&#x27;m currently making 85K Euro&#x2F;year (around 4600 Euro&#x2F;month after taxes) which is nice, but I cannot deal with the stress my current role (tech lead?) implies: I&#x27;m supposed to be on-call, to mentor junior engineers, to &quot;own&quot; our products, to learn more about devops&#x2F;infra topics, to bring and introduce new topics to my team, to be an example to engineers with less experience. All I want to do is to be part of a team pushing useful features for our customers: I don&#x27;t want to be on-call; I like to teach and learn from others but I don&#x27;t want to be a mentor; I want to write $PROGRAMMING_LANG code, I don&#x27;t want to setup the infra of our services... I want the job I had in 2010!\nNow, that&#x27;s for positions that pay ~85K euro&#x2F;year. Imagine the stress for positions that pay 100K. I don&#x27;t even think such positions (plain IC) exist in WE (excluding top companies ofc: I&#x27;m just the average Joe). It seems that this ~17% salary increase I&#x27;m looking for implies a 100% increase in stress. Nuts.<p>2. Getting a 50K euro&#x2F;year job in Western Europe is easy for someone like me with ~10 years of experience. I can pass the interviews just fine (I guess I would just have to hide some previous experience of mine so that I look like a junior to the companies). 50K euro&#x2F;year is around 3K&#x2F;month after taxes. Not bad. Now, the stress of a 50K euro&#x2F;year job is close to zero for someone with years of dev experience. Besides, you&#x27;ll get ton of free time because you know exactly how to do &quot;junior&quot; tasks! No on-call, no mentoring, no cloud, no k8s... just coding like it&#x27;s 2010!<p>Now, the big IF: what if I quit my current job and get 2x50K euro&#x2F;year jobs? That would mean (oversimplifying taxes) around 6K euro&#x2F;month after taxes (more than I would make earning 100K euro&#x2F;year!). I think I could do it just fine (perhaps I would have trouble with meetings at the same time). Low stress (because I would be a senior doing junior tasks), more money. Bingo. From an ethical point of view: I would be a junior (earning junior money) producing senior-level coding. That&#x27;s a big win for any company, no?<p>Now, coming back to reality: this is probably never going to happen.",
