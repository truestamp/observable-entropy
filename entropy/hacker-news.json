      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Nextcloud, which is not that great.  The text chat interface is confusing, installation was painful last time I did it, and the voice and video parts were hard to get working on my laptop.  I haven&#x27;t tried the phone apps.<p>I&#x27;d be using this mostly to talk to family, including my mom who is quite elderly and is thrown off a lot by interface elements changing, fonts changing, etc.  IRC is really better than any web chat app I know of, except it doesn&#x27;t keep scrollback when the client is disconnected.  It is important to be able to use text and video at the same time, since her hearing is poor so it&#x27;s better to type text that she can read.<p>My mom uses a Debian laptop that I set up for her, so if there&#x27;s a Linux desktop app that&#x27;s better than the web interface, that&#x27;s great.  She doesn&#x27;t use mobile phones at all.  I could imagine mobile apps also being worthwhile though, for users other than my mom.<p>I&#x27;ve tried the hosted version of Jitsi Meet (meet.jit.si) and it was nice.  I haven&#x27;t tried self-hosting it yet.  I&#x27;m happy to hear about experiences, and also about anything else interesting that is out there.<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "We just made a new IoT device based on cloud, that uses the Email protocols to communicate (it’s like a FAX but with more options, also it can connects to other IoTs using the LoRaWAN &amp; …); so because it will be in the intergovernmental or governmental office as an IoT device, in business plan, we need to complete the cyber-security issues; specially on protocols!\nSo after some months we are on launching section, then we found something strange about Quantum computers can hack the RSA 4096 encryption on emails! We can’t find the link on google now!\nI will appreciate that if you share us your opinions!\nThanks.",
