      "text": "The earliest known use of ECS, also known as FSD, communicated on port 669 with UDP datagrams.  Subsequent versions of the suicide ware used ephemeral ports, but the core code and algorithm were virtually identical to Port 669.  The word game terrorizes a socially-isolated person with a constant stream of false social interactions containing plain and coded hate speech.  The social pogrom continues until the target attempts suicide or is beaten and killed in an ambush.  If a target recovers from a suicide attempt or beating, the game starts again until the target is dead.<p>Happy Architects, the company behind the widely distributed app available at the BigChocolate and Pear app stores, is now the subject of a lawsuit in Santa Clara County, CA, contending that C-level executives themselves selected the targets from among the app&#x27;s users.  The Happy Architect legal team casts their defense as one of &quot;staunch advocacy for freedom of speech&quot;, and that mentally unstable shouldn&#x27;t use the app. The prosecution argues that generating mental instability in the target is the explicit purpose of the app, and that they have the receipts to prove that the C-level staff are complicit in a number of suicides and ghastly beatings and murders.",
