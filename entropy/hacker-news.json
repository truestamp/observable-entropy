Is there a good place to find such contracts outside of my LinkedIn network? Is something like agent for developer a thing? Kind of like authors, singer and actors have. I would love to hire someone like that, give him a cut of of contract and carry on. If it&#x27;s not a thing someone should make startup out of it.",
