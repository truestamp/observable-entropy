      "text": "In the 2010s there was a lot of doom and gloom about Moore&#x27;s Law being dead, and the need for new paradigms to speed up computers in the future. For instance, the following article from Technology Review:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;13&#x2F;245938&#x2F;moores-law-is-dead-now-what&#x2F;<p>However, it seems that this may have changed recently. ASML&#x27;s EUV lithography machines have been said to be able to reignite Moore&#x27;s law. It&#x27;s visible from a number of sources:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=asml+euv+moores+law<p>However, there&#x27;s a lot of hype and bullshit out there, and I can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s legit or not, so I turn to the knowledgeable people of HN. Is Moore&#x27;s Law actually dead? Are these EUV lithography machines really such an innovation that they have extended Moore&#x27;s law? If not, then how DOES computing hardware get faster from here, and what does the answer mean for programmers?",
