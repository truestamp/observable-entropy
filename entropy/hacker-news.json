      "text": "I have a limited understanding of AI so the question I&#x27;m about to ask may be entirely nonsensical.<p>My layman&#x27;s understanding of GAN machine learning is that you have two networks working against each other. For example, one producing images of peoples faces and the other trying to determine if a given image is of a persons face or not. When both networks are pitted against each other then you can eventually generate believable images of faces.<p>Modern software synthesisers have near unlimited complexity in producing sounds. For example, after a quick Google, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.automatonism.com&#x2F;the-software shows a modular synthesiser that can be composed together in near unlimited ways. It also comes with an interface for programming it that would suit plugging it into a system driving it programmatically.<p>Is it possible to combine both a GAN and a modular synthesiser together? In particular, I&#x27;d like to start with a wav file of a sound and have the synthesiser come up with a patch which mimics the provided sound.<p>I&#x27;m no stranger to programming patches and can achieve something similar to this manually. Likewise I&#x27;m sure that the GAN produced patch would&#x2F;could be lacking in articulation and modulation of the sound. However, I think it could lead to some interesting &quot;starting places&quot; for sounds which could be further tweaked.<p>I&#x27;d also be interested in how something like this would perform with synthesisers that were less complicated (i.e. be easier to manually tweak once the patch had been produced)",
