      "text": "I am a former FANG software engineer who left his job a few months ago to take a sabbatical.<p>I have always wanted to do a startup but recently I am opening up to the idea of joining a startup. Primarily because :-<p>1. Through working for a few years I now know some promising early startups run by people I like &amp; respect<p>2. I would learn from them and would get to build a lot<p>3. Have some structure in life, the problem statement would be decided and early on I can be pure execution as I increase ownership<p>4. They&#x27;re in a space that I am interested in but don&#x27;t understand, so would learn about the domain name.<p>At the same side on the startup side<p>1. I don&#x27;t have a co-founder<p>2. I have ideas that I am interested in but I don&#x27;t have something that I want to commit 10 years to. I have some ideas in which I see quick revenue but don&#x27;t see them IPO&#x27;ing while others are bigger longer term but seem like a struggle to start.<p>Overall, when I had joining big tech (or a hedge-fund), startup or starting one as options the first option &quot;big tech&quot; seemed like the easiest thing to do. Now joining one seems like the easiest thing to do.",
