      "text": "Hey HN! I&#x27;m Richie from Fella (www.joinfella.com), a telehealth clinic for men with obesity. We match fellas with a board-certified obesity doctor to prescribe an FDA-approved medication, and also match them with a psychological coach to tackle emotion-driven overeating.<p>I personally struggled in private with stress eating for 6 years [1]. During that time, I was at Cambridge University then built and sold my first company working with the UK government. It was stressful, and poor eating habits as a teenager became a coping mechanism as an adult.<p>Fella first started as a CBT+community product to help men struggling with stress eating. It resonated due to the stigma around men&#x27;s eating struggles. But we realized we were only half-serving most of our customers: even when no longer stress eating, most guys weren&#x27;t getting to a healthier weight.<p>So we started researching about effective, evidence-backed treatments for obesity.<p>When I say &quot;we&quot;, I really mean my co-founder Luke. He studied medicine at Cambridge University before transitioning into digital health, developing a patented AI approach to detecting cancer at a YC bio company, before moving to Microsoft Research. He parses bio papers better than me...<p>We learned that obesity treatment is about to radically change due to a breakthrough medication — NY Times called it a &quot;game changer&quot; in Feb 2021 [2]. The medication was FDA approved in June 2021 [3]. Main paper [4] and summary of phase 3 trials [5] are at the bottom of this post. But we also learned a medication-based approach is still stigmatized and hard to access.<p>So we pivoted to the Fella you see today: a telehealth experience with a board-certified obesity doctor for FDA-approved medication, and 1-on-1 psychological coaching to address emotion-driven overeating. We went live in Texas in July and are soon to be live in California &amp; New York. Fella costs $149&#x2F;month, paid quarterly.<p>We all know why obesity is a difficult problem to solve: for the vast majority of people willpower is not enough in today&#x27;s world. The deeper causes of obesity (metabolic issues &amp; emotion-driven eating) are mostly overlooked by the weight loss industry and family doctors, who focus too much on &quot;eat less, move more&quot;.<p>Why our solution is needed:\n1. Medication-assisted treatment for obesity is still stigmatized and hard to access.\n2. Stress eating is wildly prevalent among bigger guys, but it&#x27;s rarely recognized as a problem and there is a perception that eating struggles are a &quot;woman thing&quot; — so men often don&#x27;t seek help.\n3. Men represent only 10% of those using weight management services despite men representing 50% of those with obesity. Almost all programs market to women, often placing too much emphasis on looks and not enough on health for a male audience.<p>We still have lots of difficulties ahead. The main one could be insurance reimbursement: the latest wave of medications are expensive and insurers don&#x27;t like to cover them [6].<p>We’re excited to hear your ideas, questions, concerns, feedback — and maybe any personal stories. I’ll be responding to comments all day, or please feel free to shoot me an email at richie@joinfella.com.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.itv.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;anglia&#x2F;2020-11-09&#x2F;cambridge-graduate-who-ate-10k-calories-in-1-day-starts-online-eating-disorders-support-network<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;10&#x2F;health&#x2F;obesity-weight-loss-drug-semaglutide.html<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2032183<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;landia&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2213-8587(21)00081-4&#x2F;fulltext<p>[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2021-07-19&#x2F;weight-loss-drug-wegovy-could-help-millions-will-insurers-buy-in",
