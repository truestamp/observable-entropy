      "text": "My co-founder and I used to be in the fintech space. We used Zendesk to answer customer support tickets. We found a few big shortcomings with Zendesk as we used it: (1) no good secured messaging&#x2F;PII masker to securely send KYC docs and ensure the info wasn&#x27;t seen by those that shouldn&#x27;t; (2) we hated tickets -- they felt transactional and we were running a company that was intended to have super long lifetime value, so a continuous feed would be preferable, and (3) it lacked an effective real-time collaboration interface a la Slack meaning we&#x27;d be talking tickets on Slack. We&#x27;re thinking more deeply now about what would make killer support software, especially for early-stage companies where moving and learning fast are necessary.<p>What say ye all!?",
