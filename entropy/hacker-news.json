      "text": "We are building a SaaS tool to improve engineering teams&#x27; productivity by providing autonomy with real-time notifications.We have made more than 50 interviews with engineering managers from different organization cultures.<p>Interviews revealed common patterns,<p>- performance&#x2F;productivity mostly relies on intrinsic evaluation.<p>- managers mostly focused on sprint success where developers focused on building flawless products.<p>There are more patterns we identified but not related to this question(I can share them if you want).<p>&quot;intrinsic evaluation&quot; and &quot;building flawless products&quot; are my key terms so,<p>Developers wants to build flawless products.<p>Managers need to reach sprint success.<p>Two different perspectives.<p>To align those, most developers put in extra efforts (long working hours, no weekends, etc.), which leads to burnout.Not every manager has the same experience managing teams, so extra efforts either seem natural to them or aren&#x27;t seen.<p>So my question is,<p>how might we address those unseen efforts while productivity&#x2F;performance is evaluated on intrinsic feelings?",
