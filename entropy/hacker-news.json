      "text": "This may seem like a strange request, but I really enjoy HN because I don&#x27;t see a downvote icon attached to comments. I only think to interact with a comment if I want to upvote them and show support or leave a friendly comment. It&#x27;s a very positive flow.<p>As of now, when I see a comment I don&#x27;t agree with, I just scroll past. Once I hit a certain point threshold and acquire the downvote ability (I&#x27;m not too far off), I fear I may start paying more attention to the lower quality comments because I&#x27;ll feel like I need to help out HN by downvoting them.<p>I guess I associate downvoting someone&#x27;s post with some sort of &#x27;negative&#x27; mental response. The &#x27;no downvote&#x27; zone is great and I would like to remain here. If removing the downvote feature isn&#x27;t possible, could a mod reset my point score to zero?<p>Thanks!",
