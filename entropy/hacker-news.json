      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I wonder why there is so much different text editor&#x2F;IDE on the market.<p>In my daily job, I only use Emacs to develop in Fortran, write small script in python&#x2F;bash and write documents&#x2F;presentations in LaTex. I don&#x27;t see the point to switching to different editors&#x2F;IDE for each use case.<p>IMHO, it is has much more value to always keep the same shortcuts and macros than switching to a specialized IDE for each language, and loosing this consistency just to have one or two special features.<p>Does anyone here use multiple specialized IDE&#x2F;editors ? If so why did you make that choice ?",
