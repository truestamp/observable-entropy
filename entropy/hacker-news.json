      "text": "I’ve recently resolved (happy 2022, all) to be marginally more intentional about my choice of media consumption. In particular, using an RSS reader to collect articles from individual blogs. I enjoy infrequently updated personal blogs&#x2F;sites, with high quality articles from individual writers who are “experts” in their respective fields, rather than e.g. “daily news”&#x2F;lists of pointers&#x2F;references. As far as subject matter&#x2F;field goes, I’m open to anything. I find that the average value I get out of well-reasoned articles in fields other than my own (read: computers) is much higher than those in my own field of work. To that end, I’d love to hear of any high signal&#x2F;noise personal sites you enjoy reading that are syndicated via RSS, to help bootstrap this process.",
