      "text": "As a freelancer in a creative field, I&#x27;d love to be able to schedule my work in day or half day blocks across different projects and to have flexible views of my schedule. It seems the trends in new calendar&#x2F;scheduling apps are either team stuff, automating stuff, etc. So I recognise there probably isn&#x27;t huge demand for what I&#x27;m after, but the possibility of seeing my iCloud calendar and my work projects scheduled all in one view with clarity and flexibility would be amazing.<p>Does anyone know of anything like this? I&#x27;ve learned I&#x27;m not a good candidate for task &#x2F; project management apps, and I need the flexibility just to have high level &#x27;blocks&#x27; of time for projects, and that I need to have the ability to ensure I&#x27;ve blocked off enough time for each different client &#x2F; project to ensure nothing is forgotten.<p>I use Xero and Harvest, and have discovered that Harvest&#x27;s &#x27;Forecast&#x27; is an OK candidate, but it&#x27;s heavily geared toward teams in its functionality, and it&#x27;s also not as integrated into Harvest as one would assume it would be, so I&#x27;m not totally sold on it.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear about anything that&#x27;s out there that my intensive (obsessive) searches might have missed!",
