      "text": "WTF Instagram!<p>Earlier this week something unusual greeted me. I got logged out of my Instagram account. It appeared strange so I attempted to log back in and it displayed user not found. I was confused, was it a hack, was my account compromised. nothing appeared to work.<p>I quickly hopped on google and after a number of searches got a link to send a message to Instagram or meta support inquiring WTF is happening. After a day or so I got a response my account was disabled, and a link to their terms of use.<p>Now the account in question is my personal account. it is private I only share or post personal stuff with close family and friends why will I be in violation?<p>When I attempted to reset my account I noticed it directed me to a page but the email and phone number were not mine.<p>And this just got me thinking Instagram needs users, and users should also have rights. A vague email with terms and service violations is shameful. If I violated your terms let me know the terms I violated. If my account was compromised and you are punishing me I don&#x27;t think that is right.<p>I will love to get input from others who have experienced similar experiences with Instagram.<p>One love.",
