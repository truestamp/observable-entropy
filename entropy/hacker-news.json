      "text": "Hi there, cofounder of Rosita here. We were on TC yesterday https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;spains-rosita-longevity-an-app-that-helps-seniors-be-more-active-is-headed-to-florida&#x2F;<p>You probably know that Life expectancy is western countries is round 85. What you might not know is that Healthy Life Expectancy is only 65. Seniors live with a pain or a disease that could often be prevented.<p>Amongst muskuloskeltal diseases, frailty is a silent epidemic that affects 49% of the senior population and is the leading indicator or dependency. Not only that but 70% of seniors suffer osteoarthritis which leads to sedentarism and eventual frailty.<p>Startups always look for &quot;pains&quot; to solve. Well this is a literal pain that probably many of your parents suffer 365 days a year.<p>We come from a background of leading the largest longevity resort in Europe (balneario.com) where we educate 15,000 seniors per year in an immersive 10 day course on how to age better without disease. We have taken that methodology online.<p>Most seniors want to live to 100, but only if you promise them that they will not be in bed the last 10 years. While we wait for calico and losaltos to create extraterrestial technology, there is a lot your parents and grandparents can do to be in the best possible condition to live live the way they wanted.<p>If your parents or grandparents suffer some of this problems let me know. In fact, they should not wait until having problems. Just like in your 30s you start to plan your pension strategy, in your 60s you should plan your longevity strategy. All of us should have a longevity plan as early as possible.<p>ThatÂ´s us, thanks for reading :)<p>(We are on ProductHunt today if you want to support too)",
