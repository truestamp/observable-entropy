      "text": "I&#x27;ve been at a FANG company for about 6 years and I&#x27;m considering leaving the standard 9-5 to do private consulting. Before FANG I was part of two successful startups.<p>My motivations for consulting is more flexibility in my schedule and get the chance to build more projects from the ground up.<p>I have a fairly broad and deep set of skills. My principle background is infrastructure and distributed systems. Some of those systems are very large. I&#x27;m comfortable with Java, Go, Python and infrastructure tooling (docker, kubernetes, CI&#x2F;CD, etc). I have a deep understanding of security models (network, application, AWS IAM, etc).<p>I love nothing more than bootstrapping complicated infrastructure. I have a start-to-finish, project-based mindset. I&#x27;ve always worked well independently or with a team. I THINK I&#x27;d enjoy consulting, but am I just fooling myself?<p>What&#x27;s it like out there for people like me? What does it realistically take to get a stable income stream? How do I get started?",
