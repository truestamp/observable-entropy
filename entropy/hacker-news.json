      "text": "So Microsoft bought Minecraft, a game written in Java, their direct competitors language (Oracle). I&#x27;ve seen many things that claim that the biggest reason people are learning Java and interested in Java is because of Minecraft. People are developing mods, servers (plugins) and so much more (With Java), and Microsoft has had absolutely no direct involvement in any of this. So why would Microsoft rewrite a Java game in C++ when they literally made C#? C# is cross platform too, and if there weren&#x27;t game libraries already created, they could create them. Microsoft made a key&#x2F;value database in C# that could do like 250 million requests per second. (Proof of concept, but still). This was Microsoft biggest opportunity to promote their own programming language.<p>Microsoft is in big trouble though because Hypixel Minecraft server made something called Hypixel Studios and started the development of a new game called Hytale. And guess what? It&#x27;s written in C#, but the servers are going to be written in Java for some reason. The game is gonna be a Minecraft clone with likely better performance and it will also support scripting, modding etc. out of the box.<p>Long story short, Hytale is aiming to be everything Minecraft is not, and more. They&#x27;re actually going to build a community. I&#x27;m not complaining about Microsoft staying our of the community. Because they did, that&#x27;s probably why we have SpigotMC, Bukkit, Curse, Twitch, Minecraft Forums, Planet Minecraft and so much more, but I still see one of the biggest failed opportunities of all time.<p>Anyways, either Microsoft missed an opportunity or it&#x27;s just the fact that they&#x27;re big tech-- Microsoft bought Minecraft to expand profits, not make it better for players.  Any thoughts? Agree&#x2F;Disagree?<p>(I wrote most of this at at like 3:00AM a day or two ago, so I&#x27;m sure what I wrote seems a little weird... but just go with it lmao-- I&#x27;m too lazy to rewrite it)",
