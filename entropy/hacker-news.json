      "text": "I’ve been noticing that every few weeks (maybe days even) there’s a discussion on why Company should and shouldn’t be doing, what’s typical of them to do since the control a market or a section of it, and possibly their hold&#x2F;sway on the regulation of the market. There are the recent and obvious examples like Apple’s case with their App Store, and there are the somewhat less obvious ones like Amazon, Microsoft, etc…<p>So what do you think is the main issue here? And what’s the most likely solution(s) to work? Is it a matter of regulation or consumer awareness? Do we need more laissez faire in our capitalism?<p>Curious to see what people think, and why.",
