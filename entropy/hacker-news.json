      "text": "Periodically I search for my name on the internet. I can&#x27;t clearly remember, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I took the appropriate measures to prevent my private information from being sold years ago. So I was surprised and angered when I found it all openly listed for free.<p>A few days ago I googled (yes, google.com. DDG didn&#x27;t return the website for me) my name and the 3rd-4th result was fastpeoplesearch.com with ALL of my previous addresses, past phone numbers, past roommates, an old email address, and all of my immediate family members. I don&#x27;t own property, so only a handful of companies I interact with could be selling all this info.<p>I changed phone numbers 5 years ago and my current number isn&#x27;t listed, but my current address is (over a year here). No utilities are in my name. This is so frustrating.<p>How can I put an end to this permanently?<p>Anyways, if you have ever ordered one of your free credit reports, some of the security questions are your past addresses. I think other soft ID verifications use this info to IIRC, but its been awhile.<p>If you find your name on fastpeoplesearch.com, scroll down to the bottom and click &quot;Do not sell my personal information&quot; and follow the instructions.",
