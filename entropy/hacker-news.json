It still comes out on top for e.g. querying for technical information but for other things (image search) I don&#x27;t even bother with it anymore. It also feels like certain kinds of queries are subject to malicious SEO practices where it becomes impossible to find results that aren&#x27;t from the same group of tabloids&#x2F;media outlets.<p>What happened? Did they let their golden goose starve to death? Or is this all in my head and Google is actually fine for everyone else?",
