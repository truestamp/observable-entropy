      "text": "For context, I am a manager at a medium sized enterprise software company, I worked as an engineer for 10+ years and took over managing the team. We have 80+ engineers in the entire org. broken down into smaller teams of 5-10. My team specifically has about 15 engineers broken down into teams of 3-5. \nWe have a very challenging roadmap and often we end up delivering 20-30% of what&#x27;s planned for the year. One thing that&#x27;s often asked is how do we estimate, how do we predict when some feature will be done.\nWe are close to 20+ years into the usage of Agile methods, there is the school of though who prefer to use time based estimates, some try story points and then there is the No Estimates movement.\nI am trying to see what&#x27;s considered as a best practice to start something for the team in 2021.",
