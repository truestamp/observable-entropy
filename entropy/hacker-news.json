I&#x27;m looking to develop for the local market, but I want to try ideas that have already been tested in other countries (especially southeast Asia market) and adapt from there. Any example that would be considered essential nowadays? I&#x27;ve seen people write scripts to automate jobs and stuff but I lack domain knowledge to really know where to focus. Thats why I ask your collective experience. Thanks",

If this isn&#x27;t adjusted I have effectively taken a pay cut of 5%.<p>Independent of raises based on things like role changes or good performance how can I stress that I really dislike the idea of not having my salary keep up with inflation, and then how can I best go about ensuring that my employer keeps the salary up to date with inflation?",
