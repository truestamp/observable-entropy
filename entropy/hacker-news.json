      "text": "I&#x27;m a PM for a technical product. Our customers are developers. At work, I have a peer that I&#x27;ll call Sam (we share the same manager). Sam is great as a person, but at work, I have the impression from the kinds of questions he asks that he doesn&#x27;t really have the technical background to understand their product.<p>For example, I watched him a few times trying to sell his product to a customer based on the high level buzzwords, but when the conversation starts getting technical because the customer is trying to understand how their product might help solve a particular problem, he&#x27;ll say things like &quot;let&#x27;s take a step back from the solutions and let me understand the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve&quot;, even if the customer at that point really does want to talk about the detail.<p>Or, after I explain a particular customer&#x27;s situation, he&#x27;ll ask me &quot;why don&#x27;t they use [product X]&quot; which is an irrelevant fit for the problem. I&#x27;ve had more productive conversations talking directly with Sam&#x27;s engineers, and I&#x27;ve heard from some of them that they feel he&#x27;s adding negative value due to his lack of technical depth.<p>Now my manager is asking me to work closer with Sam on a project, and I find it difficult because I feel like he&#x27;s dragging conversations backwards or derailing them due to lack of technical understanding. Moreover, Sam projects very high confidence, and doesn&#x27;t look aware of his deficiencies.<p>How would you deal with this? I&#x27;m thinking of telling my boss what I think about Sam and ask to be left alone, but part of me feels shitty about badmouthing Sam.<p>The extra challenge is, I sort of lied: Sam is actually a woman, in an extremely male team (~80%, and both I and my manager are men). I just didn&#x27;t want my post to sound like a misogynistic rant... It causes me extra concern because I want to help her succeed as much as possible, and in my past experience when I&#x27;ve provided constructive feedback to women, on a couple occasions they told me they found it sexist.",
