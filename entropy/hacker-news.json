      "text": "Hi, are you a US entrepreneur (or team) without a project currently? You don&#x27;t have to be technical, the following is for everyone.<p>After attending startup school W2020 we launched a service which has gone live in the UK (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hug.agency).<p>We are launching recruitment agencies globally which gift 100% net agency fee back to the worker and society. No traditional agency can compete with us, their shareholders won&#x27;t let them give away their profits. We also give better benefits for businesses (than traditional agencies) such as support for their ESG commitment (very important for institutional investment) and great brand kudos as they are credited with injecting (on average) $4000 wealth per job back into their local communities.<p>However, we are not really recruiters, we are a fintech. We are capturing their $400B annual global market using &quot;not-for-profit&quot; agencies, but which generate significant profits using a &quot;for-profit&quot; fintech (by managing the asset portfolios the new hires create with their gift). Therefore, we do huge societal good, but also generate great investor returns (i.e. we are a social impact, so you will be helping families get more wealth in their pockets).<p>We would now like to launch in the USA and are inviting a number of US co-founder&#x2F;investors to join us and be part of the founding team. You will be joining our first round, at no financial or operating disadvantage to the original team who created the service.<p>We are introducing new digital economy technology (digital wallets, verifiable credentials, tokenomics and later A.I) into the recruitment process. Our founders will receive a percentage of free tokens (regulated securities, designed to appreciate in price), which they can sell on a public exchange later. Future agencies will be run by employed staff (not founders) and so you will share the fintech profits from all of the agencies as we expand globally.<p>We&#x27;re looking for US co-founders with the energy, skills (maybe with a good business network) to launch our recruitment agencies in the US (with sales benefits no traditional agency can compete with). In return you will co-own the offshore parent business (in a tax efficient and crypto friendly jurisdiction governed by English law), plus franchises, plus security tokens.<p>So, if you are an entrepreneur&#x2F;investor seeking to co-found a project which could kickstart your future ones, I&#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>ps - non-US entrepreneurs please DM too. We can prioritise i18n application support for your country or find a temporary workaround.",
