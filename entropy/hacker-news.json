      "text": "Currently work at a big FAANG and am kinda bored, but making good&#x2F;great money.<p>Recently got hit up with a request for some founders who just quit their jobs for their new venture.<p>They&#x27;re in the process of raising a seed within the next couple of weeks. I think the project is pretty viable and will almost certainly be funded. (it&#x27;s SAAS and Web3&#x2F;Crypto, and the founders worked for VCs prev as well as&#x2F;top tech companies ;)).<p>Generally speaking prev advice with seed startups is you can expect to live off ramen but has that changed in the current environment where everyone is flush with cash?<p>Would you leave if the product was both technically interesting and viable? I&#x27;m relatively early in my career, college grad during the beginning of the pandemic, and don&#x27;t want to get totally screwed if this doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>Anyone have experience, esp recent experience, with working for these super early stage startups? E.g. the founders just quit their jobs a matter of weeks ago.",
