Luckily the internet has plenty of opportunities!<p>However, by now there are so many I am looking for <i>your</i> favorites, most recommended ones, most worthwhile.\nAnything that you feel has given you additional core competencies, skills, general knowledge, deepened your understanding, satisfied your curiousities.\nIt can be about IT skills (programming courses, Docker, Kubernetes), general knowledge fields (culture, philosopy), specific knowledge fields (economics, finances, psychology), skill building (learning to learn, public speaking, social skills), interesting topics (quantum physics, wine, ...).<p>Basically anything goes, as long as you learned something and you found it useful, interesting or personal development building. \nAlso, preferably, free courses, trajectories or curriculums, anything that is online and easily accessible.<p>I will give some examples of the above, I liked myself:<p>* The Science of Well-Being by Yale &amp; Laurie Santos (available on Coursera)<p>* Justice at Harvard College (available on EdX)<p>* The Odin Project (available through Google, about web development)<p>*  Financial Markets by Yale University (on Coursera)<p>Looking forward to your suggestions!",
