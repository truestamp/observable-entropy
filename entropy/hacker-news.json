      "text": "This is for a tech company that has a CEO and a CPO without a prototype, customers or any other full-time hires. They are about to close on their seed funding though and I&#x27;ll be joining after right after that. The equity will be from the founders pool and the salary is somewhat negotiable between 100k-200k per year before taxes. In terms of the other founders, one of them has a gotten their startup acquired before for 10s of millions (I think - undisclosed figure but I put that number together from the parent company&#x27;s total funding) and the other founder has no prior startup experience. One of them has some limited tech experience.<p>What would you accept in this case as the CTO?",
