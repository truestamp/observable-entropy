      "text": "Hi all, compliments of the season :-)<p>In my home office, I&#x27;d like to install a custom audio panel, next to the room&#x27;s light switch, by the door as you walk in.<p>I envision the panel having  a large (preferably metallic) black volume knob, with adjacent buttons for &quot;previous track&quot; and &quot;next track&quot;.<p>If possible, pressing the volume knob pauses &#x2F; plays the currently queued track. Otherwise I can just add a third button to do this.<p>Then above the volume knob and buttons, I&#x27;d like to fit a small OLED display, showing the track name and cover art.<p>In terms of the hardware &#x2F; software interface, my goal is to wirelessly send events from this panel to my home PC (which is operating Linux, and which runs 24&#x2F;7).<p>On this PC I use cmus, and have a fixed playlist of about 5 extended tracks that I listen to during deep work sessions.<p>So given the minimal and looping nature of my listening requirements, the basic panel interface I described above is fit for my purposes, and I&#x27;d prefer it to not have any other buttons or features.<p>That being said, I know very little about how to acquire or build said hardware. I also don&#x27;t know much about interfacing with this sort of hardware, so I would appreciate any advice.<p>If it helps, I know a little C, and reckon I could figure out how to use a decoder from github if that&#x27;s the best way to go (but maybe I can just pipe events to cmus?). I also once studied an Arduino manual, and it made good sense, so my plan is to pursue this next as far as hardware goes.<p>Thanks! ^_^",
