      "text": "My company is rolling out M365 and is going to sunset Confluence.<p>My team has made confluence an integral part of our daily work. We use it for two purposes:<p>1) knowledge repository. all major process instructions, tools, on-boarding information, workflow diagrams, etc. get written documentation in confluence.<p>2) meeting notes &amp; follow ups. before each meeting the host creates an agenda template in confluence, all attendees edit concurrently with their updates &#x2F; topics in written form. we read ahead of time and minimize meeting time by discussing the written updates only. follow ups from the meeting are tracked using checkboxes and @ mentions in confluence that get aggregated up to the space level.<p>Most of us watch the entire space so get email  updates of new content &#x2F; edits, etc.  People feel comfortable skipping meetings when they have nothing to add because they know that there will be thorough notes of the topics and they won&#x27;t miss out on information.<p>This is all going away and I need to figure out the best way to replicate it in the microsoft stack. It seems like there are a myriad of ways to accomplish any particular task in teams&#x2F;sharepoint.<p>Does HN have any suggestions for how to best do what I described above?<p>Also, some general observations about sharepoint I&#x27;m wondering if anyone could tell me if they&#x27;re true:<p>Search seems woefully inadequate, and there seems to be a lack of transparency in that users don&#x27;t see anything unless they&#x27;ve been explicitly granted access, and even then the top level sharepoint has no functionality to browse sites you have access to, you have to know about it, or access it through teams. Contrast with confluence there&#x27;s a news feed and most spaces across our company are public so if you like you can see activity other teams are up to there or find things in other team spaces that might be relevant to your group via search.",
