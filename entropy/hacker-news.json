      "text": "I don&#x27;t understand this industry. There are very few junior developer jobs and even they ask for 2 years of experience. How is one supposed to enter the higher paying market?<p>I work as a Node&#x2F;Angular developer in a South Asian country and over the past 8 months have gained domain specific skills comparable to my own team lead who came from a different background. I write tests, APIs, UI features, deploy to QA, fix issues in QA, fix the build pipeline, architectured microservices and micro-frontend pattern,  etc. I am not bragging, every of my team member does this and they should be paid more too. I am sure there are developers more competent than me but I really think I should be paid a lot more than $500&#x2F;mo especially reading developers salary in American and European countries.<p>How do I as a South Asian junior developer land a better paying job? Remote is almost impossible considering they don&#x27;t let Junior developers work remote and looks like only option is to move abroad but hardly anyone sponsors VISA especially for a South Asian junior developer.<p>Am I stuck here forever?",
