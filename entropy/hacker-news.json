      "text": "Hi everyone, I want to tell you about a new concept, a new word, a new idea.<p>I have been talking for years about a new social construct, a new structure of conduct. Things like Facebook, the Internet, and Bitcoin are the those that make it possible.<p>For several years I have been trying to tell people about this new construct that I envision - and each time using all sorts of terms that I find appropriate at that moment, depending on the listener, or depending on our geopolitical and socioeconomic situation at the time.<p>And I have realized in recent months that one of my mistakes is that I am trying to explain something new with old terms. Then the listener hears a term he already knows, and gets a sense of what it is and what it is not, even before I have time to say one word about my new idea!<p>So today you are exposed to a new word in Hebrew and English, this word is: &quot;שבד&quot; (Sheved) in Hebrew and &quot;Tride&quot; in English.<p>What is a Tride? Hopefully this already lights up some associations - by and large this is a Digital Tribe - as well as in Hebrew: שבט דיגטלי.<p>What does it mean? This means, as mentioned, a new social structure. I feed this structure between our private homes, and up to a city and maybe even a country further down the road - that is, on the order of people involved. The tride is designed to provide a cultural response to a number of unmet needs in our current society, including:<p>Community - people want to belong, but with our constant movement in space, moving from apartment to apartment, from city to city, from country to country we have a hard time finding the relevant community - community is in my opinion a very important element in our daily lives that we all miss, and there are cultures - like the religious and the ultra-orthodox, for who it is easier first of all under the auspices of the community, thanks to the fact that they have a rabbi who knows how to take responsibility and tell everyone in the community what he thinks, and help the community develop and grow.<p>==== CONTINUING IN COMMENTS ===",
