We posted the first time here more than a year ago when it was young. Now we&#x27;re at version 1.1.5. Our founder, a young Ukrainian woman, was severely wounded in the war and unfortunately passed away. We would like to state that our project is still alive. Still maintained. Still updated. Just changed URL from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anonymousplanet.org to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anonymousplanet-ng.org.<p>Any opinion or criticism would be welcome. It&#x27;s free, open-source, no ads, no affiliates, no sponsors. Any help would be welcome. Even if it&#x27;s just a follow on our twitter. We need collaborators, proofreaders, and people decent with Ruby...<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Anon-Planet&#x2F;thgtoa | Contact us on Matrix: @memorysafetybelike:envs.net | Or on Twitter: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AnonyPla",

      "text": "I know the best mitigation for ransomware is to maintain off-site backups.  I cannot do this.  It is a design requirement not to have offline storage.<p>What are some ways you have prepared for ransomware?<p>I&#x27;ve thought about:<p>1) udev rules that blacklist drives until the infrequent moments I do full backups<p>2) a &quot;USB condom&quot; of sorts that I can remotely disconnect (sever the 5V line), to make a USB spinning HD available as needed with an authentication scheme<p>3) running a program that tries to detect ransomware execution (antivirus or excessive cpu usage&#x2F;encryption&#x2F;etc)<p>4) mirror it to the cloud (unworkable, considering it&#x27;s 16TB)<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a solution as good as offsite backups.  Most of these are ideas that add indirection or complexity that common ransomware wouldn&#x27;t be coded for.<p>How do you disconnect a drive without disconnecting it?  Especially nvme rather than a USB enclosure?<p>What is your creative solution?",
