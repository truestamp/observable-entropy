      "text": "I read https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31341083 recently and feel quite frustrated because now everyone is rendering html using javascript. I&#x27;m on twitter reading web stuff, when they talk about &quot;SSR&quot; (server-sided rendering), 99% of the time it means javascript based server. Why these trying-to-be-innovation lately aren&#x27;t not working with backend languages like python, ruby, elixir, go, rust etc?<p>I have an SPA app that is quite sophisticated whose WHOLE app size is ~110kB minified, and when I look at react-dom on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bundlephobia.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;react-dom@18.1.0 it&#x27;s 130kB minified which sounds CREAZY to me compared to my whole app (no, it&#x27;s not a todo app, it&#x27;s an editor app)<p>Is it just me that interpret this situation as &quot;suck&quot;, or this is the future?",
