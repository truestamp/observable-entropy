      "text": "Dear fellow Mac users,<p>What’s your favourite hypervisor for a macOS host?<p>I’m currently pondering what hypervisor to use and would appreciate some input from other Mac users. What has worked well for you folks, what hasn’t worked well?<p>See below for some options that I have found.<p>Would love to hear from you regarding this matter.<p>¤ <i>PARALLELS</i> ¤<p>Good performance. Support is included in the subscription. Works with M1 CPUs. A Vagrant provider is available. Proprietary software.<p>Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parallels.com&#x2F;eu&#x2F;products&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;<p>¤ <i>VMWARE FUSION</i> ¤<p>Supposedly stable. A Vagrant provider is available. M1 CPUs still in beta. No support included(?). Proprietary software.<p>Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vmware.com&#x2F;se&#x2F;products&#x2F;fusion.html<p>¤ <i>UTM</i> ¤<p>Open source. Nice clean GUI. Works with M1 CPUs. Community support available. No Vagrant provider available. Not so mature, still quite buggy.<p>Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mac.getutm.app&#x2F;<p>¤ <i>QEMU (with our without libvirt)</i> ¤<p>Open source. Works with M1 CPUs. Community support available. No mature Vagrant provider available.<p>Configuration is not straight-forward. Guides and documentation are mostly related to Linux hosts, much of that information is not relevant for a macOS host. HVF support is probably not mature yet.<p>Unclear how to configure networking[0].<p>Website: See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.qemu.org&#x2F;Features&#x2F;HVF, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.qemu.org&#x2F; and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;libvirt.org&#x2F;<p>¤ <i>VIRTUALBOX</i> ¤<p>Open source. A Vagrant provider is available. Community support available. No M1 support.<p>I’ve found the GUI to be buggy on recent versions of macOS. And I’m not fond of using products that are owned and developed by Oracle.<p>Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virtualbox.org&#x2F;<p>[0] See e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listman.redhat.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;libvirt-users&#x2F;2022-March&#x2F;013501.html",
