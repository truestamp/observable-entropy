      "text": "I&#x27;ve seen some interests in (simulation) video games here on HN so I thought I&#x27;d share a short version of our story.<p>More than 6 years ago, me and my friend from university were playing around with an idea of making a game we always wanted to play. We worked on it on weekends but the progress was quite slow, especially due to so many dead ends and wasted effort.<p>Eventually however, we solidified our direction and decided to take the risk to resign from our well paid SWE jobs and work on it full time. It took more than a year but yesterday we have finally released it on Steam: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1594320&#x2F;Captain_of_Industry&#x2F;<p>I am still not sure if this was a good decision financially, but unlike in a corporate environment, I am so much happier working on a product that I can put my love into and see people enjoy it, see my direct impact, and be able to make big decisions (although this also adds a lot of stress).<p>I also quite enjoy the added SWE challenges. I had to write so many complex algorithms (path-finding, logistics, serialization, ...) and optimize things down to bits (shaders, compression of in-memory data, ...) that were rarely required by my corp job.<p>Anyhow, this is getting a little long, feel free to ask any questions, I will do my best to answer them.",

      "text": "Is one of the protocols better than the other one?<p>My opinion in advance:\nI think Matrix is neither better than XMPP nor the other way around: The protocols are just different but can be combined with their advantages (let&#x27;s say X[M]PP) ;-)\nEvery matrix server has the ability to bridge to the international standard XMPP and there is the way XMPP to Matrix too. So it is up to the administrators&#x2F;decision makers to open this door to interoperability.
