      "text": "I have been thinking a lot about pro-active dependency management. I would like to have a tool or a way to gather latest release versions of various tools and then ideally get alerted if a new version gets released.<p>For example Gradle is at 7.3.1, if 7.3.2 becomes available I would like to know about it. Doing it for a single tool is simple, but having to track latest Git version, NPM, Gradle and all the other tools I work with doesn&#x27;t scale very well.<p>Is there an existing solution to this problem?",
