They release a new article every few hours in some cases, just to show up in Google&#x27;s &quot;News&quot; results.<p>I don&#x27;t believe a human is manually writing about a single stock for 10,000 articles, so in my view it&#x27;s highly likely that these are driven by some kind of article-writing software, GPT-3 could easily write these things from what I&#x27;ve seen.<p>Is it unethical of the website to do this? Should google demote these results? Or label it as &quot;Generated by AI&quot;?",
