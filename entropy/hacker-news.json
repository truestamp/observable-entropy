      "text": "I&#x27;m teaching a performance engineering class at UC Davis (EEC 289Q) that&#x27;s based on the amazing 6.172 performance engineering class from MIT. While many instructors have taught this class, Charles Leiserson has been the principal instructor for many years, and it&#x27;s been a pleasure working with him and his colleagues in bringing it to UC Davis.<p>Much of the class has been a little more abstract, high-level, academic and I&#x27;d like to give a lecture that has several interesting practical examples that underscore some of the ideas that were taught in class. I&#x27;ve gathered a number of links from Hacker News over the past few months that are possible examples of what I&#x27;d love to hear (see below). The hope is that you might be able to suggest material or links that are along the lines of an in-depth blog post, hopefully with some interesting quantitative results, that basically tells a story like &quot;I had this performance problem; it wasn&#x27;t obvious that the answer to the problem was X, but I did some digging and it turns out it was X and I addressed it by Y.&quot; Ideally, X would be related to a topic we discussed in the class, which included:<p>General C-level performance optimizations &#x2F; bit hacks &#x2F; LLVM IR &#x2F; compiler optimizations &#x2F; races and parallelism &#x2F; anything having to do with Cilk, which we studied in depth &#x2F; parallel algorithms &#x2F; storage allocation &#x2F; cache {efficient, oblivious} algorithms &#x2F; synchronization<p>Here&#x27;s some of the links I collected from Hacker News that I thought might be suitable for ~10-15 minutes each:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernoon.com&#x2F;timsort-the-fastest-sorting-algorithm-youve-never-heard-of-36b28417f399<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;apankrat&#x2F;notes&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;fast-case-conversion<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;madler&#x2F;crcany<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dlang.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;14&#x2F;lomutos-comeback&#x2F;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aqjune.github.io&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2021-10-4.the-select-story.html<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nee.lv&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;28&#x2F;How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;d be much obliged for any suggestions you might have!",
