      "text": "Mobile apps have to ask for most resources they use so that phones are somewhat secure and private and this model works for some definitions of &quot;work&quot;. At the same time, Firefox and Safari don&#x27;t implement various web api-s with the argument that they could be used for user fingerprinting despite the fact that some of them might be useful for many users. So, what stops them from implementing a permissions framework like the mobile apps? Something like that is already implemented for camera and microphone. What are the potential pitfalls for extending it to others? People are already familiar with the mobile apps permissions so it is not unreasonable to expect that they can recognize when a web app asks for too much access.<p>Of course, there will be the hostage strategy where some websites won&#x27;t provide access to their content unless they are given full access to your entire search history, online purchases, and genetic records, but the web is big enough to provide us with options.",
