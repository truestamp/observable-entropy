      "text": "Hey HN, I created Smort as I wanted to highlight an article and share it with a friend but couldn&#x27;t find an easy way of doing it.<p>Smort lets you easily edit, annotate and share an article. To read any article, just prepend smort.io&#x2F; before a URL in a browser. (I recently found out that even 12ft.io&#x2F; uses the same technique). Smort is free to use and shareable links are valid for 7 days from creation. Permanent links will be supported soon.<p>I&#x27;m primarily a backend&#x2F;ML engineer so had to learn all things frontend to build Smort. I started out developing in SvelteKit and loved it but later migrated to React &amp; Nextjs due to better third party library support. I have lots of ideas on how to take Smort forward and would love for you all to use it. Please join our Discord to share your curated articles and feedback!<p>This is a walkthrough article detailing everything Smort can do at the moment - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smort.io&#x2F;demo-walkthrough\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smort.io&#x2F;demo-walkthrough</a>.<p>Smort&#x27;s name was inspired by the memes [1]<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=smort+meme&amp;tbm=isch\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=smort+meme&amp;tbm=isch</a>",
