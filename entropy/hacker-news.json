      "text": "Hello. I am interviewing for a company and they&#x27;ve moved me to final stages. They asked me in the first interview how I like to be interviewed&#x2F;what interview tactics worked for me. I said to go over code in depth that the interviewee has worked on and is proud of. So this is how they are interviewing me for my final stage which is fantastic.<p>Thing is, 99% of the code I&#x27;m proud of and want to show off are my own projects which I&#x27;ve put a lot of time into, and are profitable SaaS apps. Not enough to negate a day job, but enough to afford life without one. I have a lot of free time and I found a company I&#x27;m very excited to join that is very in line with what I am doing.<p>I&#x27;m not against sending them code, and it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t trust them, I am just trying to find the best way to go about this without sending all the code to a fully working and profitable SaaS app.",
