I&#x27;ve talked to a few people who say the number is arbitrary and that you can increase the number of shares issued with a board resolution before a priced round; I&#x27;ve also read that it&#x27;s common to issue 10,000,000 shares initially (still before a priced round).<p>Are there any ramifications for not issuing enough shares and needing to add more, and, vice versa - issuing too many?<p>Thanks!",
