      "text": "I recently got Walmart plus subscription service. I made an order of ~$50 and no where during my checkout experience did I chose or manipulated the tip. Apparently I have to go back and change it later. It looked like I could change it to $0 that way if someone choose to. In my case, it was set to $7 by default.<p>This seems like a dark pattern to me. Has the tip economy gone digital? Are those drivers in similar position as some service workers where they can&#x27;t make their ends meet without those tips? Or maybe I am overthinking and this is a solution that does work.",
