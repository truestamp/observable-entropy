      "text": "Like many people in my field (DevOps &#x2F; SRE), I started my career working technical support. First it was low-level stuff for my university, but my first post-graduation job (CS degree) was doing Engineering Support at AWS. It was actually an extremely fun and rewarding job in most ways. Still, I got out of there as soon as I got a DevOps job offer somewhere. I think I just associated anything with &quot;support&quot; in the title as being a low-status and low-wage job. There&#x27;s sort of an idea that being skilled at something is somewhat at odds with working on a shift like that and picking up phone calls from strangers.<p>But these days, especially when I find myself immersed in on-call type work, I actually find myself kind of nostalgic for support. It was a pretty good fit for me, for a few different reasons I can get into if asked.<p>But the core of my question, is there anyone here who actually did try to build a career moving up ladder for technical&#x2F;engineering support? How is that working out? Do you ever think about switching into something else?",
