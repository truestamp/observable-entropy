      "text": "How can it be that technology today is so sophisticated but I still have to remember where I saved my stuff, in which folder I put my document or what I have in my bookmarks, at the moment where I need it? The way we store and manage documents literally has not changed since our days of physical paper, folders and cabinets. It’s just not intuitive – when I try to remember something, I also don’t look through my brain trying to figure out where I stored it in there. I try to remember what it was about, and use as much contextual information about it as I can remember, until I have enough puzzle pieces together; “right – where did I hear about it, who told me this, when did I come across it, what other information is it related to, what was it about?” \nSo I sat down with my talented developer friend and tried to reverse engineer the way human memory works, learning about neuroscience, speaking to knowledge management experts, going all in – and it led us to graph databases. In a graph database, items are connected to each other and carry meta descriptions, which essentially means information about the item – descriptors. And based on that, we built Reach, a completely novel way to store documents, websites, media, contacts, notes, absolutely anything. Now, finally, instead of having to remember a given folder path or certain keywords, there’s a multitude of angles from which I can get to the data I need, I can easily search for it by typing in anything I remember about it, or I can precisely navigate through my content if I’m not sure what exactly I’m searching for, I just need to know the general topic. It works like an interconnected library with copies of books in every place you could possibly need them – except they’re not copies but the same exact item appearing in all the relevant places, keeping it light. So whether you’re browsing or searching, you’re guaranteed to get to the data you need, no matter when you saved it or where you saved it. \nAnd doing it this way doesn’t only make the discovery of your content faster and more intuitive, also saving it is much quicker. You don’t need to choose or create folders and subfolders, you just throw it in there, select relationships and add any description that might be useful later on. With time, AI will automate this process. This way, we managed to build a Second Brain for all your digitally stored knowledge that works just the way you think. This also means that sharing an entire knowledge base becomes so much easier because you don’t need to tell anybody where you saved stuff, the easiest brain transplant ever. And we’re not stopping here. Next on our bucket list, we’re planning to go one step further and allow qualified users to publish their knowledge base – or ‘workspace’. This will make Reach a one-of-a-kind, curated search engine with content that’s hand-selected around a particular topic. Users who access a workspace will be able to suggest additions or modifications to the creator of the collection. This extends Reach to a powerful collaborative research and learning platform that enables anybody to develop expertise around certain subjects, with all the best selected resources in one place.<p>We just launched our Beta and we’re giving access to our first users.

      "text": "Hi HN Community,<p>Today&#x27;s beginner investors are stuck with zero-interest rate accounts and passive investing. That might work for some but if you are interested to explore more active investing opportunities, you will soon find yourself out-traded by funds and bots who control much of the market volume.<p>We are Gabriele, Zdenek and Oleg, founders of Coinrule https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinrule.com&#x2F;. We met back in 2017 when we were building our previous startups and met at Masschallenge, an accelerator program, in London. At that time all three of us were experimenting with cryptocurrencies investing and soon found that unless we used automation, we could not compete in a 24&#x2F;7 market. That&#x27;s when we started to think of a solution, now called Coinrule.<p>Coinrule helps beginner investor build automated rules for trading strategies, currently for cryptocurrencies but later also for other assets - it runs on top of cryptocurrency exchanges and uses an IFTTT-style interface. It&#x27;s like Zapier for investing.<p>The Cryptocurrency world came along with a lot of controversies, at the same time it gave many makers a possibility to start deconstructing finance. Also for us, cryptocurrencies are a good place to try and build a more equal way of managing your savings.<p>We are part of this market and believe in it. Our ultimate goal is to make trading more accessible and to expand Coinrule to equities, FX and later also to DeFi to give beginner investors the opportunity to manage their funds in a market full of speculators.<p>When we first started investing, we approached it from two beliefs: 1) you are unlikely to grow a portfolio without a small percentage of it allocated to more active investments and 2) tools in the market today are made by traders for advanced traders. Many of our users have learned, grown and improved as traders over the past year of using Coinrule and that&#x27;s what we think really matters.<p>Of course we understand that the HN community has a lot of cryptocurrency sceptics and we respect that. The cryptocurrency market is still full of scams and bad actors. Whether you like it or not though, it is now big enough that it is here to stay. Despite the bad reputation, there are also many genuine and hard working people trying to build technology that matters. We believe that it is worthwhile to try make cryptocurrencies an easier place to navigate for these &#x27;normal&#x27; people. If one of our users does not have the right mindset or could be vulnerable and should not be trading, we tell them that.<p>Coinrule today is registered with the UK&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority, has transacted over $500m and is run by an international and diverse team.<p>Building a product, as you all know, is hard so we&#x27;d appreciate comments and feedback. We&#x27;d love to hear anything that helps make Coinrule better, simpler and fairer. Please try us out at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinrule.com! Happy to answer any questions and hear your feedback in the comments!",
