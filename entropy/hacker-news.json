      "text": "Worms are URLs which are allowed to pop from any text software into any other process beyond the browser. It captures the screen and extracts worm links.<p>Method:<p>- Continually printscreen<p>- OCR from the capture<p>- Process wormholes<p>- Only allow specific worms&#x2F;URL types to run automatically (for security) - this is URL typing<p>Example: allow &quot;imgur&quot; worms to auto-display pictures hosted from imgur, as a display notification, or ideally (with a compatible browser&#x27;s plugin) insert into the page where the worm text is situated.<p>It would look like this: worm:&#x2F;&#x2F;image&#x2F;imgur&#x2F;arg1-arg2-...-argn<p>That can only extract image type, and only images from imgur sources. This is type-safe, and you&#x27;ll see the notification-image in whatever app you happened to display that text, even inside a 3D app or videogame. It is app-agnostic hypertext links.<p>How to make it happen right now for increased business productivity:<p>- use something like Capture2text to OCR printed-screen into copypaste (this is the hard part)<p>- extract worm links from the copypasted every X seconds using any programming language<p>- process those links one by one, example: display a picture on the bottom-right corner of the display, using the imgur worm link, without having to click it.<p>I understand there were security issues but as the years go by and security progresses, this could be useful.",
