I can easily spare a few bucks, but I generally don’t give them any money.<p>I was curious if others who work in places with lots of high paying jobs but lots of homeless as well, do or don’t and why or why not. My instinct is a more right leaning person would say “no don’t give them money they’ll spend it on drugs and alcohol” and a more left leaning person would say “give them a few bucks, it’s not their fault”, but wanted to here from others. I feel a little guilty just trying to ignore them as I drive past, but I’m also like should I?",
