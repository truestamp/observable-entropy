      "text": " Can we use this API safely in the long term is a difficult question to answer in the Digital world we live in. Most of the time, companies discover that their API access has been revoked when users complain their app does not work anymore.(Twitter story) Or sometime breaking change occurs without notice (remember Facebook APIs?). Sometimes it is the pricing options or other clauses that actually can break your app (remember Google Maps Pricing change?) because you did not read in depth the API Terms of service, so you did not prepare.<p>We intend to build a framework making API Terms of service easily shareable and understandable, under the form of a creative commons pattern composed by siple logos and warnings.
