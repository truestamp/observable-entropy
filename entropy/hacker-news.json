I accidentally ended up on Trip Advisor which asked me &quot;Is this an American restaurant?&quot;.<p>These sorts of questions seem to be a thing on some websites and on google but I never really understood what it is about. I hope some folks here might enlighten me - namely:<p>1. What motivates this from a business perspective - does this activity have a name?\n2. Are these questions asked by site visitors?\n3. Since I am local do they guess I might know?\n4. If I ask &quot;Can I buy a lawnmower here&quot; will someone get asked that?\n5. Is the data collected useful?<p>As to what qualifies something as an American restaurant I have no idea.",
