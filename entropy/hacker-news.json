      "text": "I recently wanted to register a name under the .online TLD, and found out that it was a &quot;premium&quot; name with a hefty annual price tag. The price was economically viable for me, but I abstained in fear that the owners of &quot;commercial&quot; TLDs might be free to suddenly incur a massive targeted price hike for a specific name, for example if they saw that the site became popular and was doing well, implicating it as a good subject for &quot;ransom&quot;.<p>Does anyone know of any cases of this happening, or know if this behavior would be a breach of some fundamental rules of ICANN or similar?",
