      "text": "T-mobile, victim of a recent large data breach, provides an ambiguous feature called &quot;Account Takeover Protection&quot;. This feature is intended to protect against SIM swaps.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.t-mobile.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;plans-features&#x2F;account-takeover-protection<p>There are a few issues I want to raise attention to:<p>1. TMO does not describe what these protections are.\n2. The feature is Opt-in for every line on a plan. This requires starting the click through process multiple times per #. \n3. The feature is unavailable to prepaid customers.<p>Why make this feature opt-in?\nWhy exclude this feature from prepaid plans?\nThese are abysmal security practices. Just because we are desensitized to these features doesn&#x27;t mean we should ignore the bad practices.",
