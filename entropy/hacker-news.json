We shut down everything associated with the domain a few months ago (the DO droplet and the cloudflare record).<p>However, we left the DNS pointing to cloudflare at our registrar.<p>When accessing the domain today, I noticed that it was redirected to various spam sites. Upon further inspection it looks like the DNS records were changed. There was a CNAME entry that was causing this redirect.<p>Is this some sort of security vulnerability? I can&#x27;t imagine Cloudflare or our registrar would change the records to this spam domain themselves. I&#x27;m at a loss for how this could possibly occur.",
