      "text": "Hey folks!\nI want to refurbish my old dusty blog into something new and fancy but without (too many) late nights fighting with yet another static site generator. I want to write more about my experiences working with ML so ideally this would be a tech stack that can easily accommodate maths formulae (nice if it can be a syntax close to LaTeX but I&#x27;m not super picky) and interactive graphs (something like a Jupyter notebook widget).\nDo you have a setup that works well and that you&#x27;d like to share? Thanks in advance!",
