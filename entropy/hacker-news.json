      "text": "Hi all!<p>Yesterday I saw a very strange behavior while working with some tags, I thought this was a bug!<p>Can you spot the difference? (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsfiddle.net&#x2F;vbjtcf3d&#x2F;)<p>&lt;div pagews-snapshot=&quot;true&quot; referenceid=&quot;remotemkt.listws.app&quot; snapshotid=&quot;snapshot&#x2F;board-companies&quot; &gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;<p>the other ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsfiddle.net&#x2F;q9d08xp1&#x2F; )<p>&lt;div pagews-snapshot=&quot;true&quot; referenceid=&quot;remotemkt.listws.app&quot; snapshotid=&quot;snapshot&#x2F;board-companies&quot; &gt;&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;<p>Both looks exactly the same!, but only one is working....<p>It turn out that it was an unicode character issue, the spacing between the non working tag was using the unicode non-breaking space (0xC2 0xA0), when I replaced the spaces with the regular space character (0x20) everything worked again.<p>I think that I copied this tag from an email, I will be extra careful in the future for this kind of issues.<p>It took me a while to find out this, I hope this could help anyone, if your attributes are null and you are sure that they are present check you html with a hex editor.<p>Let me know your thoughts",
