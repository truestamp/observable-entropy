I work for compute intensive AI SaaS company and that had a pretty big spike in traffic last month so now our AWS costs are at least 3x. Currently we don&#x27;t really have that manpower to manage the bill so I would appreciate any advice that you&#x27;ll throw at me. (People to follow, tools, blogs, or just any sort of general tips)<p>What we considered:\n-Spot instances, but that very short shutdown notice doesn&#x27;t sound attractive to our workloads\n-AWS savings plans, though we aren&#x27;t keen on that long term commitment\n-I&#x27;ve seen many people mention calling AWS support, so do we just bargain there to get better prices?",
