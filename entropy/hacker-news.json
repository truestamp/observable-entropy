I love using outliners, but was frustrated by what existed, so I made my own.<p>Airlist is 100% native, built with SwiftUI. It syncs across iOS, and the web (Mac app coming soon), has built in nested (AND&#x2F;OR) filters, dates, tags, backlinks, dark mode, drag and drop, and a lot more.<p>It’s free to download and try: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1572580423\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1572580423</a><p>Website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airlist.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airlist.app</a>",
