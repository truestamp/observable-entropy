      "text": "Hi HN. I&#x27;m a co-founder at a startup that is 9+ years old. Business metrics are solid, raised series C recently and have plans for IPO in the next 3-4 years. My goal has always been financial independence and to achieve that I&#x27;m looking to sell about 30% of my shares.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at possible options and got intrigued by secondary market platforms like Equity Zen and Forge Global. Has anyone here used these platforms? What was your experience like? Any advice?<p>For the context, I&#x27;m not an exec at the company. Action is in UK.<p>P.S. Sorry to post under anonymous account.",
