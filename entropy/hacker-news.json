We are glad we did so otherwise we&#x27;d have ended up spending our time &amp; money on developing something which would&#x27;ve turned out to be totally useless!<p>After receiving a good amount of feedback, we came up with  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockpay.tech ! A platform using which you can send cryptocurrencies &amp; NFTs to anyone even if they don&#x27;t have a wallet.<p>Please share your thoughts &amp; feedbacks on the same &amp; consider signing-up if you find this interesting.<p>Here&#x27;s to the new beginnings!<p>Peace.",
