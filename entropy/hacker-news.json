The obvious answers would be friends, random discovery via social media &quot;scrolling&quot; and the &quot;news.&quot;<p>But, as I look upon my foundation of what I do daily for discovery, it seems not all things are &quot;new&quot; but just &quot;new to me&quot; and then a total disconnection from what current trends, fads actually are.<p>So, HN, how do you do it?",

I&#x27;d love your help with opinions and comments.<p>I&#x27;m not in any YC batch just yet. I like the new $500k standard deal from Y Combinator because (if I were accepted to the future batch), I can then hire 10 Vietnamese employees and extend my runway to 24-27 months for better growth.<p>Here are the numbers:\n* $2.5k MRR at 15% MoM\n* target growth is 30%\n* seed raising target of $3M\n* target MRR at seed fundraising is $180k\n* might take 18 to 24 months to reach that target MRR<p>Based on the data above, I have a few questions:\n* at what dilution can I negotiate with seed investor given those number?\n* would that be in pre-money or post money SAFE\n* what else can be done to optimize leverage at seed fundraising?",
