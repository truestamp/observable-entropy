It supports seeking, which means that it can be used to stream media directly using e.g. MPV without having to wait for the download to complete.<p>I&#x27;d love to get your feedback :)",

      "text": "House construction today is still extremely expensive and labor intensive, even in an age of mass production and automation. Houses are mostly built by hand with saws and nail guns on the job site.<p>There are some companies that make modular houses in factories, but it really isn’t any cheaper to build a house that way compared to the normal methods.<p>Why is this? Is it just too expensive and cumbersome to ship large parts of a house to the job site? And are any there any disruptive construction techniques available today or in the near future that could change this?",
