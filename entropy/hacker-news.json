I have a really hard time finding time to get out on runs often enough though, and so would like to run to work and back 1 or 2 days a week.<p>I can not really plan for each day if I will stay at home or be at work though, so I need to carry my laptop with me (a 14&quot; Dell Latitude with an SSD) in my backpack.<p>I was getting worried about the wear on the laptop because of the bouncing when running though, and so I was interested to hear others&#x27; experiences:<p>- Did you get any hardware problems from running with your laptop?<p>- Have you found any solution to minimize the bouncing?<p>- Are there certain laptops that are more suitable for this than others?",

      "text": "I am almost 40 and have been working as a fullstack and frontend web developer for last 12 years as a contractor or a full-time employee for different companies. I learnt and familiar with quite a bunch of tech stack, libraries and tooling around it, using them when needed.<p>During last 3-4 years I had to end my relationship with with 3 clients&#x2F;employers due to me being slow in producing code. The reason was always - I cannot deliver as much as my colleagues could or as the employer expected me to.<p>I am good at communication. People I work with always say I am nice to work with, adding vitality to the daily team work, but eventually things go worse as I am usually slower than my colleagues.<p>I sincerely love technology, web stuff, API, structuring, organising and connecting things together, but it ultimately takes more time for me to get things done than other people.<p>The problem is quite clear to me but I don’t see the way to improve the situation. I cannot deliver faster because I already optimise everything I can. Even during the tech interviews (one was just today) I see that I don’t achieve the expected result.<p>If the time pressure is lower, at the end I deliver high-quality readable code, but the time is always the part of the formula, and I understand it, because business needs everything to be delivered faster and sooner.<p>I feel quite sad and depressed when I see how easily and quickly my colleagues get into the problems and find solutions while I have to spend more time and as a result I question myself as a professional.<p>How can I improve or should I lower my expectations for the employers and look for less-demanding lower-paying clients&#x2F;companies? Should I switch to some other tech area where the time to deliver is not the key factor (are there any)? May be there are techniques to improve my thought process?<p>Any advise is appreciated as I feel like if things keep going this way, I won’t be able to keep staying on a par with other developers around.",
