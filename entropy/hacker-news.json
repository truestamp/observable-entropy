      "text": "People used to say all kinds of things about Python&#x27;s native IDLE editor, but lately it has become a viable alternative for me to other editors like Notepad++.<p>At least on Windows, where you have no autocompletion when you launch Python inside a shell, it&#x27;s a godsend.<p>IDLE got line numbers in Python 3.8, and with that change it became good enough for most quick scripts.<p>The editor itself is highly customisable, it has a debugger and primitive auto-completion of callables and global variables. You can make your own theme or just use IDLE Dark like a normal person :)<p>So, thank you for improving IDLE! I hope it gets tabs some day, but I know that would be hard to implement.",
