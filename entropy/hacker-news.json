      "text": "I started reading <i>Learning Go</i> by Jon Bodner, and in the preface, it introduces the idea of &quot;boring code.&quot;<p>&gt; <i>When it comes to building things that last, being boring is great. No one wants to be the first person to drive their car over a bridge built with untested techniques that the engineer thought were cool. The modern world depends on software as much as it depends on bridges, perhaps more so. Yet many programming languages add features without thinking about their impact on the maintainability of the codebase. Go is intended for building programs that last, programs that are modified by dozens of developers over dozens of years.</i><p>I&#x27;m graduating soon and noticed on campus a sense of impatience. My peers are building projects with short lifespans to get into the industry, which works to get a job, but feels like starting a bad habit. &quot;Boring&quot; seems fundamental for long-lasting software.<p>How can I learn more about &quot;boring&quot; code? Perhaps even lessons from outside software, to create things that last?",
