      "text": "It seems that during the pandemic we crossed some invisible line with regard to remote working, certainly in tech adjacent fields. Remote schooling has been a much tougher nut to crack for a variety of reasons. My own kids, jr high and college age, have seen their instructors just abjectly fail at running online versions of their classes. One would think that two years in things would improve but there’s no sign of that from what I can see.<p>Is anyone here working on anything cool in EduTech that they wouldn’t mind sharing&#x2F;describing? Any thoughts on how we could improve remote and &#x2F; or hybrid learning?",
