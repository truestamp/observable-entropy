      "text": "So this has bugged me or a long time and I wanted to see if there was some reason I&#x27;m missing. According to YouTube&#x27;s docs all you have to do to enable NVR is click a checkbox in the livestream UI [0]. This would allow people to rewind&#x2F;pause&#x2F;timeshift the event. I hate that if you have a meeting or other obligation your only options are &quot;pick up where they are live&quot; or &quot;wait till the event is finished then watch it from the start&quot; (or often for me, both, watch from live then go back and see what I missed).<p>1-2 years ago the Washington Post had a copy&#x2F;feed of an Apple Event with NVR enabled and it was wonderful. I assume they made a mistake or weren&#x27;t supposed to be reproducing the feed because it only happened the one time that I noticed.<p>For the last few events I&#x27;ve taken to running this command right after the feed starts (modified for today&#x27;s event):<p><pre><code>    ffmpeg -i $(youtube-dl -f best -g &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=q5D55G7Ejs8&quot;) -c copy apple-6-6-2022.ts\n</code></pre>\nAnd then opening the ts file in VLC once I&#x27;m free but sometimes it falls over and stops working. I&#x27;d love to hear if people have other methods to accomplish this.<p>I&#x27;d also be interested to know if anyone has any insight into why Apple doesn&#x27;t allow this. The whole event is on YouTube after the feed ends, it makes no sense to me while they don&#x27;t allow people to rewind&#x2F;pause the livestream.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;9296823?hl=en",
