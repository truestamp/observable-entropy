It needs to stay the same, no matter where you are visiting the application. The only exceptions are the comments. I was testing this using Web Browser plugin.<p>I did a lot of research, but did not find a best practice. How would you solve this?<p>Currently I have created the following snippet:<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;&#x2F; To-Do: Needs to account summertime\n  public dateToUTCDate(date: string | Date): Date {\n    const time = date instanceof Date ? date.getTime() : Date.parse(date.substring(0, 10));\n    return new Date(time + new Date(time).getTimezoneOffset() \\* 60000);\n  }</code></pre>",
