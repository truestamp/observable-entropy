      "text": "So, I am currently looking for a tool that allows me to do literate programming.<p>My goal is to create a pen and paper RPG, kinda like D&amp;D, but simpler. I&#x27;d like to develop a Python module along with it which allows me to test and balance the mechanics of the game -- maybe even use it during play sessions to keep track of data. I want to try the literate programming approach here, writing down the rules of the game along with creating the module.<p>While I&#x27;ll be using Python as programming language, I&#x27;d rather avoid anything notebook related. I just don&#x27;t like the concept of notebooks and would rather create a typical module, that can also be viewed&#x2F;rendered as HTML. Would be great if the tool is language agnostic though.<p>Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText are okay. I know org-mode is a common recommendation, but I am not an Emacs guy and org-mode support isn&#x27;t that great in other editors.<p>Typesetting equations using LaTeX syntax is a bonus, but certainly not required. LaTeX as output format is not required at all.",
