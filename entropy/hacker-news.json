But at my full time job it&#x27;s not always possible due to different reasons =\\<p>So I&#x27;ve been posting random UI&#x2F;UX staff on Twitter, then I made a free book that had 50 tips (posted it here as well).<p>I decided to finish this year by collecting everything I learned and here it is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akcium.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;ui-ux-tips.<p>This time it&#x27;s a paid one. But, you can check ~20 pages of it, just go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akcium.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;ui-ux-tips-sample, put 0 in the price and download it for free.<p>I tried to illustrate almost every tip and provide some additional links.<p>This is especially useful for devs and founders who cannot afford a designer or just want to make their UI look decent.",
