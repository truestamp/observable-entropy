      "text": "Hi, I am a software developer in my early 20s and have a degree in Computer Science. Most developer jobs (including my current job) seem to be just about using frameworks to build and maintain apps as per the requirements, with the difficult stuff mostly abstracted away by frameworks.<p>I do not find this very interesting, and over the next few years, I want to transition to jobs involving design and implementation at the lower-level of the tech stack, or in other words, I want to work on the (mostly open-source) low-level infrastructure instead of a commercial app. Some recent examples of such low-level work I can think of, are: Linux kernel development, sanitizers and static analysis in GCC and Clang, new languages and their compilers and tools (Rust, Go, WebAssembly, etc), regular improvements in web browser engines, databases features.<p>I would appreciate any advice on how to transition to this kind of work, given that such jobs are very few in number and require highly specialized knowledge, compared to a generic app developer role.<p>PS. I am outside the US.",
