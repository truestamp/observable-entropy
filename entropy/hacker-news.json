      "text": "Hey folks!<p>I built Echo Prof (echoprof.com) for mobile (iOS&#x2F;Android). It&#x27;s an app for studying that you can talk with. Basically, Echo Prof says a word out loud, and you can answer by speaking (there&#x27;s language support for many languages). Then Echo Prof keeps track of what questions you should review the most often.<p>I think lots of people would like the app if they knew it existed (evidence is that Anki community is large, Duolingo community is large).<p>I&#x27;m looking for help to take the app to next level. I&#x27;ve been coding it for a couple years now, and I think I&#x27;m at a point where I can&#x27;t really take the app much further on my own. Does anyone have any advice for finding a teammate or part-owner? It would be really helpful if I could find someone who could do a bit of marketing and maybe some design work.",
