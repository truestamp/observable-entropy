      "text": "Rarely use reddit. I loath the Orwellian culture. One thing I do like about reddit is the ability to register a non verified account and quickly ask a technical question about a niche topic and get responses often within the hour. I don&#x27;t have a stack exchange account and I expect if I did it would be a longer latency to response.<p>To my chagrin I recently have discovered that whenever I create a throwaway reddit account posts made from it are shadowbanned. even on a different IP address or a different device that belongs to me. This is ridiculous. I have no idea why I am shadowbanned. I should not need to go to a library to ask a technical question on reddit.",
