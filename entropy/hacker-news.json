      "text": "So I am trying to get internet service for my dad. He stays in South Florida. The community he lives in doesn&#x27;t have internet and everyone has to use mobile Hotspot or hubs, internet service through towers as opposed to fiber optics. The area is congested so the internet speed reminds me of dial up. I&#x27;ve talked to the front office and asked what service is provided here, and they said ATT. I call ATT they say Xfinity and ATT are the only ones who provide service to that area but for some reason not the community.  XFINITY says that two other companies own the area, Spectrum and Atlantic Broadband. I go to their websites and they both redirect me to Xfinitys website and have me search there to see if service is available. The Xfinity representative told me Spectrum or Atlantic isn&#x27;t owned by Xfinity, and as I suspected, they aren&#x27;t owned but they clearly work together at least on a level that deals with web coding. So these companies control the area and are also unable to service here, yet right across the street they used to have Xfinity Representatives trying to sell their services in Wal-Mart. Are companies legally lower to do this? Force people onto mobile networks and Hotspots, not allowing high-speed internet?",
