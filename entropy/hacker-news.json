      "text": "Like any young startup, we&#x27;re iterating fast towards product-market fit. What we&#x27;re sometimes struggling with is the validation of new ideas. Once we have a great new idea, we always tend to immediately try to implement the first prototype and test it on the market (jumping to the next fancy and exciting thing). This comes at the opportunity cost of not working on the main (and sometimes less exciting) items in the backlog.<p>I want to introduce a decision-making framework to avoid this.\nThe rough idea:<p>- Formulating a hypothesis<p>- Existing evidence that supports this hypothesis (quantitative or qualitative)<p>- Explaining the opportunity and the way to validate the hypothesis<p>- Success criteria<p>At a team meeting, the person with the new exciting idea would need to &quot;defend&quot; it, and we would vote on whether another backlog item gets replaced with this new feature.<p>How are you handling this at your startup or company?",
