So far we had a single team doing both ops and datehousing work.<p>Now management is planning to split the team and I have options to choose which team to join.<p>1. In Datawarehousing team, I will get promoted to Senior by end of this year and get salary raise. Also, I can get role of data architect.<p>2. In Data ops team, as my Python and Docker skills are not upto the mark, I have to wait till next year for salary hike.<p>I want to work as Developer and I think Python and Docker knowledge will help in long term. But I can grow faster in Datawarehousing and heard data architect pays well.",
