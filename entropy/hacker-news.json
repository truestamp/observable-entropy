      "text": "I&#x27;m curious to know the best practices or how everyone manages their process and CI pipelines for CloudFormation.<p>Some common problems I struggle with in AWS CloudFormation:<p>- Only 1 set of changes for a stack can be run at once. This means if multiple devs are deploying changes then they have to wait and incorporate previous changes before they can provision their templates.<p>- Not more than 1 person can be testing on staging at once. If Dev A successfully provisions resources and Dev B didn&#x27;t pull new changes then Dev B may undo Dev A&#x27;s work. This commonly happens in staging.<p>- There&#x27;s so much iterative work required to test if a template provisions everything successfully. What may work in a sandbox may not work in staging. Testing in staging seems necessary, but leads to the previous problems.<p>- Some rollbacks around ECS may hang for hours before timing out. Thankfully, this has only happened in staging, but I don&#x27;t believe there was a kill switch? I think there was a way to stop the update from the AWS console, but granting access to that defeats the purposes of having a CI to manage your provisioning.<p>Thoughts and suggestions?",

      "text": "Like the title says I am graduating with a CS degree soon. As I am in my final year, I am getting a bit worried that my resume is kind of uninteresting.<p>I&#x27;ve applied at probably 3-4 dozen places through my school&#x27;s job board over the past month and have received zero responses. These are applications for entry level and internship positions. I&#x27;m worried my resume just doesn&#x27;t standout. I only have a couple projects under my belt and no other professional experience.<p>How can I stand out to recruiters and employers? What can I do to improve my resume? I&#x27;ve worked with many different technologies but I&#x27;m afraid because I haven&#x27;t bothered to work on mastering any of them that an employer wouldn&#x27;t wanna take the risk on me being able to learn their stack.",
