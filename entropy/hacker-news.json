      "text": "I woke up this morning to a mountain of newsletters in my primary inbox that I did not sign up for. A lot of them were for &quot;earn money by surveys&quot;-websites, but some were job listing pages and I even got some from regular, reputable, companies like Huggies (an american diaper company). The only common denominator I&#x27;ve found between all these companies is that they&#x27;re US based, or the US version of the brand.<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure what&#x27;s going on and why someone would do this, but it&#x27;s not a good feeling. I started contacting companies about removing my account and associated data as per GDPR law, but truth be told I&#x27;m not quite sure if that applies. It&#x27;s also way too time consuming.<p>This is my personal main email with gmail. I&#x27;d rather not swap, but it&#x27;s hard to wade through all the unrelated crap.<p>Has anyone been through this before? How did you solve it? What steps should I take to protect myself?",
