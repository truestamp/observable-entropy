      "text": "I am currently an ML engineer at a large fintech, working on information extraction systems. Off late, most of my work has been so atypical that I barely feel like I am an <i>ML</i> engineer.<p>I read blogs on the major engineering blogs(think GoogleAI, Uber Engineering and the likes) and I can&#x27;t help but think that the kind of work I am doing is so far behind the curve, I&#x27;ll never be able to catch up. How do you folks keep up and learn from what the best are doing?<p>It&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t follow along, but there comes a time when you can&#x27;t relate to what everyone else is doing. For eg, feature stores are all the rage right now, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me imagine why&#x2F;how since my use case doesn&#x27;t really demand it. This has started to affect my ability to interview at the best places, and is slowing me down.<p>What strategies do you all use to keep up and stay informed?",
