I don&#x27;t think it is too demanding since it will be games like AOE2, SC:BW, UT2004, Stardew Valley, Quake 3, Minecraft, nothing too demanding. Games that are on one screen It would be a cool pick up and play system, I am not tied to any of the ideas I would like ideas for a portable server that can play PC games together easily would be like and maybe some suggested games. Games like SSB:M could be done on one screen.",

      "text": "I am in the current session of Hack Reactor. Galvanize has basically removed all Hack Reactor branding from the instructional content. Hack Reactor no longer offers any in-person courses or an SF campus.[1]\nThere appear to be about 30 students in the course, in the entire Western US (not just CA). They literally can&#x27;t fill sessions. The internal Slack is completely dead.<p>Galvanize has also killed off their data science courses, which they presumably wouldn&#x27;t if they were going well.[2]<p>Worst of all, the material so far hasn&#x27;t been updated in at least 10 years, judging by the dates on the latest commits. We&#x27;re learning early 2000&#x27;s Doug Crockford-style JS. I wonder if the rest of the course material is like this, too.<p>The course still costs ~$20K.<p>Is Hack Reactor basically dead? Are there any Bay Area bootcamps that are a better deal and offer industry networking or employer contacts?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackreactor.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shift-to-remote-software-engineering-education<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.galvanize.com&#x2F;galvanize-winds-down-data-education-programs&#x2F;",
