      "text": "Hi guys! We just launched a thing that&#x27;ll change your way you think about marketing. As marketing agencies veterans we didn&#x27;t like the world where company owner instead of growing their business had to learn about marketing or educate themselves to even understand, what agency is going to offer. That&#x27;s why we developed Digital First AI, an AI community-based recommendation platform, which is going to plan and execute marketing strategy adequate to your business characteristics. We&#x27;re developing features such as: product market fit validation, marketing tactics recommendation based on AI, AI generated content. Our northern star goal is to create one-click marketing platform.\nRight now we&#x27;re doing presale - you can get 12 months (every update included) in the price of one so $99 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presale.digitalfirst.ai). It&#x27;s worth to check is, especially that you can open your account for free (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.digitalfirst.ai&#x2F;sign-up) without adding your credit card and we offer 3 months refund policy - no questions asked.\nWe are also looking for growth hackers to cooperate in terms of content monetization and affiliate program - if you&#x27;re interested, just let me know. Btw, I&#x27;ll be freaking grateful for every feedback you can give. THANKS!",
