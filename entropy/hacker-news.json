      "text": "Introducing Bartr (mybartr.com) an online platform where anyone can trade&#x2F;swap anything they own for whatever they would like in return from other users in the Bartr community.<p>But it doesn’t end there. If you don’t want anything in return, you can give your stuff out (or donate) through Bartr. It really is that simple.<p>Some people may wonder why? Why is this platform needed? The easiest answer is, in a world where nearly every human transaction has been monetised, Bartr wants to help us get back to what makes us truly special: our ability to love; and what better act of love is there than giving?<p>Might it be the corniest answer you’ve ever heard? Probably. But is it true? Absolutely.<p>The common thing people might think when they see Bartr is &quot;it’s not for me because I don’t have anything to swap or donate&quot;; but Bartr is more than that, it’s also discovery.The true value of of Bartr is visiting the platform and instantly seeing what items people around the world are willing to part with, are willing to exchange.<p>- A storied pendulum clock.\n- A sweater knitted by a grandma in Yorkshire.\n- Pokeman cards.\n- A 5 year old’s first painting.\n- Freshly baked brownies from the nice girl in your estate.<p>These are deeply personal items people own or have created, and may be willing to give away, out of the kindness of their heart— this is where the true power of Bartr lies.<p>So please sign up on our web app (mybartr.com) and join us on our incredible journey to restore humanity in transactions.<p>Oh and one more thing: the utility of Bartr is only limited by your imagination.<p>- Michael Enearu, Co-founder @Bartr",
