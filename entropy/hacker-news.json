      "text": "Every parser&#x2F;interpreter&#x2F;compiler tutorial has you start with a tokenizer. Intuitively it makes sense that you would slice off this piece of work up front.<p>But in practice, in my hobby projects, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s trivially easy to skip this step and just operate directly on characters in the recursive-descent pass. And by doing so your code is simpler, and you avoid repeating a bit of work (for example: identifying the bounds of a number literal in one pass and then fully parsing it in another pass).<p>Is it more necessary in full-scale compilers? Is it an old-fashioned practice that people don&#x27;t really do anymore? Or am I missing something?",
