      "text": "Hi everyone.<p>My cofounder and I had been working on a startup for a little while and thought, you know, let&#x27;s apply to YC. Since then we&#x27;ve killed that idea (for various reasons) but on Friday we got an invite to a YC interview. What should we do?<p>The current plan is just to say at the start of the interview &quot;Hey we pivoted to this new business, lets talk about that instead&quot;. It&#x27;s quite a large pivot - basically we realised what we were working on was going to be too small and ultimately our traction dried up, so we looked at problems we&#x27;d had along the way and found something we were more passionate about and probably better suited to build. We have good (imo) traction on this new business, considering we&#x27;ve only been working on it for like 3 weeks.<p>Would love some advice here! Surely we can&#x27;t be the first this has happened to!",
