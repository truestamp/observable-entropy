      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;ve a lot of repositories on my local machine and previously I was using Project Manager extension, but I had some issues with it -<p>- It was kind of slow.\n- It showed ignored repositories.\n- It was not completely open source. \n- There was no automated grouping for repositories.<p>So, I ended up creating my own that does everything above. It&#x27;s still in early stage but I use it on daily basis. While it&#x27;s does not have all features of project manager, It takes around 50 ms to detect all repositories inside my home directory. It is powered by a bundled rust binary that does the all the heavy lifting.<p>For those looking for source code -<p>extension - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mohitsinghs&#x2F;vscode-repo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mohitsinghs&#x2F;vscode-repo</a>\nbundled binary - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mohitinghs&#x2F;repo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mohitinghs&#x2F;repo</a><p>I hope it helps someone else as well.",

Clearly they fed the full article to Google bot and Google news, but then show a different page, sans article content, to web users.<p>Is this a violation of Google search policy?  If yes, does Google even care enough to enforce it?<p>I think this sort of publisher behavior makes for a hostile and overall very poor user experience.<p>..
