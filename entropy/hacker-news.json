Then it became &quot;Hacker News&quot; and about &quot;Anything that good hackers would find interesting&quot;.<p>Not sure what everyones definition of a &quot;good hacker&quot; is. But somehow I would expect more outlandish topics then all the discussions about corporate software jobs and tools we see.<p>Is there a smaller communitiy somewhere, where less &quot;normies&quot; with normal jobs hang out and more founders and makers? Maybe a community where you have to show what you are building before you can enter?",
