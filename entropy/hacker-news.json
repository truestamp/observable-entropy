I&#x27;ve asked for them to add flexible 1&quot; conduit from attic to each room, for future fishlineing, and they&#x27;ve upgraded from CAT5 to CAT7 at my request. This is the boundary of knowledge. -- I want to make sure there&#x27;s future proofed ability to upgrade in the event a local ISP gets fiber to the home, or otherwise better than copper.<p>Where should I go to learn more? Any basic tips or best practices? They will be foam spraying in a few days so I&#x27;m on a bit of a deadline to brush up,  not concerned with budget or all the bells and whistles as I am making future upgrades easier or possible.<p>Thanks !",
