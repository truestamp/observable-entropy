      "text": "I’m getting so frustrated with Airbnb. I logged in one day to find out my account has been blocked. No transactions, no suspicious activity, just blocked for unknown reasons. I’ve opened cases with Airbnb review team, I’ve called in to their support line, sent emails but no response. I’ve been a customer since 2012 and the lack of customer service or follow up is appalling. I’ve asked around and it seems like this is actually a common issue where many folks are randomly banned with no recourse.",
