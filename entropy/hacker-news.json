      "text": "Hi HN,<p>A friend of mine is based in Colorado, has raised a seed round, and is moving his startup to the Bay Area. He&#x27;s deciding between Palo Alto and San Francisco, and since I have only lived&#x2F;worked in SF I don&#x27;t have any decent advice to offer on the PA front.<p>Anyone able to articulate the pros&#x2F;cons?<p>Palo Alto is the Stanford hub, with a strong bet on student recruitment pipelines. On the other hand, I imagine most people want to move to a city after graduating. San Francisco is a world class community, so it seems hard to go wrong. Capital is abundant in both (and online). Both seem like good options...",

I use that for my RAW photo backup.<p>What do you think about that, i&#x27;m interested by another point of view. Perhaps rsync.net CEO (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=rsync ?) could explain us why this lifetime plan today  ? I try to better understand&#x2F;evaluate the interest of this offer.",
