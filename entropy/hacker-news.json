It was nice because it would actually <i>push</i> the data. Now I use AirDroid which is really clunky on Windows.<p>Apple has AirDrop, but that doesn&#x27;t help with my Windows (gaming&#x2F;primary) computer.<p>Why is there no easy LAN protocol or software for sharing stuff between all my machines like URLs, pictures, files that crosses the OS&#x2F;Company boundary?<p>Does anybody know of something that works well between iOS devices, Windows, and OS X that&#x27;s better than AirDroid?",
