We replaced this with team &quot;among us&quot; games, which was very engaging and everyone enjoyed. Our team grew, and we outgrew among us (more than 15 people on the team now, larger among us games didn&#x27;t work well) and I&#x27;m looking for some larger scale ~15 - 30 person games we can play together. Pretty open to any suggestions here.",
