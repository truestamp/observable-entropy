      "text": "I&#x27;m the founder of Sparrow (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sparrowstartup.com&#x2F;), a platform where startups get 1:1 growth advice from founders with exits and high ARRs. I&#x27;m an empathetic, no-BS guy and intend to be like that with you throughout. So please tell me what&#x27;s on your mind.<p>Sparrow&#x27;s making revenue but not enough to pay you a 5-figure salary. We can work out a compensation structure that works for you and openly talk about it - I&#x27;m a fair person.<p>A few requests:<p>- Be honest. If you think the vision is too ambitious, just call it out. If you think I&#x27;m being stupid, just say it.<p>- Be technically sound. Ideally, you&#x27;d have a solid experience with front and back end tech. If you don&#x27;t know something that&#x27;s fine - just tell me and we can figure out a way to help you learn that within a reasonable amount of time.<p>- We&#x27;re early-stage. We cut costs and increase productivity, and do our best not to compromise on quality. Function &gt; pretty.<p>.\n.<p>What you&#x27;ll be doing:\n- Build a new website for Sparrow that accommodates startups and founders booking sessions together seamlessly without human intervention. The website must have the latest and greatest front-end tech. It&#x27;ll have the following features:\n -&gt; Calendar syncing\n -&gt; Individual dashboards for both buyers and sellers\n -&gt; Internal messaging and forum between buyers and sellers\n -&gt; Stripe Connect that allows revenue split between Sparrow and sellers<p>- Find ways to optimize the users&#x27; experience including and not limited to:\n -&gt; How the buyers sign up and book sessions\n -&gt; How sellers are onboarded and interact with buyers<p>.\n.<p>If you&#x27;ve read this far, then you&#x27;ve probably figured out I&#x27;m the operational, non-technical, customer-facing founder. I&#x27;ll take all that work off your plate so you can focus on building the scalable tech that&#x27;ll make our customers&#x27; lives easier so they fall in love with you. I genuinely want you to be happy about what you&#x27;ll build!<p>If you want to know how I think and how much I love this project, read here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sparrowstartup.com&#x2F;purpose<p>If you want to get in touch, either use this website or just send me a ping here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sparrowstartup.com&#x2F;get-in-touch<p>I need a partner I can count on. And I want to think I&#x27;ll find him&#x2F;her soon.",
