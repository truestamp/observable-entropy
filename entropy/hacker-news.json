I used to be a developer and I am currently a member of a support team for a biggish company.<p>I have recently been getting a lot of exposure to admin level security work like dealing with Active Directory&#x2F; SSL etc. I am not sure if becoming an expert in this field would pay off long term. I have read from other posts on HN that security field pays well but its a vast field with many diverse roles and it is not clear what these roles do and what they get paid.<p>I will be extremely grateful if someone can throw some light on which security related roles &#x2F; skills are desirable to have and would make one attractive to FAANG companies.",

      "text": "Senior developer here. This is kind of a weird question, hopefully somebody has experienced something like that and has any suggestion.<p>I realized that on my daily workflow I make a lot of simple mistakes, sometimes syntax errors, or entering the wrong value of a constant,...  the kind of problems I cannot just catch by running a linter. That&#x27;s never been a huge deal as I usually can test things locally and fail fast before sharing my work with other people, so I just got used to work in a tight trial and error loop.<p>Recently I started a new position at an organization where even deploying to dev environments requires an approval process and I can&#x27;t test or reproduce things locally. In this scenario my silly mistakes are costly in terms of time and reputation, as I have to frequently resubmit the PR and start the process again.<p>So basically I&#x27;m looking at some ideas or tips for &quot;getting things right at the first time&quot;.",
