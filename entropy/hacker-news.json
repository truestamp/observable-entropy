      "text": "Hi HN Community. I used to be a developer and I am currently a member of a support team for a biggish company.<p>I have recently been getting a lot of exposure to admin level security work like dealing with Active Directory&#x2F; SSL etc. I am not sure if becoming an expert in this field would pay off long term. I have read from other posts on HN that security field pays well but its a vast field with many diverse roles and it is not clear what these roles do and what they get paid.<p>I will be extremely grateful if someone can throw some light on which security related roles &#x2F; skills are desirable to have and would make one attractive to FAANG companies.",

      "text": "Senior developer here. This is kind of a weird question, hopefully somebody has experienced something like that and has any suggestion.<p>I realized that on my daily workflow I make a lot of simple mistakes, sometimes syntax errors, or entering the wrong value of a constant,...  the kind of problems I cannot just catch by running a linter. That&#x27;s never been a huge deal as I usually can test things locally and fail fast before sharing my work with other people, so I just got used to work in a tight trial and error loop.<p>Recently I started a new position at an organization where even deploying to dev environments requires an approval process and I can&#x27;t test or reproduce things locally. In this scenario my silly mistakes are costly in terms of time and reputation, as I have to frequently resubmit the PR and start the process again.<p>So basically I&#x27;m looking at some ideas or tips for &quot;getting things right at the first time&quot;.",

      "text": "I recently started refreshing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms and discovered that I actually really enjoy the subject. Studying the Union-Find data structure, for example, has really helped me rediscover the joy of programming.<p>After a few years in the industry, I have mostly accepted that most programming jobs these days are &quot;lego programming&quot;, in the sense that we don&#x27;t really use &quot;computer science&quot; knowledge in our day jobs, we mostly just connect API&#x27;s and write business logic. I&#x27;ve mostly come to terms with this. But a couple of times a year, I start to wonder if there are any jobs these days that are more than just &quot;lego programming&quot;.<p>So the question: does anyone here have a job in which the code they write is more &quot;computer science&quot; and less &quot;lego programming&quot;?<p>My hope with this question is to have a few modern examples of interesting computer science roles in industry, rather than reignite the old &quot;all we do is CRUD&quot; pity party.",
