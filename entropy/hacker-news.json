      "text": "Hi!<p>I&#x27;ve created a physical coin for a village where people could buy with it on the stores. Tourists bought it not only for use also to have it as a remembering of the village. I ended up making thousands on an old blacksmit-mill. The story behind is powerful, hundreds of years ago people from the village, bought, to the King, their land and got free. With their own jurisdiction and governance. Here in Spain.<p>Now that I&#x27;m into learning Solidity, I would like to create a Token that represents this coin on the crypto scene. For this, would appreciate any help giving me any advice where to start. I already found some great resources to create tokens. But none of type transactional.<p>So as I said any help will be appreciated",
