      "text": "I love my job as a data scientist, it&#x27;s incredibly creative and a lot of fun. But at the end of the day I&#x27;m pretty much done with staring at code snippets and reading documentations. The same is true for the weekends - ever since I started to code for work, my motivation to code outside of it rapidly fell towards absolute zero.<p>The problem is that I have a few private projects that I would love to try out. They all need coding. How do you find the motivation to work on such things when you also code for work?<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s probably a healthy thing to pursue completely diverse activities professionally and privately, but at the same time I feel like not honing one&#x27;s professional skills during your time off is a little bit of a wasted opportunity.",
