      "text": "Solar panels, electric vehicles - we are supposed to dramatically increase production of these goods, yet for years now silver mining production is decreasing. The goal of &quot;going green&quot; and output of silver mining are running in opposite directions. Also artificially low silver spot price of &quot;paper silver market&quot; (where only small percentage of contracts is actually backed by physical silver) is not helping the situation. Low silver prices means low profitability and less producers of silver concentrate.<p>Yet literally no one in tech circles seems aware of that fact (if they were they would already been buying whole silver or silver&#x2F;copper mines) and in industrial circles only silver miners seem to care. In general population I see this topic disputed mainly by r&#x2F;wallstreetsilver crowd on reddit.<p>&quot;Green politicans&quot; obviously seem to be clueless about that basic fact. In most jurisdiction it can take well over 10 years to permit and start a new mine.<p>So I do not see how we are going to all switch to electric vehicles any time soon. Especially as we most likely mine not enough copper too.<p>What is your opinion on this strange situation?",
