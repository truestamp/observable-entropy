      "text": "Roam Research is a popular note-taking app. It&#x27;s hard to say whether it&#x27;s the most popular in a competitive, but it&#x27;s got plenty of loyal supporters as shown by the number of people that suscribed to the 5-year-plan for 500 USD.<p>Recently, their lead engineer left for a YC competitor: Athens Research [1].<p>Is this as indicting as it looks? Or is it common? This engineer was in Roam for less than a year, so I don&#x27;t think his shares were vested, so this is at least a signal that he thinks the shares in Roam are going to be worth less than shares in Athens (assuming equal participation.)<p>I think this is an important question for prospective users, as they&#x27;re making long term investments not only money-wise but also because of data lock-in.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AthensResearch&#x2F;status&#x2F;1414254253124866052",
