      "text": "As the title says, I&#x27;m trying to do some analysis on web data and I need a list of IP ranges and their corresponding geo locations. Doesn&#x27;t matter if they are integers, CIDR notation, ranges or whatever.<p>I&#x27;ve looked for ages and all I can find are API&#x27;s, not downloads.<p>I only need something as close as mapping an IP to a country and region&#x2F;state, I don&#x27;t need anything that maps to Postal Codes or streets or anything that granular. So as an example an IP would show that a user came from Texas, USA or UK, England or UK, Scotland, not the street where they live or anything. I&#x27;d even take mapping IP&#x27;s to cities if that&#x27;s all I can get but no closer than that, however, I can always remove any data that is closer to the ground if needed.<p>This is a hobby project, so I can&#x27;t afford much if I have to pay, which I&#x27;m happy to do.<p>Any ideas where I can get such a thing?",
