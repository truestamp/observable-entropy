      "text": "I am a full stack dev, lots of javascript and rails experience as well as some Golang. I have very little mobile development experience. I&#x27;ve toyed with react native locally but never released anything functional. I am looking to build a prototype for mobile and release an MVP to the app stores.<p>What do you use to build prototypes and MVPs for mobile? I would like to target iOS and Android from the start. I would like to user experience to feel &quot;native&quot; as well. Other than that, looking for suggestions of approaches that are somewhat easy to pick up. Would love to hear pros and cons of the framework you use.<p>Thanks!",
