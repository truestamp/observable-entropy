      "text": "A friend works at a company that was acquired and the entire staff was demoted in title by the acquiring company.<p>Acquisition to employees meant not only a new boss, unrealized equity compensation bumps, but a title demotion. It seems more psychologically significant to me but also affects the pay scale comparable, and a speed bump in some or all career paths.<p>The private company stock options are being traded for new stock in the public acquiring company (and thus has less upward price movement expected - if anything they are overvalued at this time in the market) based on the lower-tier demotion experienced by the employees.<p>I am curious if others have had any similar experiences in acquisitions, advice, and why an acquiring team would demote the entire acquired company staff for morale reasons when acquiring IP and engineering talent? Does this signal anything about the acquiring company ethics or am I reading too much into it?",
