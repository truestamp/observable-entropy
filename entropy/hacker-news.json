I&#x27;m open to suggestions but I&#x27;m thinking of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.<p>Im really confused about which framework to use. I&#x27;m going hybrid because I need access to the filesystem and some other native things. I have limited experience with Cordova, but it looks like no one uses this anymore in favour of react or flutter. What&#x27;s the best one to go for now?",
