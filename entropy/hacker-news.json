      "text": "I work at fully remote company. We do a lot of meetings. In those meetings, people go on and on talking about complicated workflows and technical discussions. However, I&#x27;m sure most of the others don&#x27;t follow completely. Voice quality is sometimes bad. I&#x27;m sure people who work fully remote can list additional problems.<p>In physical offices, we have whiteboards that help us explain and keep others&#x27; attention, we have facial expressions that help us know when people have difficulties understanding, etc.<p>So have you discovered a tool or a way to significantly improve communication when working with a fully remote team? If so, please share your experience.",
