      "text": "Increasing tracking of smaller fonts makes them much more readable. The modern web design uses a lot of white space, so there&#x27;s rarely a penalty for doing this.<p>Go to a website, open developer tools, select a text which is smaller than body copy and add this style:<p><pre><code>    letter-spacing: 0.05em \n</code></pre>\n(Or reduce to 0.02em if the font is on the larger side).<p>It makes a lot of difference! Especially applied to text set in all caps.<p>I&#x27;ve seen tracking used extensively on Apple websites, which I guess is not surprising given their design roots.",
