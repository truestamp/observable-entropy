      "text": "The threads about FIDO and GitHub requiring 2FA have shown that many people are concerned about various issues with hardware keys. Examples are lack of convenient backup, cloud backup, privacy concerns and concerns about centralization.<p>A solution to this would be to emulate the 2FA hardware in software running on the same machine as you&#x27;re using to log in - so it is not 2FA anymore but 1FA.<p>It would be at the cost of security, but at the benefit of allowing users to keep doing as they&#x27;ve been with regular passwords.<p>So what software solutions exist for emulating things like FIDO, WebAuthN, YubiKeys, etc.?",
