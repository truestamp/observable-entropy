Many of the products I looked at were marketed as for use in aquariums or with reptiles.<p>So now Facebook is showing me ads for fish and reptile pet products. When I checked the &quot;why am I seeing this ad?&quot; page they&#x27;ve added pets, fish and reptiles to my &quot;interests&quot;.<p>The only place I&#x27;ve looked at those types of things is in the Amazon app.<p>What&#x27;s going on here?<p>P.S. I even have the global Android targeted ads setting turned off.",
