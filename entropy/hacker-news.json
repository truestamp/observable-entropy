Recently I have been doubting every move that I make and have lost all faith in myself as a developer. When I look at a new feature I just think that I will make it shitty or get called out on not doing things the &quot;right&quot; way. The thing is, I know I&#x27;m a decent developer but I find myself doubting every single decision that I make. Is this burn out? How can I get out of this funk and move on?",
