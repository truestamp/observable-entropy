      "text": "There are many reasons why people downvote comments&#x2F;posts in any community - be it HN, Reddit, Facebook, etc. I would be thankful if you could explain your reasoning for downvoting the comments when you choose to do so.<p>For example, I&#x27;ll sometimes see a massively downvoted comment that&#x27;s constructive and beautifully written, but it carries an opinion that is not currently popular for whatever reason.<p>I believe that downvoting someone just because you disagree with them is terrible for a discussion network like HN. Moreover, I would say that I learned the most from the comments that I disagreed with - on all levels, politically, technologically, personally.<p>I will downvote a comment if it&#x27;s not constructive, only written to be provocative, etc. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I agree with the author&#x27;s opinion or not. If someone puts in the effort to explain their opinion politely and constructively, my thinking is that it&#x27;s positive for all the people in the community.<p>So, what kind of a downvoter are you? What are some of your reasons for downvoting a comment?",
