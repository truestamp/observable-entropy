      "text": "If you wanted to protect a robot from gamma radiation or EMPs how would you do it?<p>There are two separate considerations: the robot&#x27;s insides (CPU, memory) and the sensors (camera, microphone).<p>For the insides you could have a solid Pb enclosure with holes for wires. It would have to be snug though. Has anyone done anything similar?<p>For the sensors it&#x27;s less clear because they by definition have to be exposed to the elements. There are robots studying Mars and the Sun (from a distance but still). Is there public information on how they are protected?",
