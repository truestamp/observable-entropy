      "text": "I tried Windows 11 and the Taskbar was unusable for me. I never group icons because it hides window titles. Rounded corners, centered Taskbar and other UI &quot;enhancements&quot; make it looks like a cheap replica of a Mac OS. Microsoft has been doing it for sometime. But it&#x27;s not just Microsoft, Google has been doing the same with Android with every new release. Samsung led the way probably.<p>Apples OS surely looks beautiful. TouchPad is pleasant to use and the file explorer has a useful multi column view. But that&#x27;s about it for me. Being a Windows user since 98 nothing else made sense to me and I don&#x27;t want to be on a Mac again.<p>So for those who have used both a lot, are Apple&#x27;s OSes more intuitive or usable when compared to other established interfaces? Why everyone is copying Apple anyway?",
