      "text": "This is NOT about a technical issue on a single computer. Its about general audio issues.<p>It is my observation, that between &quot;0&quot; (muted) and the first few percentages there is no &quot;soft&quot; transition in the computers I use: Instead volume seems to jump in like two steps to &quot;already really loud&quot;.<p>Its not easy to describe if you can&#x27;t hear it, I know, but the analog volume control wheel on my headphones manage to raise the level really well, where as the digital input of my soundbar (connected to the volume level of my pc) seem to jump from &quot;mute&quot; to a fairly audible level and then it only gets louder.<p>I&#x27;m working mostly on mac os, but windows and linux seem to have the issue, too. And its independent of the hardware (I use a Macbook, Lenovo Think Centre, HP Laptop, heck even an iPad)<p>Its like you have a scale from 0 to 100, but somehow the first 20 is missing and the increase is at first higher than later.<p>Any idea why this ist? How do you percive this? Is there a solution for better volume mangement?",
