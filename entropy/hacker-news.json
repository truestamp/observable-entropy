      "text": "I often hear developers that want more and better user stories, but are they really that great?<p>I see developers lose connection with the users, iteration momentum, urge to push feature etc. They get more focused on solving tasks than solving business need.<p>On the other side the users loose the feeling of impact and ownership of the change. After a while they don’t want to participate in another user study.<p>I came from a place where we released small features in days, got user freed back and changes again. Using data to guide every decision.<p>When looking back the “data” way gave way more business value, but the “user story” way was easier for management to see as tangible work.<p>Are we doing user stories the wrong way?",
