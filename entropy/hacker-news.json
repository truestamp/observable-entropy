And because I really don&#x27;t care which of them I use, I try to find which of them will take the least effort&#x2F;time to get working. But i&#x27;ve found myself trapped in a cycle: Every time I dig a little deeper into one solution, I find something that looks like it&#x27;d be unpleasant to deal with and I switch over to inspecting a different solution (e.g. browsing through a different library.) I&#x27;ve looped a few times now between three reasonable routes, getting a little deeper in each one each time. Does anyone else ever get caught in this kind of cycle?",

That being said, I know that that HN leans anti-Crypto and I want to make an effort to not be in an echo chamber. I saw some critical comments on other threads[2][3], but I was hoping to start this thread with the explicit goal of discussing the limitations and oversights of the video.<p>All input and perspectives are welcome, thank you!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g&amp;t=5455s\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30120437\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30049130",
