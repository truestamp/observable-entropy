      "text": "We&#x27;re Python developers who also like playing Wordle. So we created Pordle. It&#x27;s like Wordle, but letting you guess Python package names instead of English words. Every day, Pordle picks up a new package. At the end of a game, it shows the package name of the day, along with a brief intro and links to more resources. We hope to help people learn Python, one package a day. Here [1] is a video demo on how it works.<p>The entire game is implemented in a single Py file, including backend and UI, with ~150 lines of code. A beginner-friendly version of the source code can be found here[2].<p>Pordle does not copy exactly Wordle&#x27;s features. E.g., it does not support hardware keyboard, and automatic submits a guess upon completing a line. Please give it a try and let&#x27;s know how your guessing goes.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4zLWF11adJ0&amp;ab_channel=PyWebIO\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4zLWF11adJ0&amp;ab_channel=PyWeb...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pywebio&#x2F;pordle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pywebio&#x2F;pordle</a>",
