      "text": "Hi all,<p>For various reasons, I&#x27;ve been considering a transition from full-time salaried employment to freelancing. My current situation is:<p>* I&#x27;m a backend web developer in the UK with three year&#x27;s experience plus university. I&#x27;ve primarily spent my time written web server software in Kotlin and Java, although I&#x27;m comfortable writing software professionally in a couple of other languages including Python and Rust. I know enough SQL to get by but I&#x27;m far from an expert in the subject and I know my way around <i>nix servers comfortably. I&#x27;ve also done a fair amount with AWS.<p></i> I have a neurological condition that flares up unpredictably with a frequency of anything from around three to six months. This condition is poorly understood and cannot be controlled or mitigated with any known medical intervention; while I can mostly tolerate the chronic symptoms these acute episodes cannot be averted. For this reason I find working in lockstep to a traditional 9-6 schedule very stressful for obvious reasons, and permanent WFH is not an option in my current role. Freelancing sounds an ideal way to work around this problem as I&#x27;d be setting my own hours rather than working to somebody else&#x27;s schedule, meaning I&#x27;d be able to fit work around my condition rather than forcing myself to work through episodes which frankly is already leading to burnout. This neurological condition also precludes me doing UI-related work for the most part as my visual perception often differs quite strongly from the norm.<p>* I have experience with the formalities of running a limited company, as I&#x27;ve had a side project going with a couple of others which for various reasons I won&#x27;t bore you with made sense to register as a limited company in the UK rather than the other possible legal configurations. While this is obviously very different from <i>living</i> off your own limited company, I&#x27;m at least aware of what&#x27;s required to keep Companies House and HMRC happy. I&#x27;d likely be running my freelance business from the UK too, I know there&#x27;s more tax-efficient jurisdictions to set up in but I&#x27;d rather stick to what I know at first!<p>* For reasons I&#x27;ve made in another post, I&#x27;m intending to move onto a liveaboard sailing boat in the future rather than renting or buying a house. While it&#x27;s orthagonal to my main issue of dealing with a neurological condition, freelancing at least on the surface appears to lend itself much better to such a lifestyle as full-time 9-6 employment is incompatible with long ocean crossings which are a long-term ambition for me. It goes without saying that such work would have to be full-time remote.<p>Given this background, I&#x27;d really appreciate advice from anyone else who&#x27;s made the transition from traditional employment to freelance work generally, or suffered with a neurological condition as a software developer and attempted to mitigate it in this way. I&#x27;d particularly appreciate recommendations for agencies which would be a good fit for the kind of work I have in mind.<p>Cheers in advance!",
