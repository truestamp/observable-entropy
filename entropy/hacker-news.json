      "text": "Each day I encounter new concepts and techniques but rarely document them. As I see professionals being able to document even the tiniest detail or bug they find, I am surprised on how they find to do so!<p>What does it take for one to capture these kind of detail eg. mathematical background, debugging session, some new concepts, some old concepts, system design etc? With age, I feel like my memory can&#x27;t sustain the amount of information I am accumulating. Therefore, I feel like I will need to build a quick reference or memorize things as I go.<p>Normally, I do not like note keeping because my notes are never authentic to the original source. Thus they are rarely useful. I have a bad habit of going through the same source multiple times. It is highly effective but unsustainable because of the time constraint. It was well suited for college when I had time.<p>What are other alternatives for this issue? I would really like to get some insights from those who have gone through these issue or face the issue.<p>Thank you for your time!<p>Cheers.<p>PS: As we build a software, we get lot of artifacts as byproduct. I also want the snippets or highlights to be a byproduct of my work such that I will be motivated to build a proper documentation out it!",

The instrument has already been developed but I need about 500 participants to test its validity and it&#x27;s really challenging.<p>I would be very grateful if you would support me by participating in my study.<p>Here is the link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ww2.unipark.de&#x2F;uc&#x2F;PhD&#x2F;1d1a&#x2F;<p>The questionnaire is a bit long, but it is important to go till the end. Please contribute those 15-20min towards science.<p>Thank you very much!\nKind regards.",
