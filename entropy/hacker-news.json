      "text": "Hello all,<p>Curious how hard it is to move from a generic web backend engineering job to a systems programming job.<p>I am currently a junior with 1.5 YOE.  I took a few cs classes in C++ and have messed around on GitHub with C and Rust.<p>I enjoyed the extra challenge of memory management and thinking more of performance &#x2F; memory safety. While I want to try and program an emulator or some sort of systems project (recommendations welcome &#x2F; textbooks to read welcome) before I definitely decide to move into that area, I was curious how hard it is.<p>I’m sure companies aren’t thrilled to hire juniors with no systems or embedded experience.  Would it be better to move to a company with low-level programming teams as a Java dev and then transfer to those teams?  (Current employer does basically no low level work anywhere on any team)",

But getting the user agent is trivial, and so wiki should be able to easily redirect to this on a non-mobile device:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carbon<p>But they don&#x27;t, and since they&#x27;re one of the most-visited sites in the world, I assume there&#x27;s some really good reason why they don&#x27;t bother. Anybody know why that might be? Is there some sort of esoteric security thing that sites have to worry about? Do they just not want to have to do the work of serving one page and then immediately switching to the other? Or is it something else entirely?",
