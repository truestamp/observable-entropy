      "text": "I&#x27;m making the transition from a 2015 mac to a new M1 as my dev environment. I&#x27;m simultaneously pulling a long-needed upgrade on all my production web apps from much earlier versions of Typescript (2.x &gt; 4), PHP (5.x &gt; 7.4), and MySQL (5.7 &gt; 8). All updates I had held back because my dev environment had gotten too mangled to attempt any upgrades on the old machine. (Try replacing homebrew under 10.11 without wrecking everything that&#x27;s working). So that&#x27;s a lot of code to manage. Mostly it&#x27;s okay. But the hardest thing for me is... changing my IDE.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Eclipse since at least Helios (2010)... that&#x27;s the oldest one on my last machine. Same project setups ported from version to version. But the AArch version of Eclipse is not stable, and doesn&#x27;t even launch on my machine. And I&#x27;ve admired (from a distance, next to colleagues) the lovely contours of VS Code for a lot of years. So I just spent the last two days building a VS Code environment (uh, a single multi-root workspace with a lot of tsconfig files and tasks) while fixing a bazillion typescript and PHP warnings. Okay. So I got all that done. Finally zero compiler problems.<p>Now my problem is, I can&#x27;t see code. I think I&#x27;ve gone code-blind. I can look at my old laptop showing a page of typescript in Eclipse, and I know exactly what I&#x27;m looking at. I can see through the code, see what it does. I look at the same thing in VS Code and all I see is colors. I tried light mode. I tried Github theme. I tried my old fonts. I tried <i>Courier New</i>. Everything burns my eyes. I literally can&#x27;t see the significance of the code; I feel like I&#x27;m looking at some ancient codex in a foreign language. Like the Rosetta Stone. Again, exact same code in my super basic light theme in Eclipse is entirely readable. Maybe it&#x27;s the tab lines in VS Code? Or the shaded syntax highlighting? Too much visual information?<p>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has experienced this when changing editors. It&#x27;s disturbing. I actually feel like I&#x27;m losing my mind (or like someone who&#x27;s suffered a traumatic brain injury, I&#x27;ve lost the part of my brain that I rely on to infer meaning from symbols). Perhaps it&#x27;s just the fear of a major change, or a break with the past. I&#x27;m hoping that after a few days it&#x27;ll pass. I certainly never <i>loved</i> Eclipse...<p>I used to use f.lux a lot to change my screen to red-on-black only, at night. This was a fine way to code, but slightly more challenging. Maybe it&#x27;s all the colors that are screwing me up, I just need monochrome.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear anyone&#x27;s take on transitioning IDEs and whether it&#x27;s worth it to try to adjust your brain, theme-wise and color-wise. I never realized I&#x27;d gotten so attached to the visual part of moving through code. It shouldn&#x27;t be that way, but I guess it is.",

      "text": "I just started at a new job around 3 weeks ago. Technically and culturally, I am not fit for the job at all from what I can tell.<p>The whole team speaks English for me, but it is noticeably uncomfortable for everyone. They skip inviting me for lunch because they don&#x27;t want to go through same act during lunch.<p>I am a frontender with AWS and GCP experience. This whole place runs and breaths Microsoft Azure.<p>They hired me as a Frontend Lead to manage 3 other devs and external provider&#x27;s deliverables. I had no time to takeover from previous guy, because I wanted to have a break between jobs, I was burnt out.<p>I feel at a loss, at their way of working. It is a real life &quot;the office&quot; environment. A meeting titled &quot;ProjectA Mobbing&quot;, with no agenda, none takes notes or action points. Person who calls the meeting just goes on fixing IT infra while 8 people in meeting watches. Then next day, DevOps team just deleted whole development IT infra with no notice, because it was costing too much apparently, and it does indeed.<p>How do I quit nicely here? Is it too early after 3 weeks?<p>Do I say, I am unfit for this company and environment? or lie and say I have another job offer?<p>I am getting paid a stupid amount of money. But honestly, I don&#x27;t care. I can find something else easily.",
