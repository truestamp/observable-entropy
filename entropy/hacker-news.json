Basically, the users of the platform will see the service offering on the platform, but they will think it’s offered by the platform itself. The COO of a big tech company (market cap &gt;1B) is interested in integrating our product, and has referred us their head of product, but being that it’s a big company, the head of product tells us that should continue this conversation in Q2 of 2022.<p>What can I even do in this situation? I can’t get any value from them in a year or more? We don’t know if we’ll even exist a year from now.<p>Also, how do I make sure this deal doesn’t fall through after a year of waiting?",
