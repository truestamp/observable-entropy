      "text": "I&#x27;m an engineer living in SF. I was in college when FB started to become popular (2007), and I remember my more fortunate friends getting the first iteration of the iPhone. Somehow I completely missed these waves - both social and mobile.<p>I studied economics and CS in college, and initially went to McKinsey before getting into enterprise software. I&#x27;ve basically just been sitting in the lineup as others have surfed the massive social&#x2F;mobile waves over the past 10 years. Now I&#x27;m in my early 30s. I&#x27;m a pretty solid developer, and I know how to sell to customers (I&#x27;ve been in enterprise Sales Engineering for the past few years).<p>I&#x27;ve always known that I don&#x27;t want to be an employee of a big tech company for the rest of my working life. I love the Bay Area, and I&#x27;ve been drunk on the startup koolaid since I&#x27;ve been here (I&#x27;ve dabbled in startups but never started my own), and I&#x27;ve always felt like I just needed the right opportunity or idea to fully jump in and become a founder.<p>I got curious about cryptocurrencies in 2017, but didn&#x27;t buy in to the technical feasibility or the ethos. I felt vindicated during the 2018-2019 crypto winter. Now it seems like this is something that just won&#x27;t go away. So many billions of dollars have been raised by VC firms to put into crypto companies and from my perspective it seems like there is a dearth of legitimate, technical entrepreneurs in the space.<p>I still don&#x27;t fully buy into the ethos of it, but it seems like now might be the right time to paddle in and try to ride this thing. I can&#x27;t imagine that every person who got into the .com craze in the 90s was doing it out of genuine passion and interest for the technology - they saw an opportunity and they took it, and maybe they made a decent chunk of money, or at least built an entrepreneurial foundation - that&#x27;s the thing about living in the Bay Area.. even if you fail as an entrepreneur, you still get respect for doing it.<p>So even though I don&#x27;t particularly care about crypto, I have to recognize that I don&#x27;t particularly care about enterprise software either... so why not crypto? Maybe this is my last chance at catching a really good wave.",
