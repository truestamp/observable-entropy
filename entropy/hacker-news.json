      "text": "I watch a lot of YouTube. Most days a few hours, so they have a lot of data on what I watch. My google account is ancient, It&#x27;s been with me since the start of gmail and became a YT account when they took over. Lately the recommendations that I get are a lot more repetitive than they used to be. I get recommended the same videos over and over, sometimes I even get recommended things I would never have seen in my feed years ago - things that are of no interest that used to be outside of my bubble for the longest time. I also see tons of videos that I know that I have watched being marked as un-watched and recommended again and again. I don&#x27;t know if this is imagined of if their algorithms have become terrible lately. Anyone else have this feeling?",
