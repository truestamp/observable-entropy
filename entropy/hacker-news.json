      "text": "Hi, I am Hunter, co-founder of Grouphub Technology. I have been working on this website Grouphub: www.grouphub.app for months and I am really excited to share it with you.<p>Grouphub is a cross-platform website that compiles group chats on Groupme, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack and Others. For this version, it is exclusively for college students. Students can find and share group chat invitation links with others from the same college. Grouphub is a community in and of itself, as people can follow each other and keep up with the group chats being uploaded.<p>I hope this website could help people get connected with others in the same community. Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add. Thanks.<p>Website: www.grouphub.app",
