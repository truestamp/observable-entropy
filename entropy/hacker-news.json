      "text": "Hey!  I&#x27;m Mike and I&#x27;m writing my first tutorial on how I learned how to build Pokemon Games.  It&#x27;s a work in progress, and I&#x27;ll be posting updates here, but I&#x27;m excited to take on this challenge!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikercampbell.gitbook.io&#x2F;gotta-code-them-all&#x2F;<p>Whenever I learn a new language, framework, design pattern, or technology I build a Pokemon Game in it.  My goal is to use everyday technology like Node.js, Elixir, Go, Postgres, Redis, React, and others to show you how to build Pokemon Games in a way that you could apply the concepts discussed in any other technology.<p>The Course is broken up into Main Quests and Side Quests, where Main Quests include everything you need to build a game, where Side Quests delve into architectural and scalability, such as Caching, Graph Databases, Web Assembly, etc., and things that I&#x27;m just curious about so you can see me use these principals to learn Tech in realtime.<p>In the end, you will have a Real-time, playable, deployable Pokemon Game clone, with varying degrees of parody depending on what Main Quests and Side Quests you choose to work on.<p>I published my first Chapter (or as I call them Routes), and am looking for feedback and advice, as I&#x27;ve never done this before!<p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to do something like this for some time, as I would really like to get into Developer Relations, so I have the goal of getting good at this, and feedback would go a long way.<p>It was this thread (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32093879) that inspired me to take that first step!",
