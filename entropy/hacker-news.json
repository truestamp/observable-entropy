      "text": "My dad dug up an old (analog) photo, carefully took a picture with their phone, and sent it to me. I uploaded it to Google Photos and noticed it set the location to where he digitized it, not where the original photo was taken. No problem; I know how to update a photo&#x27;s location... but apparently at some point in the past year, Google decided to block users from doing this?<p>A number of people have noticed, and asked Google for an explanation, or even just asked the Internet in general for speculation, but so far, there seem to be no answers, or even guesses:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=%22google+photos+can%27t+edit+locations+added+by+your+camera%22<p>What&#x27;s even weirder is, I can delete the photo from Google, update its location on my machine, and then upload it, and that works just fine. I can even delete the metadata, upload it, and <i>then</i> Google is happy to allow me to set the location. But that&#x27;s a pain.<p>So, HN, can anyone here guess what possible reason Google could&#x27;ve had for this bizarre product&#x2F;policy change?",
