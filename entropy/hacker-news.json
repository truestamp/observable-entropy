      "text": "Hi everyone, I am Sarah. from Poland I want to use this medium to appreciate Dr Aluya the great black magic death spells caster for the successful death spells he cast on someone for me. I contacted him when my husband left me for another woman who uses witchcraft power to take my husband. I was desperately in need of help when I found his contacts online about his genuine powers. I told him my situation and how I wanted the bitch who took my husband gone. He told me not to worry. He cast the death spells ritual on her and the bitch died in her sleep within 24hours. Now my husband is back home and we are living happily. Thank you so much Dr Aluya You are so real and true. Below is his contacts in case you want to contacts him\nCall&#x2F;WhatsApp: +2349052066081 Email: draluyaspells@gmail.com",
