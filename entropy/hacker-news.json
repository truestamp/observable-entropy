      "text": "Hi I&#x27;m Chris, a developer based in London.<p>EazyPay.me is simple invoicing software.<p>You can create invoices using templates, share them via email, direct link and pdf. And recently I added getting paid electronically via invoices.<p>I created EazyPay.me because from personal experience, invoicing software comes loaded with features I don&#x27;t need. Also, my Dad still hand delivers printed out invoices and a friend of mine said he just wants to get notified when he get&#x27;s paid.<p>I&#x27;m monetising EazyPay.me by charging a subscription for additional features and more usage (more invoice for example). And also charging a fee on invoices paid electronically.<p>I&#x27;ve gone with a fremium model as I want to gather feedback fast, but I&#x27;m open to trying a free trial.<p>It&#x27;s still early but I have just over a thousand sign ups, the vast majority of which are still free.<p>Any feedback would be massively appreciated! Like I mentioed above, there&#x27;s a free tier so you can take a look around for free. \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eazypay.me&#x2F;?source=hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eazypay.me&#x2F;?source=hn</a><p>Thanks,<p>Chris",
