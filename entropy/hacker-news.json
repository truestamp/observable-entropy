For long and irrelevant reasons, I went a different route days before the invasion. That said, I have worked with Ukrainians in the past and they were all amazing people. Likewise, I absolutely loved the people I met in this company albeit over a video call. In addition being from and living in a country which has suffered immensely from Russia over the past almost two centuries, I feel like it&#x27;s my duty to share our last two emails(redacted for obvious reasons):<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;eW8LNWs.png<p>With that, I want to address all free people on this planet: they need help.",
