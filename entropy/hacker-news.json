      "text": "Hey there, I live in Germany and here I need to print a lot of stuff, coupons, government stuff etc. So we had a normal home Epson printer and I just had to throw it away (with tears in my eyes) because the inkpad is dirty and fixing it isn&#x27;t recommended and it is also locked in the firmware. I don&#x27;t mind to pay more money, I just don&#x27;t want to throw stuff away all the time.<p>I can&#x27;t believe it is 2022 and companies can&#x27;t build a fucking printer that you don&#x27;t need to throw it completely away and just replace the parts that end up having issues. Is a printer such hard thing to make?<p>Am I crazy? It is hard to believe for me we are progressing as a society when everything is made with planned obsolescence. Shouldn&#x27;t it be the opposite?<p>Can&#x27;t maybe YC fund a company that tries to shift around this planned obsolescence economy? I already had to throw away so many things: washing machines, printers, TVs... so many!<p>I can&#x27;t believe we have even reusable rockets but can&#x27;t build a fucking printer that we can pass to different generations on our family and our future human beings can just replace some parts and keep it going.<p>HN, I think that together I believe we can change this. TELL ME HUMANITY IS BETTER THAN THIS.<p>Do you have any recommendations of printers that don&#x27;t make me throw a few kilos of plastic away?<p>Thanks HN!",
