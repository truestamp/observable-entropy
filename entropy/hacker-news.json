Not even gift vouchers. No promises should be made either.&quot;<p>This sounds a bit crazy.<p>Now of course these aren&#x27;t world class geniuses.<p>But how can so many people be convinced to give away their labor for free while a company make money off them?<p>And why isn&#x27;t anyone proposing a better solution to these people?<p>This is probably the most unbelievable business model I&#x27;ve ever heard of",
