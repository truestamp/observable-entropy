      "text": "Do any developers here work with VDI-like solutions (virtual desktop, virtual machine, remote accessible, usually with some sort of graphical client like Citrix or RDP) in their day to day job? How much freedom or not do you have in running your own tools, install your own software, IDEs, compilers, containers, etc?<p>Or is it usually a heavily locked down environment? What about performance (especially in larger environments where the VDI platform is shared with potentially many developers?<p>Looking for experiences good and bad.<p>Personal experiences and those of colleagues have been universally horrible and our team is being forced to work on yet another incarnation of this, whilst we are currently happily working BYOD style. Thanks in advance for any shared (horror or uplifting) stories.",
