We&#x27;ve just launched a photo upload feature that allows rock climbers to upload and share climbing photos. Ultimately, we hope climbers find the Wiki site useful, and stick around to help us improve the climbing route database, which, by the way, is freely available under the public domain license.<p>Would you upload photos of a rock wall and let others freely use your photos in anyway they wish (including commercial purposes)?<p>If you&#x27;re active on GitHub, please share your feedback on RFC 307: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenBeta&#x2F;open-tacos&#x2F;issues&#x2F;307<p>thank you!",
