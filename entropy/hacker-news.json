      "text": "Ask HN: Anyone using f2fs in real-life scenarios?<p>I&#x27;ve test-run f2fs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;F2FS) on several laptops and various devices booting from external USB&#x2F;MMC devices in the past month. The subjective perception of the change in performance (from standard ext4) is evident. I was thinking very seriously about changing all my non-HDD-based devices to f2fs when I stumbled upon this:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;atc19-jaffer.pdf<p>Basicaly, it says that f2f2s doesn&#x27;t do as much checking for hardware errors as ext4 and tends to fail silently when there&#x27;s a problem with the physical medium. This worries me and makes me want to stop using it - but the paper in question is more than a couple of years old and f2fs has continued to evolve, patches have been submitted to the Linux kernel and so on.<p>Anyone using f2fs care to share his&#x2F;her experience with it?",
