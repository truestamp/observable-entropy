      "text": "What I&#x27;ve gathered from my limited reading and research is the following:<p>1. The universe is fundamentally infinite and continuous, both on a macro and micro scale (infinitely large, and infinitely divisible)<p>2. Observation on a scale currently available to humanity interprets the continuous and infinite as finite and quantifiable - some information is lost in the process. A piece of reality we call an electron is shot at an another one, and we have learned how to observe the displacement of those pieces.<p>3. Quantum superposition is nothing but a translation of the reality of continuous fields into our quantifiable domain.<p>4. Measuring collapses the probability fields in a sense that no other way of measuring is available for us other than interpreting the continuous as a quantifiable and losing information in the process.<p>5. By repeating measurements and mapping the distribution out, we can get a rough estimate of the field that is observable through the interaction that we are using for measuring.<p>How far off am I? \nWhat are some good resources to read up on to deepen my understanding of what we currently know?<p>Thanks.",
