      "text": "Hello!<p>I&#x27;m learning Rust and also information security, so what better way to learn than to put a tool together practicing both skills?<p>I&#x27;ve tried to use a couple of different tools for subdomain enumeration (part of the Discovery-party when it comes to penetration testing), but none of them were very fast, even if the DNS resolver I pointed them towards is, so I wrote my own tool that leverages concurrency to check a lot of subdomains, fast!<p>It&#x27;s written in Rust, main parts being using Tokio and async_channels, and I think it works good enough for a first release. I wanted to get recursive subdomain enumeration to work too, but couldn&#x27;t figure out how to send into the same channels I&#x27;m reading from and knowing when to close the actual channels. Will work on that next!<p>If you want to check out the project, it&#x27;s located here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Esc4iCEscEsc&#x2F;skanuvaty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Esc4iCEscEsc&#x2F;skanuvaty</a><p>I&#x27;d love your feedback on the code, idea or anything in general! Usually people here have very good feedback, so I&#x27;m excited to hear what you think.<p>Thank you!",
