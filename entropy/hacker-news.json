      "text": "Hello!<p>In the last few months I&#x27;ve worked on creating Codedraft, a mobile application that allows you to learn CSS. It is currently available on Android only:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.codedraft<p>The main idea of the app is to learn and practice at your own speed, that&#x27;s why the information is split into very small pieces. It offers two courses, CSS Basics and Advanced CSS, each of them being split into several sections.<p>Another feature of Codedraft is the ability to practice what you learn in the web app, available at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.codedraft.io. When learning in the mobile app, occasionally you have the option to scan a QR code on the web app - this action will automatically take you to a relevant coding exercise.<p>The web app can also be opened from the &quot;Scan Code&quot; tab in the mobile app.<p>I&#x27;ve always wanted to work on an educational software, however this is my first dive into the domain. :) I would be very happy to get any type of feedback possible.<p>Let me know if you have any questions and thanks a lot for reading!",
