      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I have to do a university assignment that is about software engineering. Unfortunately, designing user-interfaces (in the UX sense) is not a concern, even though we all have to write a user interfaces.<p>For my assignment, one component will have to register the minimum, maximum and most likely cost of building a car. These are just estimates that an engineer will do.\nThe most naive way of doing so would be to put three textboxes that allow the engineer to input whatever he wants. However, only numbers are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer knows that a car has to cost at least x, and they are not willing to pay more than y.\nThat could all be done with textboxes, placeholders, validators that show error messages and so on.\nBut I think a possibly better way would be to have some kind of slider with 3 &quot;blobs&quot; on it that represent min, max and most likely.\nThe advantages would be that the engineer cannot even select values that are out of bound and having the 3 knobs on the line might even visually represent some skewness to his estimation.<p>I then went on Google to see if there is any research to &quot;Designing Components&quot; but I&#x27;m kinda overwhelmed by &quot;top 10 UI&#x2F;UX component&quot; answers and MATERIAL.<p>So I was wondering, how is your process on designing components?",
