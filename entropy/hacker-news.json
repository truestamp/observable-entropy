      "text": "Hi everyone, I&#x27;m building your standard CRUD app as a toy project to explore some fields I&#x27;m interested in.<p>My goal is to make the app local-first with the option to synchronize to a central server and other devices. The data should also be E2E encrypted, meaning that users should input their passwords in order to decrypt the data downloaded from the server.<p>What I&#x27;m asking in this question are resources on how to learn anything relevant to the problem at hand. Good resources on CRDTs, distributed systems, etc., you name it.<p>I&#x27;m also not looking for finished products themselves (e.g. Couchbase or CouchDB), as my goal is to learn this stuff and implement myself a sync engine specific to my app. However I&#x27;d love to read resources about the implementation behind these products.<p>Thanks!",
