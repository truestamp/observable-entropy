I’ve used:<p>- forums<p>- Blogger&#x2F;Wordpress<p>- personal portfolio sites<p>- YouTube for tutorial videos<p>- FB&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;Tumblr<p>- Gumroad for digital products<p>None of these outlets feels like a good “home” to me. Forums were great for WIP feedback but the good ones all died and got hacked. Blogs and my personal sites have always been good, but discoverability isn’t there. Social media platforms gave me a little more visibility, but lock-in and platform culture are extremely toxic. Instagram, for example, is touted as THE social media platform for artists, but the way they process image uploads is awful. The promotion or burying of posts is opaque.<p>I want to create my work and put it where people might have a chance of seeing it, without algorithmic shenanigans or dark patterns.<p>Why is this so difficult? How would you approach solving this?",
