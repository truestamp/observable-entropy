      "text": "I&#x27;ve been playing with cross platform windows&#x2F;linux Kubernetes clusters recently and have had endless problems with installer scripts misconfiguring networking by using the wrong NIC etc.<p>I got frustrated with the tooling on windows to debug container networking so I built a tool that attempts to stitch together the HNS (Host Network Service) &amp; HCS (Host Compute Service) resources into a tree that shows the relationship between configs. You can also search over it to find the networking impacting your containers or launch the windows built in packet capture tool to create a network trace you can open in Wireshark for analysis.<p>I&#x27;m not a desktop app developer so it&#x27;s pretty rough around the edges and I&#x27;ve only really tested on Windows 11 and Server 2019.",
