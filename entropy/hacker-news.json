      "text": "Every year I try to find a good, cross-platform mind mapping app that runs on as many platforms as possible, does not rely on an online or subscription service, and is not prohibitively expensive, but I end up going through the same options: MindNode (which I use and love but doesn’t have a Windows version, let alone Linux), Freemind (which looks and works pretty badly on modern systems), and all sorts of other things (Mindmeister, Xmind, etc.) which have either gone fully online or all out on expensive subscriptions.<p>What (if anything) are people using for mind maps? Is there anything decent (maybe even OpenSource) that will run fully offline as a PWA (like draw.io) and not in a browser?<p>I’ve joked that I’m desperate enough to run an Electron app at this point, as long as I can use it across Windows, Linux and Mac…",
