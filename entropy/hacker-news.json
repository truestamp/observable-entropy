      "text": "As has been discussed ad nauseam here and on other forums, nowadays if you want a well-paying FAANG SWE job, or equivalent, or even a tier down, it is usually necessary to grind Leetcode and the like.<p>Has anyone paid for resume help, or mock interviews or the like?  I know someone who got a Leetcode subscription and then got a good offer after interviewing.<p>I have worked in IT a while (in the US), and have programmed for a few years, and am paid well, but I know people who have jumped to $200k+ TC - a lot of them (and a lot of people here) said it took a few weeks or months of prep.  Since I could boost my TC by tens of thousands of dollars each year, it would be worth hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars for me to get professionally prepped for interviews at FAANG or the equivalent.<p>I bought Cracking the Coding Interview, and am on the Leetcode free tier.  I am wondering what people&#x27;s experience with paid resume and interview preparation services are.  Free services and resources I am interested in hearing about, but I never hear much in way of reviews of paid resume&#x2F;interview services to help people land $200k+ SWE jobs in FAANG or equivalent (or a tier below them).  I&#x27;m wondering if people used them, and what their experiences are.  A lot of them have pitches like &quot;We have lots of ex-Google recruiters on staff!&quot;<p>Of course there might be a ridiculous aspect to all of this, but I prepped for the SAT, and even paid for SAT prep books and courses, so why not this?",
