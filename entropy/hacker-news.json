Note that other exchanges do not require this.<p>This was not accordingly to the Terms I agreed upon when signed up with Coinbase. I felt cheated! The whole mission of Coinbase was to make the world smaller because of anonymous and unregulated ways the cryptocurrencies thrive. Now moving forward when Brian (the owner, who changed his mission many times from charging zero fees to charging over 5% per transaction) is requiring all this info or I lose my money.<p>This is scam and clear case of providing dishonest services.",
