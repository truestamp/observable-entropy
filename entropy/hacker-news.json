People like me who can&#x27;t draw or compose music are in your debt.<p>The game, &quot;Glitch and Rush&quot; has been made in a few hours here and there.<p>I&#x27;ve been tinkering in GameDev for years, if not decades, but I never released anything. The goal here was simple:<p><pre><code>  - come up with a core mechanic\n  - implement a single level\n  - add some polishing\n  - RELEASE\n</code></pre>\nI hope you&#x27;ll enjoy it. BTW, my best time is 2min23s (yes, I&#x27;m bad at my own game, it&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m ok).",
