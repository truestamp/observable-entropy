As I was&#x2F;am traveling at present, I used VPN in a few places, and I tested the theory of this being the source: created a new account yesterday, used it fine with no posting or submissions, then used it again today with two different VPN exit points, and sure enough: &quot;Your account has been permanently suspended from Reddit.&quot;<p>If the Redit bozos do not comprehend the need for VPN, if *content* provided is of not harmful in any way, then I sure wish them good luck in keeping this service going ...",

Things which should be instant takes seconds not even mentioning all other problems it has.\nIts so slow it made me curious why? Lately I have been interested in software performance and I would like to understand omnisharp architecture and decisions they made because there must be some valuable lessons there obviously it was not written to be slow but ended up to be.\nFor now I have very limited understanding of how it works so maybe there is somebody with better understanding of its architecture who could give me some tips or bits of knowledge.",
