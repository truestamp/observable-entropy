      "text": "We&#x27;re building a time-tracking and billing automation product for the legal market, but we&#x27;ve heard from several of our freelance contractors that it would be useful for them too.<p>The tool connects to Word, GDocs, Outlook, Gmail, Chrome etc. and tracks time that you spent for every project, without requiring you to start&#x2F;stop timers - you can assign a document&#x2F;email&#x2F;research session to a client and a project with one click.<p>In the end, you can generate personalized invoices directly from the app, where you can also introduce a Stripe&#x2F;PayPal link to get paid faster.<p>The goal is to help freelancers to get paid in full, because they can actually prove how much they worked, and on what projects.<p>Any feedback would be appreciated! Thanks!",
