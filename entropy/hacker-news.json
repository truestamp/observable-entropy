So what should we do???\nNot to worry! Beast helps you build your projects with minimal effort and high efficiency, bringing more power to you. In addition, it is super easy to use and syntactically easy to understand, making it suitable for both: beginners and highly experienced programmers.\nWith its new release: Nimble (v1.1.0), Beast has become much faster and stronger than before. Its build times are now overtaking or matching those of current community standards!!!<p>In contrast to other such build systems, Beast focusses on both: ease of usability and speed!!!",

      "text": "There&#x27;s so many state management patterns out there and lots of opinions. If you want to learn and conquer Flutter state management then have a look at this book:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jykdesigns.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;ogyzu<p>It looks at the ins and outs of what you get internal to Flutter but then delves into some more complex patterns and ways to structure your code so that it makes sense.<p>Starting with simple setState, it then shows you different ways of passing state across your app to embedding state in your path. Later topics use MVVM patterns with GetIt and MobX.\nThere&#x27;s also an advanced topic on using streams to listen for updates from timers or even external events from Firestore.<p>A good start for someone with a little bit of Flutter but struggling with messy state management.<p>Over 90+ pages and code examples building each example from the last.",
