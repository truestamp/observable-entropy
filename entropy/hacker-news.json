He has misplaced the password. Bitlocker has activated and he now cannot access the Bitlocker key located in his Microsoft account.   He has tried several times to reset the password but they do not allow the reset. He has attempted the reset several times. Is there any way to speak to a person at Microsoft to assist with gaining access to the Microsoft account.",
