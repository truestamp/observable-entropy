      "text": "Just wondering why does companies frown upon demand 220 in Delaware c corp law (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delcode.delaware.gov&#x2F;title8&#x2F;c001&#x2F;sc07&#x2F;)<p>All of their VC&#x27;s and LLP have this information handy for them to mark the market on their investments. Why doesn&#x27;t companies offer this information to other stockholders automatically?<p>One reason I think is they inflate their perspective value to job candidates which will go bust if it doesn&#x27;t match with their reality.<p>An example is I was offered job at Uber and CTO was trying to convince me why they were 400 Billion company when they were last valued at 40 Billion.<p>But I feel like perspective job candidates are cheated out of this information and this is effect on making rich people even richer.<p>I am wondering<p>- If company can opt out of this demand?\n- Is there anything else company can do here.<p>btw other thing that happen because of this is when bitcoin last went down private equity firms scopped up lot of Coinbase stock at $1 billion valuation, because they had insider information that Coinbase transaction volumes were actually going up. Ex employees are cheated out of stock gains because of information asymmetry.<p>I have never done this in practice and but I want to figure is this because this is just accepted wisdom or there is really something holding this back.",
