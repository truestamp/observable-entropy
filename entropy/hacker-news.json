      "text": "Hi, founders!<p>We’ve actually launched quite some time ago, but (semi)pivoted a few times along the way.<p>Jet Admin is an app builder for creating internal tools, admin panels, dashboards, external portals, and so on without coding. You can connect to any backend, assemble a UI through the visual builder, and set up data binding, transformations, conditionals, etc. through the point-and-click interface.<p>If you need to, you can create custom HTTP, SQL queries, make data transformations with JS, and embed custom UI components.<p>We believe that product, data, operations teams should be able to build the very tools they use. And with HN being mostly the coder community, it’d be particularly interesting to hear your feedback&#x2F;thoughts!",
