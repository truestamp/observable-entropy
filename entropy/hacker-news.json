      "text": "I&#x27;ve recently noticed increasing notifications (both via email &amp; 2FA) of attempts to break into various accounts (extant and not). I&#x27;ve enabled 2FA wherever it&#x27;s available and every password is unique via LastPass, but all the notifications I&#x27;ve been getting have me alarmed. For example:<p>&quot;We received a request to reset your password on BestBuy.com. However, we don&#x27;t have an account associated with this email address...&quot;<p>This, combined with the uptick of spam getting through gmail&#x27;s filters, has me considering the daunting task of migrating all of my accounts from me@myname.com to... something else.<p>I&#x27;m curious about the experiences &amp; lessons learned from others here who may have gone through something similar. My current plan is to migrate to accounts+bestbuy@myname.com, accounts+amazon@myname.com, etc, and to isolate human-to-human correspondence at somethingelse@myname.com. But I&#x27;m open to alternative strategies.",
