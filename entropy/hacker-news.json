      "text": "This is going to be a very cynical post. If you just want to sneer at me, please just save us both some time and skip it.<p>My current position has left me questioning much of what I thought about my career, tech industry, and business.<p>The philosophy here boils down to:<p>&quot;We need to move extremely fast.<p>Why? Because there&#x27;s no moat, and competitors will eat us alive, eventually.<p>Therefore, we have to build the crappiest thing we can as fast as possible and make enumerable business promises that we don&#x27;t have the human capacity to keep.<p>Therefore, the only people who will survive at this company will be those who don&#x27;t really care that what they&#x27;re building is setting up the next person for a world of pain.<p>Everyone who wants to do a truly good job will burn out and&#x2F;or be pushed out.<p>But we&#x27;ll keep attracting starry-eyed talent by puffing ourselves up as this incredible, smart organization (that, for now, is making money).&quot;<p>The thing is, I chose this situation based on what I thought a successful company looks like. Now, I want to work somewhere:<p>1) That has slack built in.\n2) That gives a damn about system quality.\n3) That can grow without overreaching (see point 1).<p>Does this type of company even exist? I feel like even if it does, I&#x27;m blind to it because my head has been in this &quot;uber-lean startup&quot; space and I almost can&#x27;t believe anything else exists.<p>It seems like, if something isn&#x27;t trying to grow at breakneck speed, it is stagnating or dying.<p>I want to believe this isn&#x27;t the case.<p>Have you found a place in this world that grows sustainably? If so, how, and do you think I can replicate the search strategy?<p>Thanks.",
