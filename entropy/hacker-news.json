      "text": "Hi all, i wanted to ask the hive mind about subject of taking some extended time off.<p>I’m relatively early in my career, but have been fortunate financially since i started. I have the ability to pay expenses for a year, or longer.<p>My question is essentially: is it career suicide to take 3-6 months or more off of “official” work?<p>With the covid pandemic the past two years, and with work on top I’m feeling the burn-out. I think it would be better for me, and better for my work, if i took some time off.<p>This would probably involve separating with my current employer, and finding a new position at the end of the sabbatical. I would also keep my skills sharp, programming &amp; collaborating with friends.",
