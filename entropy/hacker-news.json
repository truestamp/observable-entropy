      "text": "Posting here in case someone else is going through the same thing and could benefit from reading the comments.<p>I get passionate about a new language, framework, idea, project, or hobby for 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;3 months, then quit. Like clockwork.<p>For some concrete examples, I&#x27;m talking about things like: journaling, Arduino, web development, game dev, photography, writing fiction, tweeting, posting videos to YouTube, knowledge management, &#x27;note-taking,&#x27; and more.<p>I used to think it was a question of burning out, so after a time I  started limiting myself to &#x27;x&#x27; hours a day. That did extend things slightly, but it wasn&#x27;t a game changer.<p>I always seem to find an excuse as to why it&#x27;s not worth continuing right before actually accomplishing anything with the tool&#x2F;skill in question. This applies to things both big, like getting into a whole new hobby, and small like trying some framework out.<p>As such, I spend many days feeling like the donkey in front of the stack of hay and the pail of water. I know that if I only stuck to one thing I would be much better off, but somehow, I don&#x27;t.<p>This translates to my work as well, (at a startup) where my title is, quite literally, &quot;generalist.&quot; I do stuff ranging from the software side all the way to marketing, sales, and everything in between. It&#x27;s working for now but I get the feeling it&#x27;s not viable for the long run.<p>I was wondering what the HN crowd thought about this, and if there is someone who managed to escape this trap. Thank you.",
