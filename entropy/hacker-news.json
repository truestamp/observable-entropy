The discussion in the comment section is often more valuable than the linked article and the text-only page made it read like a real discussion.<p>However, the links to &quot;root&quot;, &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;next&quot; were added recently, which breaks this flow and adds a lot of repeated text that makes it hard to follow the discussion.<p>Has anyone noticed this and is there a chance we might get an option to turn these off?<p>Thanks.",
