But my question is, do you recommend them in general? Or is there any specific course&#x2F;resource that you found particularly good compared to others?",

      "text": "I have to ask - is customer support over with in 2022?<p>Again and again on here we see poor souls who end up in support hellholes, death-spirals and dead-ends. AI chatbots that never let you speak to a human.<p>The only possible way to get real support in 2022 is to have an enormous &quot;megaphone&quot;. If you&#x27;re an influencer you&#x27;re able to make a big stink and have someone important at the company pop up and solve your issue within minutes.<p>And even then you&#x27;re often still stuck. HN got this guy&#x27;s Amazon issue escalated, but the higher-ranking person was still stuck in drone script mode and ultimately proved useless:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigmessowires.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;25&#x2F;amazon-pay-part-2-2300-lost-and-found&#x2F;<p>I just had my bank account closed because I bought something online and it turned out the company was a fraud (my bad research). I asked the bank for a chargeback and they refused. I looked up a couple of management employees contact details and texted them, and they seemed supportive at first, but then they closed my account for contacting their staff outside the online support channel.<p>I think from now 2022 onwards, anything financial you do online must be dealt with an attitude that you might just lose everything and never get a resolution.<p>Am I wrong?",
