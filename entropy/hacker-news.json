      "text": "TL; DR: Put your python code and get an easy-to-use webapp to run it (beta version).<p>Dear all!<p>First time posting on HN. We are excited to show our project here.<p>When you do consult services, often, the customers need a GUI to evaluate your algorithms. We have developed an in-house solution for this, and now we want to make it public. We call it ScienceDesk Algorithm Delivery… until someone suggests a better name :)<p>In this platform, python programmers upload their algorithms and trained models, and generate a sharable URL to run the algorithm. The programmer decides if the source code should be shared or not.<p>As an example, we copied these famous open-source algorithms from GitHub and generated a URL link to run:<p>Deoldfiy – Colorize old black-white photos:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.sciencedesk.net&#x2F;#&#x2F;links&#x2F;21&#x2F;df34a592b89241a38701cfba112007eb&#x2F;<p>Covid Net – X-ray thorax image diagnosis:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.sciencedesk.net&#x2F;#&#x2F;links&#x2F;22&#x2F;bd4d9868d4d3462d942119e5b7fb748f&#x2F;<p>Image AI – Find and count objects in images (we uploaded the yolo-tiny.h5, feel free to add the yolo.h5 model for better results):\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.sciencedesk.net&#x2F;#&#x2F;links&#x2F;20&#x2F;f1b94abcb7924303958a7cd137e19bcc&#x2F;<p>Cartoonifyme -  Quick and dirty opencv algorithm to cartoonize profile pictures\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.sciencedesk.net&#x2F;#&#x2F;links&#x2F;25&#x2F;c9ad75e9491c42319c6bd73294aaf831&#x2F;<p>The customers (or users) will open the URL link and find a simple GUI to run the algorithm: they can upload files, fill input forms, save data structures and download or visualize outputs.<p>HOW-TO<p>Video that explains how to put a hello-word code in ScienceDesk: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;LJ_Wwd58utg<p>TECHNICAL DETAILS:<p>Under the hood, the ScienceDesk backend sends the code and inputs to our orchestrator, the MicroProcServer. The MicroProcServer runs the algorithms in a Kubernetes cluster. Each container that runs the algorithm is completely isolated to protect the user input&#x2F;output data. The MicroProcServer also works as a broker, delivering file inputs to the containers and returning file outputs to the backend. After finishing the session, the user data are erased.<p>All thoughts and feedback are welcome in the comments below, especially if you are a machine learning engineer. \nYou are using a small server, you may need some patience to run something heavy.<p>Thank you so much,\nCarlos",
