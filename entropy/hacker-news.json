Looking for advice from anyone who has experience hiring candidates:<p>---------<p>1. If optimizing for getting in the door at entry-level jobs, what should I prioritize learning and getting Github projects up for?<p>Have been thinking:<p>- React&#x2F;Typescript\n- NodeJS\n- 1 back-end framework (RoR or Django)<p>2. Alternatively, if I already have years of data analyst-level SQL experience, would that give me more leg up in landing an entry-level data engineering vs. a web dev role?<p>And is this a decision I should make upfront to better focus what I Iearn&#x2F;prep?<p>Feel like data eng would mean more emphasis on Python, scripting, Github projects with big data sets and ETL. Feels like a different prep path.<p>Any advice is much appreciated. You all are great and I&#x27;ve learned much from lurking on HN!",

Seems like it has been developed more than upon first appearance - debugger, custom opengl graphics library, and drivers with a shader compiler.<p>For now, he has written the USB driver and SD card reader in C, but he plans on moving it all to Lisp. I love the shader compiler example, and the minimal look.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=I_4Fb7mOtDc",
