I&#x27;ve been a web developer or software engineer for a decade but increasingly painful failures have ruined me as a person and I am lost and without purpose in life. I think I just need to give up on software, I no longer feel welcome or wanted.<p>I have read that burnout can take up to five years to be resolved, I&#x27;m about in year three at this point. It&#x27;s kinda like a recession you can&#x27;t see it coming but looking back its easier to see when it started and its root causes.<p>Even with resources (supportive wife, limited family, therapist) recovery is slow, difficult, confusing and not a straight path. I need a job and purpose before life can improve and I can find a daily existence that&#x27;s not 90% stress. Until then every day is a catastrophe where I&#x27;m upset that I didn&#x27;t solve &quot;the problem&quot; and all I can think about is fixing &quot;everything&quot; or I&#x27;ll lose my wife, my house, my independence, my dignity...<p>If you are suffering from burnout I wish you luck in the eternal struggle for normalcy. I can&#x27;t say it ever gets better, but try to be kind to yourself. Most of all be honest with yourself even if you can&#x27;t be with others.<p>If this post in any way resonates with you feel free to respond or just yell into the void.",
