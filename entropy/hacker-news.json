I write a newsletter on humans and intentionality, and am interested in speaking with or hearing on here from people who either spend a lot of time on Usenet or using IRC, or who take strong anti-web positions and so chose to circumvent the web and instead engage with other Internet protocols like Usenet and IRC.<p>While I&#x27;ve got a broad interest in the subject (interested in hearing whatever you&#x27;d like to share), I am especially interested in hearing from people who prefer Usenet&#x2F;IRC to newer, web-based social platforms (Discord, Slack, etc). Especially if you have taken a strong stance either way.<p>- What keeps you off the web and in non-web spaces?\n- What specifically about Use&#x2F;IRC do you like?",
