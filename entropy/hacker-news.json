      "text": "Hello everyone<p>I am Andy from England. Working with a dev shop where we have been using https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adonisjs.com for a couple of years, I would like to share it with you.<p>AdonisJS (as the website says) is a fully-featured Web framework for Node. The fully-featured keyword is important here because that is the focus of the framework.<p>The framework ships with first-class support for features that 80% of web apps (other than static sites) need. It includes<p>- First-class support for TypeScript.<p>- A fully functional HTTP server with everything you expect like a Router, controllers, support for cookies, sessions, middleware, and so on.<p>- A SQL ORM heavily inspired by Laravel Eloquent and works great. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.adonisjs.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;models&#x2F;introduction<p>- A type-safe validator. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.adonisjs.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;validator&#x2F;introduction<p>- Baked in Auth module using Adapter pattern. They have different guards to log in users with sessions or API tokens.<p>- Social auth package. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.adonisjs.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;auth&#x2F;social<p>- And literally, there are many packages to simplify everyday tasks like file uploads, password hashing, data encryption, and so on.<p>If you or your team are trying to get out of the decision fatigue and embrace a batteries-included framework. Then I highly recommend using AdonisJS.<p>## Resources to get started<p>- AdonisJS crash course - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bSvw887ptKI<p>- Let&#x27;s learn AdonisJS - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jagr.co&#x2F;series&#x2F;lets-learn-adonis-5<p>- A demo polls app - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polls.adonisjs.dev&#x2F; with source code https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adonisjs-community&#x2F;polls-app<p>- Official docs - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.adonisjs.com&#x2F;guides&#x2F;introduction<p>## Why am I cheering for it?<p>As I mentioned, we have been using the framework for a couple of years and love it. However, the framework is not very popular, and hence at times, we have a hard time selling it to our clients.<p>So, the management decided that we should do our part in supporting the framework. I am also talking to the community members to see if we can do a small remote meetup.<p>## Meh, I don&#x27;t like it, or I don&#x27;t like batteries-included frameworks<p>That is okay. We all have personal preferences and tastes when it comes to writing code. My only intention is to share it with folks who like batteries-included frameworks and then grow the community around like-minded people :)",
