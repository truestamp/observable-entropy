      "text": "A couple of days ago I got the following mail:<p><i>Hello,<p>We’re sending this communication regarding backup and policy updates to CrashPlan for Small Business.<p>Starting October 20, 2021, we will release a series of automatic updates to implement the following changes on all devices:<p><pre><code>  - Minimum backup frequency and version retention settings of 30 minutes\n  - Deleted files retention limited to 90 days\n  - Additional file exclusions\n</code></pre>\nWe are making these changes as part of our continued commitment to safeguarding backup integrity while keeping our service price competitive. These changes are mandatory and it is not possible to opt out. If you’ve deleted files from your computer that you would like to retain, you’ll need to restore them before October 20.</i><p>So far I was able to keep my deleted files in my backups forever, which for instance allowed me to restore a Bitcoin wallet.dat from 2013. Naturally I&#x27;d like to keep this setting and not have my backups retroactively purged.<p>Therefore I now want to start looking for an alternative solution with following features:<p><pre><code>  - multiple destinations possible (e.g. Dropbox, SFTP, Hard drive)\n  - encryption of files before they are uploaded\n  - incremental backups\n  - file versioning\n  - point-in-time recovery of files (to avoid ransomware issues)\n  - retention of deleted files possible\n</code></pre>\nSo far I&#x27;ve been recommended https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arqbackup.com&#x2F;index.html which looks like it ticks most boxes.<p>What other solutions and approaches for macOS can you recommend?",
