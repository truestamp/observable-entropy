      "text": "I&#x27;m trying to find a good language to be able to document relationships between tables. For example, some thing that declares that a `users` table can be joined to a `customers` table on `users.customer_id = customers.id`.<p>Examples of this that I know of<p>- ORMs define these relationships<p>- LookML as a proprietary format<p>- Foreign Keys can kind of do this, but enforce a restriction, rather than just being declarative.<p>Ideally this format can be serialized&#x2F;deserialized to help inform possible queries that can be run, and is agnostic from an ORM&#x2F;specific data stack.<p>It&#x27;s always surprised me the SQL spec itself doesn&#x27;t have a mechanism for declaring this information about the relationship between tables, other than strict fkeys.",

      "text": "Time for my biweekly weekend project to get my startup juices flowing. The idea is simple (and somewhat naïve).<p>There was this senate confirmation hearing where the interviewee (a Democrat nominee) said, &quot;We all harbor inherent racial biases.&quot; So I thought what would be the most &quot;The Voice&quot;esque way to hire people where you put aside every discriminatory prejudice you have and do at least the audio screening interview based on merit alone. And here are.<p>The plan is to -<p>- Use TTS to transcribe audio to text<p>- Remove high frequency common phrasing that can be associated with a particular group<p>- Read back the text with a computer voice.<p>Seems like a super naïve idea that is novel and unsellable. For screening interviews over phone call or audio chat atleast this idea kinda feels appropriate. But food for thought right :)<p>PS: let me know if these kind of posts are bad for HN. I have read the FAQs and Guideline page multiple times for this. I think it falls fairly into the category of &quot;anything that gratifies one&#x27;s intellectual curiosity.&quot;",
