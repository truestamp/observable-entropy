      "text": "I&#x27;m in my late 20s, just started my career proper as a developer. I got into a big tech position, leaving behind startups and the chaos of my early 20s, for now.<p>When I started school at 18, I was full of excitement and big ideas. Over time, economic, social, and physiological realities have sunk in: big ideas are hard and take a LOT of time to realize. Happiness is found in relationships. People (myself included) are very limited and imperfect. The body requires a lot of maintenance and has limited energy. Money is really nice.<p>A mentor has advised me not to become &quot;boring&quot; and wants me to try to stay entrepreneurial. I still want to be creative. But I wonder if I&#x27;ll do these things or if I will just work and be happy.<p>I don&#x27;t have a specific question here, just want to get perspectives and experiences. It seems like this forum is full of people who have traveled a similar path: starting with big ideas and hopes for their future, sometimes being able to achieve those but through a tremendous amount of time and effort. Or, have realized that a certain amount of money, free time and family is all they really need.<p>What are your thoughts?",
