      "text": "I was filling out a rental application on on-site.com and a modal popped up telling me I had been texted a link and had 5 minutes to resend the link. I got a text from 32858 and it was of the form https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.equifax.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;secure-mfa&#x2F;v2&#x2F;authentications&#x2F;verification-tokens&#x2F;&lt;long hexstring&gt;&#x2F;verify. I clicked on it and it took me to a page that just had the text, &quot;Authentication completed. Return to your application,&quot; or something like that. I don&#x27;t remember what the domain was.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find anything online about this, so I&#x27;m wondering, is this legit? Or is this somehow an elaborate ploy to steal my identity? What&#x27;s also weird is that the website didn&#x27;t change after I clicked on the link, but at some point I saw a back button on the page which closed the modal, and now I&#x27;m wondering if that button was there the whole time. Also, if I tap on the link again, I get redirected to secureauth.io&#x2F;expired, but I can find no information about that domain online. My co-applicant never had the modal pop up and never got a text.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been programming for 6 years and I feel I&#x27;m in a loop and not making a progress.<p>Basically I want to know is how to become better.<p>Few questions for you:<p>- how do you learn new codebase?<p>- do you ever stop struggling?<p>- what helped you become productive?<p>- are you 10x? do you know how to become 3x?<p>To me it feels no matter how much time passes I keep on struggling. Every ticket is a start of new torture. I learned design patterns but it didn&#x27;t really help. I have read lot of code and written lot of code, but against code bases that are like 8 years old there is really no way to &quot;get it&quot;. There is just too much inconsistent abstractions going on. Too much complexity everywhere.<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself stupid, but I just feel hopeless, like you would if you were a climate scientist and seeing world just produce more and more greenhouse gases despite all you said and did. Trying to stop unstoppable force.<p>I change jobs every 1-2 years and most of my career as a result has been in noob stage of learning new tools, codebase, framework, industry, etc. It takes like 1 year to even feel productive. So this is probably the big thing. But at few jobs things never got easier so had to leave, there it was politics, scrum.<p>Speaking of scrum&#x2F;agile&#x2F;points&#x2F;crap&#x2F;etc... wtf. How to take something vague, force you to give an estimate over 2 line description and then cry when it&#x27;s wrong. I feel any team or company that uses scrum is masking for its incompetent management.",
