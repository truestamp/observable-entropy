      "text": "When I search a word or phrase in Google Chrome&#x27;s default Bookmarks Manager, I get a bunch of search results, but no indication in the same UI (e.g. via breadcrumbs) of the folder path hierarchical structure that each returned result may be nested inside.<p>(To get some inkling of what folder a returned result is in: I need to select a returned result, right-click, and then choose &quot;Show in Folder&quot;... this is a very slow and tedious process.)<p>The folder path hierarchical structure is very important to me because it&#x27;s meta data that indicates the relevance of each returned result.<p>The closest thing that does this that I&#x27;ve found so far is a Chrome Extension called &quot;TabIt - BookMarks: Productivity in Access&quot;. I found it after a long search of Extensions on the Chrome Web Store, using a bunch of potentially relevant keywords, etc. I didn&#x27;t find anything else (there were two others that were almost useful, but they used &quot;fuzzy search&quot; that returned irrelevant results).<p>If you&#x27;ve found anything else that indicates each returned result&#x27;s location in the folder hierarchy (e.g. via breadcrumbs) after doing a bookmarks search, please share. Thanks.",
