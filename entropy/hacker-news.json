      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working at a FAANG company (call it FaceAppleMicroNetoogle) for several years. I make &gt; $800,000 a year. I live in the bay area and spend a lot of what I make (after taxes and 401k) on housing and other basic needs for my wife and two kids.<p>I have a certain amount of ennui lately. My team at FaceAppleMicroNetoogle is maybe growing in a different direction than I am. With respect to software engineering practices in my particular vertical. I&#x27;m working on something that I don&#x27;t think will matter. But it has to be done anyway to meet some goals. I can and will do that thing.<p>I feel a certain amount of job security at FaceAppleMicroNetoogle. I can probably continue to contribute there. At a high level for the foreseeable future. And I think it&#x27;s unlikely that I&#x27;ll be fired or laid off any time soon. I said the thing I&#x27;m working on won&#x27;t make an impact. But that probably won&#x27;t significantly count against me. I&#x27;ve told several levels of managers that it won&#x27;t make an impact, for what that&#x27;s worth. But it still has to happen and so I&#x27;ll finish it. Once that&#x27;s done, the next thing I work on might make an impact...but even if it does, I&#x27;m not sure that would move the needle for me as far as job satisfaction.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about leaving Silicon Valley. Going somewhere cheaper. But how can someone give up an earning opportunity like this? On the one hand I feel kind of prisoner to it. And on the other hand I feel incredibly ungrateful and entitled to be even considering giving up a paycheck that&#x27;s 10x what a lot of people would be grateful for.<p>I think to some degree the crazy pay and the crazy costs are a treadmill. I guess my question is, if anyone else has gotten off that treadmill. And if so, how has it affected your life?",
