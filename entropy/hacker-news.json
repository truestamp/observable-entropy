      "text": " I&#x27;m interested in starting website similar to Mark Cuban&#x27;s Cost Plus Drugs. From what I&#x27;ve gather, his website sells drugs with a 15% markup and shipping. The actual drugs are white labeled and shipped by True Pill. His site mainly does the marketing and maintains the customer relationship.\nI want to launch a similar venture but sell the drugs at cost (no mark up). This would be a non-profit with the goal of helping people reduce their drug cost. I applied to True Pill to get access to their API but I don&#x27;t get any response from them. I&#x27;ve tried calling their 800 number but it tells me to send an email to their sales&#x2F;support email address. Does True Pill only work with large, established players? Does anybody work for True Pill that can help?",
