      "text": "At my work I get a couple of weeks of low intensity work for every 4-6 months when I have about 20 hours&#x2F;week I can spend time on doing side projects or maybe learn something new. In the past I have taken on multiple projects that couldn’t be finished in 2 weeks and when I come back to them 4 months later I would have to basically start from scratch due to lose of flow hence it would be difficult to get motivated. Is there anything useful I can do that may be helpful for the world in these two weeks. I’m not too concerned about putting stuff on my resume. My primary goal is to be useful and secondary is to have fun. While I feel I do have a pretty good knowledge of algos and data structures, being a hardware engineer (RTL, HDL etc) my software skills, especially knowing the latest frameworks are not the strongest for sure.",
