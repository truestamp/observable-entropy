      "text": "Sharing some ideas I had around digital wellbeing in the hope there are already things out there that could do the job.<p>Idea #1<p>-------<p>A browser extension that hides comments on YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and Hacker News.<p>The toggle needs to be convenient so users can &#x27;reveal&#x27; comments on demand.<p>An implementation for apps could be nice but I assume it can&#x27;t be done.<p>There is a chrome extension that does something like this but it&#x27;s not easily toggled and is just limited to YouTube: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;hide-youtube-comments&#x2F;kehdmnjmaakacofbgmjgjapbbibhafoh?hl=en<p>Idea #2<p>-------<p>A browser extension watching user activity (keeping all data local). Can identify &#x27;autopilot patterns&#x27; and lets users set up indicators to let them know when they fall into a pattern.<p>It could also provide digests &#x2F; live metrics with an estimate of time spent in autopilot.<p>It&#x27;s really important things are presented in a super non-judgemental way and are easily toggled; it shouldn&#x27;t be like the anti-distraction apps that can feel imposing rather than a tool the user is free to use however they like.<p>Rationale<p>----------<p>I noticed that over lockdown I would spend a lot of time browsing YouTube on autopilot so, as an experiment, I started using an extension that hides comments.<p>This set-up gave me an instant &quot;you&#x27;re on autopilot&quot; signal because most of the times I switch off, I will scroll down to the comments at some point.<p>Since starting to use the extension, I spend way less time on YouTube but still feel like I&#x27;m getting so much more out of it.<p>I&#x27;m also noticing that a lot of the time autopilot is triggered by some ego resistance, things like &quot;this isn&#x27;t my kind of thing&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t like this person&quot;.<p>When I catch this in the moment, which is happening more often, there&#x27;s an opportunity for me to understand that resistance, let it go and re-engage.<p>It&#x27;s definitely brought some mindfulness to my day and made me more open to things.<p>I&#x27;d be really interested to see how a &#x27;toggleable&#x27; comments &#x2F; autopilot detection set up impacts other people and changes the way they use different sites.",
