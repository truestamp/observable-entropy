Especially now that we have modules supported in the browser, it is lovely!<p>But I don&#x27;t like that all my code is out in the open verbatim.<p>What is a good way to obfuscate it? Preferably some command line tool that I can unleash onto a directory, and it will obfuscate every js file it finds in there, including subdirs.",

Ultimately, whoever is involved will get a massive discount. Also your feedback will quite literally impact the product the way you want.<p>The only requirement is that you should be a paying user of a PaaS provider (Netlify, Heroku, Vercel, etc.) now or have been one in the past (it&#x27;s just about the accuracy of the feedbacks)<p>Please let me know here or DM me on Twitter (MohsenKamranii).",
