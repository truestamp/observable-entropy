      "text": "They don&#x27;t say it out loud, but it&#x27;s obvious that no one at Google uses their own Pixel phones.  I&#x27;m also quite sure no one at Microsoft used Windows Phones, otherwise they would&#x27;ve detected the problems with it and would&#x27;ve addressed them from a typical user&#x27;s standpoint, instead of focusing on fancy engineering stuff (e.g., unifying the Windows Phone 8 kernel with Windows 8).<p>Back to Google: I was enjoying my Pixel 4a up until a month ago, when I made the mistake to upgrade to the nefarious Android 12. Since then, I&#x27;ve had various issues with the phone, from disabled swipe key to apps outright crashing (this never happened before on v11). And don&#x27;t even get me started on the design... Somebody on HN said Android 12 looks like it was made for toddlers, with ridiculously large buttons and &quot;bubbly&quot; UI.<p>Anyway, I thought maybe newer Pixels might be a fresh air, esp. the 6. I am honestly quite impressed by Pixel cameras. My 4a doesn&#x27;t have a top tier camera and yet, the portrait mode looks pretty good, thanks to the AI algorithms. So I thought a Pro model might be even more amazing. But given the recent update that made some newer Pixels not able to make phone calls (!), and given that Google announced they will fix it by late January, I&#x27;m just done with the Android ecosystem.<p>I had high hopes that Android phone manufacturers may have changed their strategy to focus more on the ecosystem, as opposed to offer one-time-purchase products that&#x27;ll end up in waste lands. I really wanted to like my experience with Android, esp. since navigation is way easier on an Android than on iOS. But lack of enthusiasm and responsibility from Google and other OEMs (esp. Samsung) made me decide to switch to iPhone after 8 years. I just can&#x27;t buy toys anymore.",
