      "text": "I&#x27;m considering the development of a simple browser plugin that would reinstate the &quot;dislike&quot; button on youtube videos as far as its informativeness for viewers is concerned: You&#x27;d be able to click (the plugin&#x27;s) dislike button and see the count just like before, but of course that information would not go into YT&#x27;s ranking.<p>This requires some backend functionality, mostly a database that maps URLs to counts (+ plus the server code to make that work). I expect this to be costly. But how much would you estimate for this?",
