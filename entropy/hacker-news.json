Born on  May 6th of the year 2002, Suhail has been a student of Crescent Classes and presently is a Dental Surgery Bachelor (BDS) at GDC Srinagar.\nSuhail has had a childhood affinity towards Sufi ideas and shrines. Relatably, Suhail&#x27;s writings and poetic works revolve around and encompass Sufi notions and culture. Suhail also fans the season of autumn, with the season&#x27;s transformational events finding a metaphorical presence in His works. Suhail, more properly &#x27;Suhail Ahmad Khan&#x27;, uses &#x27;Bazm(بزم)&#x27; as His pen-name(تخلص).",
