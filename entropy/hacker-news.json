      "text": "Hello HN!<p>I&#x27;d like to share a browser extension I made that provides quick offline access to various development tools.<p>Current tool set: Calculate hashes; encode and decode HTML, URI, Base64; convert numbers between different bases; parse and manipulate various time formats; format and inspect IPv4&#x2F;CIDR addresses; search all v13.1 emoji with quick copying in various formats.<p>It runs entirely offline, making no external requests (even emoji PNG files are bundled), and only requires local storage permission to remember your last tab and input.<p>This was inspired by an old extension called Hasher (no longer on the Chrome Store) that provided a simple interface to similar utilities. This was an opportunity to get back into making extensions, practice with Vue a bit, and expand upon the original idea.<p>It&#x27;s available for Chrome, Edge (via Chrome Store), and Firefox; links and screenshots are on GitHub, where you can also report any problems. Feedback and suggestions are very welcome.
