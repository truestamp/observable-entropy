      "text": "Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve started working on an app to help companies, freelancers, and even individual content creators plan, produce, review, and publish their videos and streams in a more organised way. We&#x27;re just getting started so not trying to sell anything at this point, but I do need feedback on where we&#x27;re headed.<p>I recorded a video walkthrough of some mock-ups at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mTtB_EkUA-M, or you can take a look at them yourself at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.synura.com&#x2F;mockups&#x2F; (it is somewhat self-explanatory, but in the video I add more context). You can think of it as a potentially better, more organised alternative to having a bunch of stuff in random Google Docs and other places that you have to pass back and forth. I also eventually expect to add a lot of automatic post-processing type features (captioning, lighting&#x2F;sound adjustments, &quot;umm&quot; removal, etc.) for people who don&#x27;t know how to do that on their own.<p>Any kind of feedback at all is welcome, positive or negative, on whether there&#x27;s an idea here that you think I could develop into something people would pay for, or if there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to see in an app like this. Thanks in advance!",
