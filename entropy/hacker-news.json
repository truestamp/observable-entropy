      "text": "I&#x27;m trying to reduce the services&#x2F;apps I pay for, and one of the easy ones to lose (I think) is my time tracking app. As a freelancer, I have realised I really don&#x27;t need to be putting my time into Harvest, because all I ever enter is what was in my Google Calendar in the first place.<p>So I figure if I can get my calendar data into a database (like Notion) or even just a spreadsheet, i&#x27;m home and hosed. I&#x27;ve found a lot of the automation services like automate.io or Zapier would require me to pay for a subscription to do the amount of automation required to get the job done, and i&#x27;ve also discovered that while there are add ons to Google Calendar and Google Sheets that can carry data across, I haven&#x27;t found them to be reliable in my testing.<p>So - i&#x27;d love tips on the simplest possible way to do this.<p>My setup is - each project has it&#x27;s own calendar under my Google Workspace calendar account. I would then tally up the calendar time blocks on a given calendar when it&#x27;s time to invoice that client. Simple as that. Or it will be - once I figure out a simple and reliable way to do it.<p>Thanks!",
