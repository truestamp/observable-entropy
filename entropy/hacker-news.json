We&#x27;re a young team building a tool to turn OKRs into daily tasks so you can finally make sure your big projects become reality.<p>How do you make sure you progress on big goals on a daily basis? Would love to hear your recos.<p>The approach we&#x27;re taking is that projects happen across tons of app so we&#x27;re building the tool that can spot any task you have across tools, and centralise it all on Kairn to help you prioritise and get things done.<p>Wanna test it?
