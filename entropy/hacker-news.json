      "text": "Hi! I&#x27;m Andrew, and I&#x27;ve been building https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scribble.run. Scribble makes it easy to add a contract signing feature to your SaaS platform. I ran into this problem at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;criya.co. Criyas customers are mostly interior designers, doing projects for clients. An interior designer needed to be able to upload <i>their</i> contract, and collect a signature from the client before engaging in a design project together.<p>Because I’m not a lawyer, I was hoping to be able to buy instead of build. When I looked around for products in this space, the closest I could find were products that let <i>the company</i> upload documents, add signature fields, and embed them in app. Sure, we could&#x27;ve told people they had to use <i>our</i> standard contract, but that would’ve been awkward, and the interior designers would probably have just gone off platform for signatures.<p>There doesn&#x27;t appear to be anything on the market that lets the <i>end user</i> upload documents, mark them up with signature fields, and require other people to sign them, before programmatically doing other things.<p>After some hacking, here is what I came up with: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C1wdKyB8Mdg&amp;t=0s.<p>I&#x27;m packaging this up as a bunch of react hooks &amp; components, so engineering teams can maintain control of the UI, making the integration feel exactly like the rest of your product. I&#x27;m a big fan of companies like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clerk.dev or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typesense.org that give me full stack features with mainly front end integrations.<p>I think we are going to see a big wave of &#x27;embedded SaaS&#x27; products in the coming years. You can send a HMAC Digest[1] to a browser, and use that for authentication with an external service, it&#x27;s cool!<p>I&#x27;ve started onboarding a couple companies, and am trying to talk to as many devs as possible. Would love to hear from the HN community, feel free to &#x27;request access&#x27; on my marketing site (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scribble.run), or drop me a line (andrew at scribble dot run)!",
