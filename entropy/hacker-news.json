      "text": "All Linux machines at work now run &quot;Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection&quot; (mdatp).<p>We have seen software crashing because files that were expected to be there were suddenly moved to &quot;quarantine&quot; by mdatp. On another occasion a job that moves thousands of small files to another directory took hours instead of seconds to complete. The mdatp daemon was running at 100% CPU and scanning all files for &quot;threats&quot;.  The &quot;solution&quot; IT Operations implemented was that they added the affected directories to some ignore-list in the mdatp configuration.<p>Yesterday, a shell script that uses sort just crashed because it was missing &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;sortFhe4A. It turned out that MDATP moved the file while the sort process was running. The file contained alphanumeric identifiers. Some combination in sort&#x27;s tempfiles apparently resembled the signature of some stupid VB-Script malware.\nIn all cases  it was false alarm. Duh..<p>Microsoft Defender renders Linux machines unusable.\nInstead of protecting against threats this piece of junk is outright malware.",
