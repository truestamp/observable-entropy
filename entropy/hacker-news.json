After installing the browser addon you opened up any page and pressed the &quot;scrape configuration&quot; button.<p>Each text and image element on the webpage would get highlighted slightly yellow. When you clicked one it would mark other elements with a tick and cross. This was effectively a filtering process to generate the right CSS selector. You would repeat it for each type of element you wanted to select. Once you completed your types, you uploaded the config to their website, where you could select how often it would scrape the webpage.<p>I distinctly remember an example video being used to scrape the HN homepage.<p>Does anyone else remember this tool? What was the name? Did they sell?",
