      "text": "Say some idea comes to your mind, or you get a requirement to create something(a code function, class, art, product, architecture, design, anything). This is the start of the journey. You experiment, tinker along, try few things, and finally when you are satisfied with what you have created you complete that journey.<p>Now how do you track all the things, related to the creation process, that happened along that journey from start to finish? What tools do you use? During the creation process lots of artefacts are created, some are thrown away, some are changed from their initial state, some are used in the final outcome etc. Mapping this creator&#x27;s journey will help a lot. Are there any tools to capture this journey as the creator goes about the creation process?",
