      "text": "I&#x27;m currently building a Ethereum NFT Rarity Lookup Tool (whoa, I need a shorter way to describe this :D). We are fetching every token in a collection, analyze their metadata and rank them accordingly.<p>You can check it out here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cavar.io&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;ve launched last week and I&#x27;m looking for feedback. So if you have NFTs, thinking of buying or have a general interest in the topic I would love to get your feedback on this.<p>Right now, we don&#x27;t offer much features. But here is what we have so far:<p>Add projects(collections) to our database: Other than most rarity tools, we allow users to add projects to our database. If we don&#x27;t have the collection that interests you in our database already, you can just add it. Depending on the amount of projects currently in queue it might take some time, but you can see the progress on the Projects Overview Page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cavar.io&#x2F;projects<p>Projects Rarity Ranking: You can see all tokens in a project on the Project Detail Page (for example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cavar.io&#x2F;project&#x2F;proof-moonbirds). You see what see the ranking for each token at first glance. If you want to get more information about a specific token, just go to the:<p>Token Detail Page: Here you can see the traits and the respective values of the token (Example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cavar.io&#x2F;project&#x2F;boredapeyachtclub&#x2F;1337&#x2F;129943780)<p>We&#x27;re adding new features on a daily basis. But most importantly: We&#x27;re constantly fixing bugs (because we&#x27;re still in alpha stage). Right now, our tool is FREE to use and we would appreciate any kind of feedback.<p>If you have feedback, please use the Feedback button on our page, leave me a comment here or hit us up on Twitter: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cavarioNFT",
