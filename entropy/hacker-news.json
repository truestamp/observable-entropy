The app does not interact with the game&#x27;s source code in any way - it is entirely separate. I plan to monetize the app.<p>The game&#x27;s EULA forbids any derivative works. I&#x27;ve been googling a lot and it seems that some derivative works are considered &#x27;fair use&#x27; - for example, game-related content from creators on youtube and twitch. Is my app going to be considered &#x27;fair use&#x27; too?<p>Is there any copyright lawyer who could help me understand if my app is going to infringe the game&#x27;s copyright?<p>Thanks in advance!!!",

The idea is to provide tools to assist founders, such as:\n- Business model development\n- Recommendations based on your current business context and your own role in it\n- Add recommendations as tasks<p>There are more features in the works too, such as automated answering of common questions. I also want to add far more recommendations than are currently available.<p>The tech stack is:\n- Flutter (front-end)\n- Nim (back-end)\n- PostgreSQL (DB)<p>The UI is actually written on the back-end in Nim, and rendered by Flutter. I&#x27;m planning to make this tech available as Open Source, and you can join a wait-list if interested: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexusdev.tools&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nexusdev.tools&#x2F;</a><p>Feedback on CxO Industries, but also the tech behind it, is welcome.",
