More RAM and storage also means more data&#x2F;code cached locally.<p>A client-focused future would be about mobile apps, installed web apps, offline&#x2F;local-first, syncing, moving more app logic locally. A server-focused future would be about pushing all logic to the edge with server components&#x2F;SSR and making clients thin.<p>The dilemma is that with increases in speed and capabilities, both seem to get better, but which approach will win out?",
