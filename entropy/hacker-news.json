      "text": "One of my biggest pet peeves&#x2F;downsides of video chat is that they (by necessity) mute all other lines when someone is talking, to prevent feedback. If everyone is wearing headphones rather than listening via speakerphone&#x2F;computer, it&#x27;s not longer necessary to do that.<p>When crosstalk is muted, it removes a huge interpersonal dynamic in natural conversation. If I can convince my team to use e.g. airpods for all video calls, I&#x27;d like to find a video service where we can talk over each other as well.<p>Do you know of any?",

If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one&#x27;s intellectual curiosity.<p>Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they&#x27;re evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they&#x27;d cover it on TV news, it&#x27;s probably off-topic.\n```<p>These guidelines doesn&#x27;t seem relevant anymore.\nPolitical content, of a certain specific type, isn&#x27;t being flagged as inappropriate for the platform.\nAn example from the last day: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30639159<p>Is HN now a political platform serving anger with shallow titles of mass media?\nWhy should there be exception for certain news?<p>Is it that mods specifically want to see certain titles here so they don&#x27;t act on it, or is it a more wide-spread decision and we can expect to see more political subjects here?",
