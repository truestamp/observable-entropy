      "text": "I&#x27;m a first-time founder, and very introverted. After meeting 50 VCs, it comes as no surprise that we weren&#x27;t able to raise money. My startup is post-product, and growing double-digit MoM (not consistently though).<p>I&#x27;ve concluded that in order for first-time founders to get funding, you need at least one of the following:<p>1. You have personal relationships with VCs, 2. Your startup is post product-market fit, i.e. &gt;10% WoW growth, 3. You bootstrap all the way through by charging users early<p>If I was to start over again, I&#x27;d go with option 3. Squatted on zoom calls with VCs trying to pitch your vision, background, and MVP narrative in some exaggerated way isn&#x27;t my cup of tea. I get tense. I shake. I find it appalling to ask for money. But, I know fundraising is a skill every founder must build, no matter how repulsive they find the process to be.<p>Would love thoughts from other startup founders.",
