      "text": "Hey Hacker News,<p>Today we&#x27;re launching Equals. Equals is a spreadsheet with native connections to your SQL databases and data warehouses. You can write SQL right in your spreadsheet.<p>Equals was born out of a shared frustration of me and my co-founder. Despite the avalanche of new data tools over the last decade – nothing actually seemed better than a spreadsheet. Nothing was as flexible, malleable, and as easy to just dive in and play around with some data. In fact, you nearly always ended back in a spreadsheet regardless of what fancy set up you had: when something broke, when a chart in a BI tool didn&#x27;t quite make sense, etc.<p>You can learn more about Equals here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;equals.app&#x2F;<p>We&#x27;d love to hear what you all think.<p>Ben",
