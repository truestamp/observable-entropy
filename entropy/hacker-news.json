And as far as I know, there aren&#x27;t many physical community gatherings happening close to where I live.<p>I would like to change that.<p>So: those of you who have managed to successfully connect with other developers online, how did you do it?<p>If anyone would like to chat or learn together, just send me a message here or email me at: erikpl (at) duck (dot) com. These days, my learning is focused on C (related to a compiler course) and video streaming (work-related).",
