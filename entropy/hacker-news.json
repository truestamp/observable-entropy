      "text": "I was reading an article (1) that touted an awesome finding in topological electronic materials to minimize energy losses in electrical conductors.  They lightly touch on the rationale that led the researchers to a hypothesis that they ultimately [presumably secured funding for then] explored empirically.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought that this represents the tip of the ice burg - the many *funded* scientific hypotheses that don&#x27;t pan-out. To me, these efforts are equally important, and I&#x27;m sure the scientific community agrees. It&#x27;s similar to the efforts (funding&#x2F;time) invested in replicating claimed results.<p>Does anyone know how these &#x27;unsung heros&#x27; (to include both the researchers and benefactors) are showcased in science media? Is this done only through citation of the &#x27;popular&#x27; papers with successful results?<p>1.)
