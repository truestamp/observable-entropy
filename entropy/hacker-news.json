      "text": "I recently changed from using Manjaro with Gnome to using a MacBook Pro M1 for work reasons. I can&#x27;t stand it. I always wondered why mac users are always so untidy (leaving a million windows open and having to spend so long to search for them). I now know it&#x27;s not the people, it is MacOS. The user interface doesn&#x27;t let you organise your windows in a helpful way. Minimise, maximise and close buttons make no sense. Everything is rigged to use the mouse, and even then, it is slow and painful. You cannot even natively tile windows to occupy half of the screen.<p>Does anyone else share the same frustration as I do?",
