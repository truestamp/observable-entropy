One admin did not have a location to report (concerning).<p>Is this a new variation of how international data mining organizations get people in the US to give up their personal social data by signing up with these pages?<p>We know the fallout from the Russian orgs getting data from social media on US adults, but is this a new version post-Facebook&#x27;s crack down on data access?",
