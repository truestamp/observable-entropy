Bonus points if you spot them).<p>In essence, the site gathers references from wikipedia articles and presents them chronologically. A couple of specific examples below:<p>* 2022 Rusiian Invasion of Ukraine: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hindsite.info&#x2F;narrative&#x2F;4271\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hindsite.info&#x2F;narrative&#x2F;4271</a><p>* 2022 South Korean Presidential Election: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hindsite.info&#x2F;narrative&#x2F;3017\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hindsite.info&#x2F;narrative&#x2F;3017</a><p>And the features I&#x27;m particularly happy with:<p>* Filter references by language<p>* Filter references by type (video, forum, article)<p>* Filter reference by source (click on the domain to the right of the link)<p>* Blue bell next to a reference shows it was added today.<p>* Modal to display youtube videos<p>* Modal to display tweets<p>I would love to hear you opinions on this as a general source of information and if you would use it. If so, I&#x27;ve a huge roadmap set out, and I&#x27;ll most likely be able to convince some devs to join me.<p>Parroting my about section:<p>This website was created out of frustration with the current incarnation of news on the internet.<p>On social media today we are supplied with an undifferentiated feed of individual news articles, videos and images from different times in multiple news stories. This causes unecessary rehashing of a story &quot;It&#x27;s already been debunked! Look!&quot; and even the sharing of information that has since been proven to be false.<p>What is being built here is an attempt at aggregating relevant articles of significant events in a chronological fashion. So as to be somewhat of a clear, if not definitive source of aggregated information.<p>We hope to bring many more features to you over time that will help make sense of information on the internet.",
