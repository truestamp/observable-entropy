Ideally spending money would also help nudge things into a good direction and help firefox start becoming more independent of google.<p>I already looked into Mozilla vpn (I don&#x27;t need it), Firefox Enterprise - which is not a thing on linux and the features don&#x27;t help me either.<p>How to you guys support mozilla and firefox?",
