Netflix &#x2F; Disney etc seem to have copped onto one idea that works and just release the same tv show &#x2F; movie over and over again with a slight tweak as it brings the money in without any worries.<p>Am I just now very old or is individuality in art and media now seen as a negative, whilst cookie-cutter straight-down-the-middle appeal-to-the-lowest-common-denominator-guff the only way to get ahead at the moment.",
