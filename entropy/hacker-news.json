      "text": "Hey HN!<p>Recently I came across SubReply[0], a social media site, and its CSS style is really nice. So nice that I decided to rip it and modified it to become a classless CSS style.<p>I spend about a few hours modding the CSS, removing&#x2F;replacing class-based part, fixing bugs, and add additional features, such as custom blockquotes.<p>The style will needs some more work, but basically it has done what it needs to do.<p>I would love hearing your feedbacks and comments on the project!<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subreply.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subreply.com</a>",
