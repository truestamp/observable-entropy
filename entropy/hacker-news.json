      "text": "Hi! this is Dan and Genevieve from Burstable AI, developers of Cloudburst, a Jupterlab-based cloud platform with notebooks, a terminal, and GPU.<p>We&#x27;ve just added support for git-lfs (Large File Storage) to be able to track datasets and models in git without worrying about storage limits.<p>To make this useful, we are hosting Datahub, our own open, public LFS server, free to use for any AI&#x2F;ML-related data. The easiest way to use it is to check out our LFS tutorial on cloudburst (link is on the landing page). Note that Datahub is not tied to Cloudburst: repos created in Cloudburst can be checked out by any git client with LFS installed.<p>LFS has a nasty reputation as being hard to configure and use, but we have tried to make the experience as simple and intuitive as possible. Please let us know how we are doing! We can be contacted at:<p>beta at cloudburst dot host.",
