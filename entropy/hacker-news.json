Front end built in React.js<p>Salary: Budget is over the 100K mark, waiting to hear back from the company on confirmation of that.<p>Client Notes: Really neat business model, and a team of people that actually give a shit about each other and contributing to the product. Definitely would like to work with people interested in music, and are part of other communities and advocacy. If you&#x27;re interested, I suggest checking out the founder&#x27;s posts on Linkedin, to get a sense of the team.<p>Notes: I am a recruiting consultant that is working with the client, I don&#x27;t think this breaks any posting rules but happy to change&#x2F;remove if so! If you apply, please DM so I can let the client know. I&#x27;m not commission-based, and the team I work with is focused on culture fit, and D&amp;I. I&#x27;m actually in love with our team, it&#x27;s great to work with people that want to kill the bad name of &#x27;recruiter&#x27;. Happy to answer any questions.",
