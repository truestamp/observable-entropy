      "text": "I’ve been working on a full-stack web app project on a monorepo for the last six months. What started as a side project ended up becoming the scale of full SaaS, and I wanted to ask some questions I’ve been thinking of before releasing it to public<p>1. Github repo ownership; Organization or Personal repo<p>I’m starting to think of dividing this monorepo into three separate repos like the following:<p>- appname-site (for appname.com)\n- appname (for app.appname.com\n- appname-backend (for backend.appname.com)<p>And naturally, I figured using github organization would be easier to manage this. However, is this a common practice for a large project made by a single developer? One of my goals for this project was to have an impactful, impressive portfolio for my github. And I was worried transferring this to a github repo would make people think this wasn’t done entirely by myself. It’s hard to word this properly, but I’m worried if the perspective changes for the project’s ownership.<p>1. Public vs Private Repo<p>Maybe it’s because I’m not as experienced to open-source projects, but I am a bit hesitant opening my entire repo public as soon as I launch it. I think my main concern is that I will reduce my chances of possibly monetizing this in the future. I’m not looking to actively make profit out of this, but I do want to gather minimum amount of support allowing me to pay for hosting and scaling stuff. And of course, if the project shows promise that could be a somewhat profitable idea, I would want to fully monetize it.<p>On the other side, of course making the repo public would gather github stars, which I’ve been told are somewhat meaningful in terms of my portfolio purpose. (correct me if I’m wrong)<p>I’ve been thinking about these for a few weeks and still couldn’t make my mind up yet. Maybe I am overthinking this, but I would appreciate if anyone could share their thoughts!",
