      "text": "Even after a lot of research, I wasn&#x27;t able to find an encryption file format that is widely used and still considered &quot;supported&quot; on most platforms. The obvious answer is OpenPGP [1], but that&#x27;s widely considered &quot;not modern&quot; and some languages even deprecate their support for it (e.g. Go [2]).<p>Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for a container format like OpenPGP that can support different cipher suites, e.g. &quot;passphrase-to-key via PBKDF2, then AES-GCM-128&quot; or similar and is portable across different programming languages and operating systems.<p>I do not believe such a tool exists, but I&#x27;m scratching my head as to why. It&#x27;s 2022. TLS is iniquitous. Why is there not TLS-in-a-file?<p>My use case is my push notification project [3].
