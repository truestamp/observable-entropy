Time of year makes no difference.<p>I end up spending ~1 week recovering, before feeling normal again but by that time I&#x27;m starting work again. I tend to have to make sure I book at least two weeks, otherwise I don&#x27;t get a break.\nIf it&#x27;s relevant: I work full time, software engineer, mostly remote.<p>Anyone else have this issue or know of it happening? Or am I just overthinking an unlucky run of coincidentally-timed colds.",
