      "text": "Hi guys,\nSo today my technical co-founder just left due to academic pressure and as he can&#x27;t commit as much as I want so he just left and my ship&#x27;s been sailed since the morning. I&#x27;ve been looking for another technical person to join ASAP as we are close to pitch and seek investment as I have connections to VCs but I do need a CTO right now. I&#x27;ve been working on my idea since the last semester and I have even designed everything but the development is the only thing needs to be done. I&#x27;m in Montreal and I&#x27;m actively seeking for any enthusiast person to join in Canada.\nPlease let me know as I really am rooted for my idea and it burnt me to my heart when my CTO just left.\nthanks",
