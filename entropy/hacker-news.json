      "text": "I want to be able to spin up a Windows GUI in my browser. A box that I can interact with, without it being &#x27;headless&#x27; or CLI only. I Googled for this, but got no results. Most results were offering CLI-only Linux distros. I want to be able to surf the web, listen to music, etc<p>I&#x27;m willing to pay $5.00&#x2F;mo to have my own cloud based Windows installation that I can power on and also destroy it afterwards when I&#x27;ve finished a project.<p>Furthermore, I want this because I want to be more productive by separating machines, so I can focus on just one task. For example, an OS that is tailored <i>just</i> for coding only would be nice, instead of having one device that I use for <i>every</i> aspect of my daily computing.<p>Privacy&#x2F;Anonymity is not my concern. I won&#x27;t be doing anything sensitive in this OS.<p>Any suggestions?<p>(I&#x27;ve looked into Apache Guacamole &amp; VNC BTW. Didn&#x27;t like them).",
