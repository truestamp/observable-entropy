      "text": "I&#x27;m not really good at anything. Aside from just trying things out and getting feedback from managers&#x2F;coworkers, how does one identify things that they could be good at?<p>I&#x27;ve been a dev for 10 years and have a masters degree. I am just a midlevel dev. I spent most of that time working on obscure stuff the company needed, like Filenet and Neoxam. I&#x27;m now working with stuff like ECS batch, Lambdas, and some front end written in Java, Python, and Angular. I&#x27;m not seeing much progress. I think this mostly because I feel like this knowledge will just end up as throw away. The concepts and the bulk of the development are easy to grasp. Occasionally I&#x27;ll get stuck with some implementation detail and just let it drag out.<p>I also realize that promotions are no longer a possibility for me. People are starting to wonder why I&#x27;m still a midlevel after 10 years. Recently I was told that I need to be more upbeat and improve team morale. Basically I&#x27;m being told to change my opinions, insights, and even personality. Kind of shocking when they make a big deal about DEI, including diversity of thought. This caused me to realize that all the managers are oddly happy and upbeat, so this must be a requirement. So they won&#x27;t ever move me into any leadership position like manager, or even senior developer.<p>I think I&#x27;m tired of being a dev. The pay isn&#x27;t even that good &lt;$100k. I think some sort of an analyst position would be good. I tried checking put corporate strategy analyst positions, but it turns out they are more of a project&#x2F;stakeholder manager, and they use these positions as feeders for executive positions (the rest of the team had degrees from places like Harvard and Wharton).<p>Any suggestions of tactics or positions to try?",
