      "text": "We are seeing gaming laptops with RTX 3080 graphic cards these days being sold for just $2k, only for those being crippled and performing like RTX 3060s under stress. We are also seeing 11th gen, octa-core Intel CPUs trying to compete with AMD Ryzen processors, again being crippled from working into pretty thin laptops. It is very difficult to get unbiased reviews by top magazines and reputed influencers, though. Any reliable comparison chart out there? I suspect the best compromise for office &amp; AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;RL in mid 2021, in terms of efficiency and value for money, is a 10th gen Intel hexa core laptop with 32 GB RAM and an RTX 3060 6 GB graphic card? This would cost $1.5k and make the most of its inner limitations. Any help with actual benchmarks? Thanks!",
