I am curious if this data is for 14 days like the git clones or visitors or is there some other time frame here? I could not find anything in the documentation that talks about this. Can someone please let me know ?",

I apply for jobs and then I forget where did I apply and what was the job post (i eventually can hunt it down but it&#x27;s kinda painful). I want to be able to keep track of what questions i asked and answers I got, schedule, interview process, assignments, and other notes in a concise way. Is there a system&#x2F;method or a service that you worked for?",
