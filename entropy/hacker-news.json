      "text": "As a heavy Amazon buyer, very often I am frustrated by Amazon search results.<p>For instance, with so many fake reviews on Amazon, I seldom care about items with no or only a few reviews. Hide them plz.<p>Also, pretty often Amazon shows me stuff whose names don&#x27;t even match my search, come on!<p>Why Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow me to set how many items per page? I don&#x27;t wanna go through pages of stuff :(<p>Price Low to High is a joke! So many $0.01 items with $10 shipping fee!<p>I am writing a bookmark to fix all of these. Give it a try at heartthese.com and let me know what you think.",
