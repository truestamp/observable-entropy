      "text": "I&#x27;m a developer, a good one and that is what I do the best. I have had several projects, but I&#x27;ve always had a chicken-egg problem (how to get customers when there are no suppliers and vice versa), how to generate content... On top of all of that, I need something that I like to work on regarding development...<p>A year ago I found that project but I dropped it because people told me: &quot;Don&#x27;t do it, not worth it&quot;. I mean I did launch it but for my own country which is really small.<p>The project is about summarizing news articles, you know pulling out the most relevant information from Bible-sized articles, saving people&#x27;s time, and solving clickbait problems. With that, I solved the supplier problem, I just need to scrape news sites and have a supply. Thus it makes it easier to drive customers.<p>Also from a development perspective, it is super fun, I can keep improving my original summarization algorithm. So I&#x27;m bringing that project back to life",
