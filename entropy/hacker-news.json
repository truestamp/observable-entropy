      "text": "I find myself studying too much in order to make something that I want. For example, I want to make a dashboard of some sort. So I start learning about the history of dashboards, state of the art dashboard components, best information to show on dashboards, whether to implement them as a native, mobile, web application, and it keeps on getting deeper and deeper. I just need to build a dashboard! I sort of don&#x27;t know when to stop because I like studying too much. Feels like I&#x27;m in a never ending recursive rabbit hole of rabbit holes.<p>I do tell myself to just &quot;study enough to produce&quot; but I just can&#x27;t get the right criteria for &quot;enough&quot;.<p>I wonder whether this type of behavior is called anything so I could study about it.",
