      "text": "I am 31 years old and have been working in tech for over a decade now. I would like to go into ML research and have been studying on my own. I have a degree in History.<p>I was wondering if there are any programs that allow non-traditional backgrounds to get admitted in the CS Phd. As far as I know, all the labs will only let you admit in the program if the CS department admits you. And not having a background or degree in CS is a huge disadvantage.<p>Anyone has experience getting into PhD program without a CS degree or non-traditional degree?<p>Thanks in Advance",
