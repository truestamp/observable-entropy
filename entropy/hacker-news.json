I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;just follow your heart and build something you would want to use&quot; because I&#x27;m sure no one would care if I made yet another Genshin Impact wishes simulator, or a character planner for an RPG&#x2F;MMORPG, or even a chess game.<p>Since my goal is to build things FOR OTHERS I thought it&#x27;s wise for me to ask what would someone want to see in my portfolio. My goal is to start with frontend and pivot to backend after a few years (or sooner, depending on the company). I only do that because I read pretty much everywhere that the frontend world is more open to self-taughts than the backend world, so I&#x27;d hate climbing the metaphorical wrong wall.",
