There are no mentions about MVPs, business models, interactions with customers, funding, profits etc. I was curious how do such companies whose main activity seems to be the conduction of basic _cutting_edge_ biotech research with still a far goal of a broader application in humans do exist financially. Is it all about just getting a right long-term funding?",
