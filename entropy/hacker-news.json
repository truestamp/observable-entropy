      "text": "If I want to build a cross-platform native app for desktop and mobile devices these days, targeting Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows and Linux, is there a known &quot;good&quot; stack out there that works well, is pretty smooth and easy to get started with? I&#x27;m primarily familiar with Go and Ruby for server-side development, as well as front-end HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS, but I don&#x27;t want to build an electron app since the overall experience for the end user can be sub-optimal there. I&#x27;m not really a fan of C and its derivatives for various reasons, so I&#x27;d prefer to avoid that if possible.<p>I&#x27;ve read that you &quot;can&quot; build apps this way with .NET and Xamarin, but I haven&#x27;t seen any good beginner-level content for that stack anywhere that&#x27;s relatively up-to-date, shows how it actually works when building for the various different platforms, and I&#x27;m not entirely clear on whether you&#x27;d have to buy a microsoft visual studio license to do that or not. Plus, I&#x27;m building on MacOS and would like to release the code as open source for the project (I want to build a series of offline, no-subscription music players that sync over your local home network.)<p>I&#x27;ve heard of using Qt for this, but I can&#x27;t find any information about how to use it in a non-licensed way (I&#x27;m not paying them for a software license for something I&#x27;m going to open source anyway). Plus it looks like the language bindings are only available for C, which I&#x27;d like to avoid if possible, given the relatively steep learning curve and the fact that I haven&#x27;t touched C in ~20 something years...<p>React Native would be a good place to start, but as far as I can tell there&#x27;s no way to use that for building a desktop application, which is absolutely not optional for this endeavor.<p>I&#x27;m aware that we&#x27;re talking very different build targets, design languages and such here, but it just seems ridiculous that in 2021 we don&#x27;t have this yet, which makes me wonder: what am I missing?",
