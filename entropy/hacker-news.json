      "text": "Overall, my career looked pretty regular. Degree in CS, some internships as software developer, worked as data scientist for almost 3 years and lastly joined big company™ as service manager for a software development team (out of curiosity).<p>I find management quit appealing. I get along with the team &amp; other managers pretty well, I find my routine enjoyable, etc.. But I got one concern: I always saw my developer skills as some kind of job insurance. To me it seems obvious that I will always be able to find a job, as long as I keep my dev skills up to date.\nDoes this hold true if I stick to the management path or is my assumption just wrong? I am also involved in recruiting and I can see many managers in their 50s applying for roles such as Scrum Master or Product Owner. However, their applications are all turned down because they are way too expensive for such position.<p>In short: will I get in management in my 50s?",
