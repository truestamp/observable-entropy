      "text": "Hey HN community! Again thanks everyone for your help back at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31683412 Much appreciated!\nSo sorry I haven&#x27;t been able to respond to everyone&#x27;s messages - thanks again though!<p>For context, I&#x27;ve been doing some engineering consulting and other work for people. With the help from HN, I&#x27;ve been armed in negotation, and everyone&#x27;s advice was super good! I can know easily and swiftly tell people what we&#x27;re worth per hour! It was super hard at first, but it really helped!<p>So recently a startup with no cash, no funding came up to me to ask me to create an AI product. I managed to create a mini demo, in which they showcased this to investors and they were very impressed.<p>However we chatted about a contract between us. I came to understand that they&#x27;re offering 15% to me, with the 3 founders taking 85%. I was trying to negotitate a higher equity portion, since I believed the work I did was worth much more than 15%. They don&#x27;t seem to want to budge.<p>They then mentioned a non-compete clause, in which I declined. I run a consulting arm, so it&#x27;s nearly impossible for me to sign a non-compete clause. That&#x27;s essentially locking us out of future roles.<p>They then mentioned on time committment, however, it&#x27;s near impossible if they&#x27;re asking me to be a cofounder to determine &quot;how many&quot; hours. I told them I have other consulting roles, and so time commitment will be random. However, I&#x27;ve already spent 40 hours or more working on the product.<p>I mentioned another alternative solution which was contracting or freelance. I charged them the market rate * the hours we offered, but they seem to not want that either.<p>I told them very clearly it&#x27;s extremely difficult to find an engineer to do any software work, yet they feel like the components I&#x27;m doing aren&#x27;t valuable. I assume they&#x27;re trying to undervalue the work.<p>I&#x27;m in an extremely confused and depressed position. I&#x27;m not too sure what to do anymore! I suggested if nothing works out, then the code is protected since no contract was written.<p>What should I do in this situation? Thanks again to the wise HN community! It feels like I&#x27;m been used again. I tried this time - I guess a mistake is I should have at the start wrote a contract, and not 40 hours of work later.",
