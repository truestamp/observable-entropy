      "text": "I suck at staying in touch with people. So much that I&#x27;m planning to build an app, where I can make a list of contacts I care about and it&#x27;d notify me if I didn&#x27;t speak to someone for a long time.<p>I want to keep it simple for the everyday user. However, I think I can add more features. One feature I thought was regarding gifting. Make a note of what each person is into in the form of tags. Say tags like loves-to-cook, etc. And make a list of gifts you can give to a tag - eg: a chef&#x27;s knife.<p>What other features do you want? And how much would you pay for this app?",
