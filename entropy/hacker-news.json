      "text": "Hey HN! I’m Mason, the co-founder of Motiv.<p>Motiv is a career platform that matches candidates with jobs and lets them apply in a click.<p>Think of it like a ‘dating app’ for jobs. You can match with desirable roles and apply with one step. It’s much better than submitting a resume, because you avoid the frustration of long applications, hiring software, and being ghosted.<p>Motiv makes the hiring process convenient and transparent. Displaying jobs that match your qualities, providing updates on your applications status, while creating an experience that helps you get hired for a role you love.<p>If you’d like to use Motiv when we launch, we’d love to have you join our waitlist: www.joinmotiv.com<p>For the remainder of this post, I&#x27;ll explain why the hiring process sucks and how it&#x27;s broken.<p>There’s an old quote that reads; “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. The difference is, hiring has been broken for quite some time. It’s just that no one has fixed it. At least ‘yet’ for that manner.<p>The problem is a discrepancy between employers and candidates. Most employers think their hiring practices are great, yet are struggling to attract &#x2F; hire desirable candidates. On the flip side, candidates believe they have great talent. But are not being considered &#x2F; hired for positions they’re qualified for. While it’s frustrating, common hiring methods are a leading cause.<p>So what are they?<p>Hiring Software: Almost every organization uses some form of applicant tracking software (ATS), artificial intelligence, or machine learning to hire talent. While they differ in capabilities, each scans &#x2F; filters through candidates to select which move forward and which don&#x27;t.<p>The software takes 6 seconds to scan keywords in your resume. Based on the job description, employers will select specific words they want their ATS to find. Examples could be; &#x27;lifecycle&#x27;, &#x27;KPI&#x27;s&#x27;, or &#x27;quality assurance&#x27;. If your resume contains almost every keyword they&#x27;re looking for, great! You might move forward. If not, sorry about your luck.<p>Your resume almost needs to replicate the job description. Even if you don&#x27;t have every qualification, ATS systems could care less. They&#x27;re not evaluating your potential, they&#x27;re evaluating data. And if your resume doesn&#x27;t contain the data they&#x27;re looking for, they&#x27;ll move on.<p>Resume Formatting: So what if you have the necessary data? Are you a sure bet? Not exactly. If you&#x27;ve ever designed your resume, general knowledge is that it should &#x27;stand out&#x27;. That it needs to be eye catching, attention grabbing, and a show stopper. Something that will separate you from other candidates vying for the job. Truth is, a well designed resume won&#x27;t solve that issue.<p>Any resume not designed with a Microsoft Word format is going to get rejected as fast as it&#x27;s scanned. ATS systems don&#x27;t prioritize formatting. You could have the right keywords, great experience, and awesome skills - but if your resume looks like a work of art; the software won&#x27;t consider you. Sorry to burst your hopes if you love fancy resumes.<p>Traditional Job Boards: Traditional job boards are an easy way to find positions. Outside of that, that&#x27;s pretty much all they&#x27;re good for. While some believe they avoid ATS systems, formatting, and long applications - they generally do two things really well;<p>1. Make it frustrating to apply \n2. Make it harder to stand out<p>Think about it. If you&#x27;ve ever used a traditional job board they make you sign up, fill your information, and just as you&#x27;re ready to apply - they direct you to a company&#x27;s website. Looks familiar right? Now comes the part where you submit a resume, get scanned, and hope you make it through the software.<p>This is what we&#x27;re aiming to solve at Motiv.<p>Feel free to reach out to me anytime at; mason@joinmotiv.com and let us know your comments below. Would love to hear feedback on how we can make your hiring experience truly amazing!",
