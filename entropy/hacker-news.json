      "text": "I come from a country where most people build homes on their own. One norm that we always practice is that bathrooms are either equal in number, or more than the number of bedrooms in the house. This is because we are always an extended family, and extended family visits us. Most bedrooms have an attached bathroom + 1 (common bathroom for guests&#x2F;maids&#x2F;)<p>In America, I found that it is exact opposite. Bathrooms are less in number compared to bedrooms. My son and daughter are fighting for bathroom time as we live in a 4 Bed 2 bath house. Adding to our agony was when my parents who recently visited us. Now, one bathroom for 4 people.<p>I understand the cost implications. But compared to my house in my motherland, American house is 3 times bigger. Why can&#x27;t the builders reduce size and build more bathrooms.",
