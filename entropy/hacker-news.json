      "text": "I read that a lot of people here take privacy online very seriously. I think of privacy as a trade-off between privacy and convenience. Sure I could install an ungoogled android and only download apks from a alternative AppStore or I could just use Google Play and avoid a lot of effort. The price is my privacy. I understand that but if it comes to it convenience always triumphs over privacy. I don&#x27;t understand why I should care if some mutltibillion dollar company knows where I go and what I buy.<p>Is there something I am missing? As I understand it the battle for privacy is long lost because most people, like me, just don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s tremendous effort to fight against it. Even if you do manage to stay &quot;off the grid&quot; what&#x27;s the upsite?",
