      "text": "I&#x27;ve moved around quite a bit these past several years and I feel like every company has been the same. Management don&#x27;t know what they want the product to be. Project managers don&#x27;t know anything about technology. There&#x27;s an offshore team in Traansylvania busy making it a legacy codebase. They don&#x27;t want to give developers raises...<p>I see &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring?&quot; threads and &quot;Who Wants To Be Hired?&quot; threads. How about a &quot;Who Doesn&#x27;t Suck To Work For?&quot; thread?<p>Not sure if this will take off or get deleted ...but if it does take off, it would be great if developers --not recruiters-- replied to this. Tell us why your company is a good place to work so we can apply there :-)",

      "text": "Notifications have become such a nuisance that end-user devices have started inventing their own ways of providing a premium user experience. What happened to these apps? Did marketing take over and SPAM Gun everyone? What happens to the important transactional notifications that are filtered?<p>This is going to be an interesting battle moving into the era of GDPR, CCPA, CASL, and other regional CANSPAM acts. We&#x27;ve seen apps like Clubhouse basically disappear because everyone toggled off their notifications after being sent 10+ per day.<p>We see pop-ups making a come back now with web push and in-app. It&#x27;s obvious email is out of control. Most companies still don&#x27;t understand how to use SMS. Send times are so far off that we are receiving messages hours after our appointments and engagements about the event starting.<p>I hope that we can begin to educate and encourage appropriate notification usage by enabling observability, centralization, and recipient history|engagement to give end-users the best possible experience alongside your app. I think this post along with their tech is on the right path.<p>Notifications don&#x27;t have to suck. \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-developers-guide-user-requirements",
