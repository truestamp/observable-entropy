I don&#x27;t want to bore you with the specifics of our current situation. Instead I&#x27;m curious to hear some stories how you managed to fix your team and what problems you were able to solve.<p>For example, maybe someone actually tried to put up a &quot;Days since last incident&quot; sign and that somehow worked? Or you did something that goes against typical advice that you find when you google this topic?<p>Curious to hear your stories for some inspiration",
