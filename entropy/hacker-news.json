      "text": "I have Bose QC35 II and Airpod 3. I was satisfied with the Bose until I got the Airpods and I realized how annoying switching devices is on the Bose. It nominally connects to two device at once, but it only accepts sound from one at a time, and it often keeps &quot;playing&quot; the sound from a device that isn&#x27;t doing anything and won&#x27;t switch to the one that is playing something. The one that is playing something is silent because it&#x27;s still connected to the headphones, but they aren&#x27;t accepting it&#x27;s sound.<p>Then I need to completely disconnect the headphones from the silent device and reconnect them to the device I want to hear from.<p>Airpods on the other hand only connect to one device at a time, and I can switch between them with a single press on the device I want to connect to. It also automatically switches to the one I want most of the time. \nGranted, I&#x27;m only switching between an iPhone and a Macbook.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about getting Airpod Max, but they are ludicrously expensive and ugly IMO.<p>Have other bluetooth headphones advanced since the QC 35 II? Are Bose QC45 or 700 better at switching?<p>What about Sony XM&lt;number&gt;?",
