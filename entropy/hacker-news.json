      "text": "Hello, backend dev here. I want to build some very specific gui stuff for linux desktop and i am confused. Let me first tell you what I want to build. Then I will explain my confusion. So I want to build something like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ricotz&#x2F;plank and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xfce-mirror&#x2F;xfce4-panel. It is not supposed to be cross platform, specifically for linux x86 64 bit. For Xorg specifically.<p>So I am thinking about some sort of application, that does it and is fullscreen and borderless by default. Both these apps cannot be seperate windows.\nI want plank at the bottom screen to show pinned apps and apps that are currently running with their window preview on hovering over. The top panel needs to have a global menu like macos and an application tray for installed apps. Need to show icons for steam or discord running on top panel. So it needs to support systray icons.<p>I don&#x27;t want to use vala+gtk or c+qt.<p>Can I use flutter, react native or tauri to do this? I don&#x27;t want to use electron. I don&#x27;t know dart rust or javascript right now.",

      "text": "Hi HN!<p>For the past 3 days, I have been actively working on a URL shortener called FlyURL. It started as a project to help me learn Python and Flask, but now has grown into a pretty big project.<p>Some main differences between FlyURL and other self-hosted URL shorteners (like Pckd[0] or Shlink[1]):<p>- FlyURL is ONLY compatible with SQLite (Unlike Pckd)<p>- FlyURL has NO API or CLI (Unlike Shlink)<p>- FlyURL has really basic tracking (Only by clicks), while Pckd and Shlink features more robust tracking (This is something on working)<p>- FlyURL has a clean and basic UI (Influenced by is.gd[2], and thanks to Lit[3])\n- FlyURL requires NO logins (Influenced by chilp.it[6])<p>- FlyURL uses blacklist from Steven Black&#x27;s hosts[4] and its in-house URL shortener service list[5] to block harmful websites and prevent creating a &quot;chain&quot; of URLs (Influenced by is.gd) (I&#x27;m not sure if Pckd or Shlink do the same, but it&#x27;s likely they do)<p>- FlyURL is built with Python and Flask (Shlink is built with PHP, and Pckd is built with React)<p>If you want a URL shortener that just works, then FlyURL may fit for you. If you want more features and more robust, then Shlink and Pckd are better choices.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PckdHQ&#x2F;Pckd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PckdHQ&#x2F;Pckd</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shlink.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shlink.io&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;is.gd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;is.gd</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ajusa.github.io&#x2F;lit&#x2F;docs&#x2F;lit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ajusa.github.io&#x2F;lit&#x2F;docs&#x2F;lit.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StevenBlack&#x2F;hosts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StevenBlack&#x2F;hosts</a><p>[5]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;HoangTuan110&#x2F;e6eb412ed32657c841fcc2c12c156f9d\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;HoangTuan110&#x2F;e6eb412ed32657c841fcc2c...</a><p>[6]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chilp.it\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chilp.it</a>",
