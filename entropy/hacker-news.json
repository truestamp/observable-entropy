      "text": "I was recently in a discussion with what I consider like-minded individuals. The conversation happened upon AWS accounts and how one should structure it (besides running it in an AWS Organisation... that is a no-brainer).<p>One side of the discussion meant that one should limit the amount of AWS accounts one had, due to the risk of account sprawl.<p>The other side meant that one should not impose such a restriction, as AWS accounts come with no cost and tools exists for managing them.<p>Now, I am convinced that one should use AWS accounts to house individual workloads if possible. There are of course exceptions to this, but overall I think it&#x27;s the right way to do it. With the soft limitations AWS puts in place on the number of VPCs and such, I get the feeling that AWS feels the same way. They also seem to mention something about using accounts as security barriers in their best practices.<p>I&#x27;m also convinced that plenty of organisations deal with hundreds, if not thousands of AWS accounts on a daily basis without too much issue. Now, I have no data to back this up, hence why I submitted this.<p>Could people, in rough estimates, answer this simple questions: How many AWS accounts does your organisation have?<p>50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1000+?<p>I&#x27;ve been in organisations with ~500 and in organisations with ~50.",
