      "text": "I&#x27;ve used Windows, macOS, and GNU-Linux. Now I use Windows on desktop, but I have this temptation to try Linux again, mainly out of curiosity. But there are tens if not hundreds of Linux &quot;flavors&quot;, and a lot of them have so much in common (e.g., Ubuntu is based on Debian), and yet, there are major differences among them, such as how they provide updates (e.g., rolling release) or the hardware that they target.<p>In a sense, one can&#x27;t call all of them _one_ OS, whereas you would call all versions of Windows basically one OS that has been consistently updated throughout the years.<p>I wonder if so many Linux distros is actually Linux&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; heel. IMO, it&#x27;d be better if these sparse efforts would get focused on _one_ solid, no-frets, no-hassle, Linux OS that ordinary people could trust to be stable and reliable for years to come.",
