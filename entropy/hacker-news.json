      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>The company I&#x27;m working at has a growth team which basically means in our team of PM + engineers + designers we also have + Growth Manager who&#x27;s job is basically to design and run a load of experiments to increase some metrics about the product.<p>But (obviously?) when I say &quot;run experiments&quot; what I mean is &quot;get the engineering team to implement loads of stuff and then track it over the week&quot;. This is fine, because usually its pretty simple stuff, but her tickets never seem to get prioritised and so she ends up only running like one experiment a week and I think she&#x27;s pretty demoralised about the whole thing.<p>I know companies like Amazon AB test everything, so there must be good best practices here? Does anyone know any strategies or products that would help either: \n- Her do it herself? (seems unlikely she could get everything done without engineering support, but maybe she could do some simple stuff)\n- Us to work more effectively as a team and actually get more experiments shipped.<p>Thanks!",
