Embedding them into GitHub READMEs, tweets and documentation would be awesome.<p>Google do it to illustrate posts (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chromium.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;a-safer-default-for-navigation-https.html).<p>I found Excalidraw Claymate [2] but the stop motion approach with no tweening support makes it painful to create animations where circles move from place to place.
