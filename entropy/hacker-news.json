Archive.org isn&#x27;t helping...nothing at salvo.com but I&#x27;m not even sure that was the address. This would have been around 1994-95... it was kind of an anarchist &#x2F; foreign policy zine if I remember. Not the current Christian fundamentalist magazine called &quot;Salvo&quot; at salvomag.com, which seems to have been around since 2006 (although the new one has really funny headlines like &quot;How Pornography and Drugs Changes your Brain&quot; [sic]).<p>Anyone got a recollection or a copy of what I&#x27;m talking about?",
