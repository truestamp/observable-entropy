      "text": "Here is a list of sourced facts:<p>At the highest level in Russia, they are operating with typewriters, bypassing any computer surveillance, so we might have no clue how they operate[0]. They have tested separating their entire countries networks from the internet and making sure everything still works[1]. Right now they are selling their oil only in Rubles[2]. Like other countries, they have planned a digital currency, but the Bank of Russia started the pilot stage of the digital ruble 2 days before the Ukrainian invasion[3]. According to the IMF, Russia&#x27;s national debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 18.9% at the end of 2020, making Russia one of the least indebted countries in the world[4]. Russia allows its businesses to steal patents from anyone in ‘unfriendly’ countries[5].<p>My hypothesis:<p>Russia has planned to become as independent as possible, to become the first major nation state to issue a digital currency, and use their oil exports to force its spread. With the ability to now not regard patent law, they will be a safe haven to companies that will be able to create copycats of existing technology, and allow for innovation at a much higher rate. I think that the sanctions against Russia will perhaps have the inverse effect people predicted, and make them more patriotic now that they are seen as enemies by many.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;to-avoid-leaks-russia-turns-to-typewriters&#x2F;<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-50902496<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;2146333&#x2F;russia-wants-the-west-to-pay-for-oil-and-gas-in-rubles&#x2F;<p>[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;16&#x2F;bank-of-russia-proceeds-with-digital-ruble-renews-push-for-crypto-ban&#x2F;<p>[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commodity.com&#x2F;data&#x2F;russia&#x2F;debt-clock&#x2F;<p>[5]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;09&#x2F;russia-allows-patent-theft&#x2F;",
