      "text": "My employer (in the UK) has taken a strong stance on RTO, and they&#x27;re tracking it with in office day % targets at a team level.<p>They have created a mobile application which has:<p>- a map of all desks, which is clickable to show who is logged in at a particular desk, their name and photo and whether they are online&#x2F;away&#x2F;busy<p>- a way to look up where a person is sat, or whether they are working from home<p>Anyone can access this at any time so it is starting to be used as a way to see how long individuals (as opposed to the team) are around and whether they are coming in for more than the required number of days.<p>My question is not so much whether employers can collect this data, but whether they are allowed to share it with all other employees? I would have thought that this counts as &quot;personal data&quot; and there would be controls on who should be able to look at it.",
