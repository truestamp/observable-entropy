      "text": "Now that Spotify&#x27;s 2021 Wrapped was just released, it got me to thinking that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a platform that encourages sharing music recommendations, albums, playlists, etc. between your friends. It seems on Spotify the only way to &quot;find friends&quot; is to connect the app through Facebook which is not ideal. Do people just not care about this feature? Are people generally reserved about their music tastes and prefer to keep things private?<p>I remember back in the day there was Last.fm and the concept of scrobbling as an interesting way of seeing what your friends are listening to. Playing your song on Myspace was also a great way to show your friends what music you&#x27;re interested in and finding new bands. Why is this so difficult in 2021?",
