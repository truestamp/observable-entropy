Listing of all topics at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lokopakar.com&#x2F;?page_id=1539<p>We have realized many people are interested to talk about small topics that matter to them, rather than only the big topics that matters to politicians and the World.<p>So we were thinking of starting something similar online for everyone. Our question is would you be interested or would there be interest?<p>Also we are seeking ideas and advice on how such groups could meet for sessions. Current approach we are thinking is people suggest topics in Google form. Then Calendly setup is done for people to select dates to talk on. Then Google Meet link sent for conversation. We could do only audio, if people like that. Target group will be 20-30 at max per session.",
