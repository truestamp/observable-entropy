I don&#x27;t want to limit this conversation to sofware engineering&#x2F;IT in general, so feel free to comment no matter your field.<p>To start, I&#x27;ve summed up some of my research for software engineering. Some things are more clear cut, others heavily opinionated:<p>- Learn as much as you can, try to have fun working, have at least x% of your waking day as quality leisure time, and don&#x27;t burn out.<p>- Just get more experience<p>- Do side project work<p>- Contribute to popular open-source code<p>- Work at a big, well known company<p>Looking forward to your input!",
