      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on a project where we have to verify user phone numbers. Initially, I went ahead with AWS SNS which was pretty convenient, however, later I saw it would fail for some countries. Since AWS doesn&#x27;t provide free support, I switched to MessageBird. Found that they failed in the same countries as AWS. On asking support, it turns out we have to register Sender ID in some countries to send SMS. And it could take a month or two to do that. And there are actually way too many countries on the list to handle all that manually.<p>This is a really painful experience. Is there any solution out there with &gt;99% coverage of countries for SMS (without me having to register a SenderID for those countries). All I want to do is send one time verification code to verify phone, that&#x27;s it. No promo SMS later.<p>This seems like a very common problem, and most known SMS platforms I looked up ask us to handle the SenderID thing. Surely, there&#x27;s something more convenient out there.",
