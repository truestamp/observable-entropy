I thought I would have had it in my favorites or upvoted submissions, but I could have failed to parse the titles to find it when I was digging, or not upvoted it at the time, two to six years ago? Yeah, hard to remember.<p>I’m hoping someone here will recognize the description and be able to point me to the site.<p>It was a very simple site that described how to make solvents, detergents, polishes, varnishes, glass cleaner, sanitizer? etc… I can’t remember if it was with household items or with easily obtainable chemicals or reagents, but it was probably one of the two. It may also have had descriptions of tools for a home lab…<p>The page was, if memory serves, simple, on a large screen took up a postcard sized space on a 1080p screen. Was black on grey-ish, maybe beige with a nice font. Images were included of some concoctions, I think in color featuring a lot of glass and wood. The site was simple and mostly text with some lists. I feel like I loved the aesthetic.<p>Any leads?",
