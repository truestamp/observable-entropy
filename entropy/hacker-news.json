That&#x27;s 22,000 systems using a full CPU core every week...adding wear and heat and power consumption.<p>Likewise, marketing for this fastest hardware generally consists of a product that&#x27;s 140% the cost, 110% of the performance, and 120% of the power consumed due to processor binning and supply&#x2F;demand curves.<p>SaaS is a bottomless hole where you throw your processing without thought of power consumption, just write a check and make it go away.<p>Flight Simulator 2020 requires a 250gb download, every couple of months. Every endpoint, every cable modem, every Akamai cache.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to even formulate the statement: Maybe consider your carbon footprint when performing that next full code compile?",
