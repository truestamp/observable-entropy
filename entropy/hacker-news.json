Be sure to check every single profile, though. Check for activity, trolls, original content, followback ratio, etc. Compile the list, add the hashtag &quot;TruthTrain&quot; and let it ride! A couple instructions are always helpful as well, like reminding people to ReTruth and following everyone. DO NOT COPY TRAINS PLEASE! They take a long time to make and adding the sams people to a train multiple times defeats the purpose.”<p>“Collection, depends on apps you use on your phone. I use a memo to paste them in, then you have to clean them up. As far as the 7.5k max, once you amass more than 7.5k followers you can follow again. Always stay just a tad under your followers vs following, you play catch-up at times but you won’t max out”",
