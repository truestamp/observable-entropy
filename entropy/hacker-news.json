However, I&#x27;m the only one in the family that is willing to learn such tools.<p>I&#x27;ve used paid solutions, hated some and loved others. Lunch money was amazing. But my workflow with Hledger still brings back fond memories. With our next child due in 5 weeks I&#x27;m setting up our new budget and want to return to plain text accounting.<p>There are some missing features with Hledger. My wife would like to see how much remains in each category. Preferably via mobile phone.<p>Using plain text tools means I&#x27;m restricting data entry to me. It would be ideal if my wife could have a user friendly interface, but not essential.<p>I&#x27;m hoping some of you run similar setups and might have some suggestions.",
