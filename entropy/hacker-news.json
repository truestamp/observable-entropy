      "text": "I do a lot of searching of Google Books. I&#x27;ve noticed that in the last month or so, I&#x27;m seeing a lot more inside-the-book searches that give me a &quot;no preview available for this page.&quot;<p>I even seen this when searching for terms that are literally on the page I&#x27;m previewing. They show up in my results list but still have &quot;no preview available&quot; and no page number.<p>Is this some policy change? A bug? I can&#x27;t find any announcements about this. It definitely makes Google Books far less functional for me.<p>Of course, I&#x27;d love to live in a world where Google doesn&#x27;t have this ridiculous pseudo-monopoly on book search. But this is not the world we live in.",
