      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Python for a while now, but there&#x27;s a (somewhat elitist) trend that prefers Julia to Python, mainly because of better performance and type classes. I know that Julia still has a long way to go in regards to libraries (compared to Python, at least). But is there something about Julia that is a disadvantage compared to Python? The engineer inside me thinks there&#x27;s no free lunch, and Julia can&#x27;t be superior in every way.",
