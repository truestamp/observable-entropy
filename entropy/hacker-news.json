      "text": "A few days, ago, I posted [1] on Show HN. It was my first serious project and one that I had decided to actually ask people for feedback. While I did get a few encouraging words and some criticism which I&#x27;ve been working on a lot, I&#x27;ve been getting VERY few downloads (pip installs, here) in the past few days. I&#x27;m talking an average of 1-2 or maybe if I&#x27;m lucky, 5 a day. It&#x27;s been only getting worse in the past week - especially in the past few days, and it doesn&#x27;t look like having too much scope further on. How do I come to terms that something I&#x27;ve worked so hard on for the past month is probably dwindling down? I want to learn from this, and it gets very hard to see it go and accept it&#x27;s a failed one. \nThanks for any advice.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27782397",
