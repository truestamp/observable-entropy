Wherever I looked at the world&#x27;s problems, more technology seemed to be the answer.<p>Nowadays I&#x27;m a software dev and tech entrepreneur. At best, technology bores me. At worst, it terrifies me. Today&#x27;s startups are solving the most boring problems imaginable. Gadgets are a snoozfest. Programming languages and frameworks seem to be running in circles.<p>We seem to be experiencing diminishing returns on tech for the past few years. More tech is no longer necessarily better. Is this just a phase before the next big industrial revolution?<p>When did this start, and when is the drought going to be over?",

I&#x27;m an academic so I&#x27;m not really after trivial pop, but something that deals with the concepts at stake (energy, work, conservation, entropy, Maxwell demon, etc etc), their history, but from the ground up. I also can&#x27;t stand overly-excitable YouTubers, so ideally not that either.",
