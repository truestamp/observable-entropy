      "text": "I knew Google&#x27;s automated processes were pretty bad from earlier stories here, but today I got hit by it myself.<p>I participated in the totally legit EthGlobal &quot;Hack Money&quot; hackathon (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackathon.money&#x2F;) earlier this year and one of required submissions of that event was a video describing your work.\nI made one and uploaded it to Youtube. The hackathon went great and we won some prizes but that&#x27;s not relevant to this story.<p>Yesterday evening I received an email from Youtube that they&#x27;ve removed my channel because &quot;Spam, scams or commercially deceptive content are not allowed on YouTube.&quot;.<p>I thought this certainly must be an error so I used the attached appeal link and got a response within less than 15 minutes that they appeal has been rejected and that no further replies will be processed.<p>I am a paid Youtube Music subscriber and I can&#x27;t login to even listen to my own music anymore. Amazing.<p>I would like to think that Google&#x27;s AI systems are smarter than just videoTitle.contains(&quot;hack&quot;) &amp;&amp; videoTitle.contains(&quot;money&quot;), but apparently not.<p>If anybody has connections who can help get me unsuspended that would be highly appreciated. The google cache of my channel is still available here:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache:gcYJ--i6UYgJ:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;MathijsVogelzang+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=nl",
