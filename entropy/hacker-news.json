      "text": "I&#x27;ve heard the term thrown around a lot recently and I was curious what this community thinks about the term and the trend?<p>It seems like the term &quot;web 3.0&quot; has been used for a while now and has been applied to different things from an AI-focused web to the more recent iteration where it&#x27;s being used to describe the trend towards user-own decentralised services and blockchain applications.<p>While we&#x27;ve seen a few decentralised technologies emerge in recent years (mastodon, blockchain, etc) I&#x27;m quite sceptical of how far this decentralised movement will go. Aside from digital currencies, useful applications of Blockchain seem relatively niche and a significant push towards decentralisation more generally seem unlikely given the lack of economic incentives for the established players (MS, FB, Google, Apple) to allow users to own their own data and services.<p>I generally tend to be quite sceptical of tech trends though so I&#x27;m curious if there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;m missing here or if there&#x27;s something I should be looking into?",
