      "text": "My team uses sprints and I&#x27;m realizing our need doesnt really match how sprints work. Nothing gets cut, we end up just moving everything over to the next sprint over and over until the features are complete. Sprint plannings are mostly a waste of everyone&#x27;s time as nothing valid happens beyond ticket assingment (except everyone already mostly knows what they should be working on)<p>The only super useful meetings we have is grooming where we talk through each ticket within each respective discipline.<p>I am looking into kanban which feels a lot more &quot;right&quot; to our workflow. Wondering for those of you who are using kanban, what is the difference, assuming you&#x27;ve done your classic scrum stuff in the past.",
