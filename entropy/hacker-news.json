      "text": "Dear HN<p>I&#x27;m a Computer Science student, specializing in Artifical Intelligence, who is currently nearing  the end of his second last year of university. This means I&#x27;ll have to do my Master&#x27;s Thesis next year. However, we must already choose a topic this year.<p>My university offers quite a lot of topics, but none of them got me excited. None of them gave me the idea: &quot;This seems fun, I really want to work a whole year on this&quot;, which is unfortunate. When you have to spend at least 700 estimated hours on something, it better gets you excited. It better be something you really want to work on.<p>There is a bright spot. We are allowed to propose a topic ourselves (which is not included in the list of topics). This may be in correspondence with a company. The idea to ask HN for a thesis proposal suddenly popped into my head, which leads to the following questions:<p>Do you have a thesis proposal for me? Or does your company have a thesis proposal for me?<p>If you can answer any of those questions with a &quot;yes&quot;, feel free to reach out to me at hn_sebos [@] protonmail.com. Additional questions are always welcome.",

      "text": "My Macbook Pro order looks to be still months away from shipping and I’ve started to consider the “light laptop as a terminal for a beefy Linux desktop” alternative. If you happen to use such a setup what does it look like and how well has it served your needs? Is there specific VNC software or a Tmux plugin you could not live without?<p>Setups that come to mind for me are<p>1. RDP&#x2F;remote desktop methods. Pros: You can run everything as if using a regular computer. Persistent, all the apps and windows are kept in place and running even if you disconnect. Cons: Additional latency. On my naive xrdp attempt I could not get 4k resolution usable, plus Ubuntu kept asking for my root password for various things every minute.<p>2. VSCode remote SSH. Pros: Low latency and very easy setup. Cons: Only for command line apps and web dev. Cant resume terminal instances after a longer disconnect.<p>3. Remote terminal (ex. SSH&#x2F;Mosh). Pros: Low latency with mosh. App&#x2F;window persistence with Tmux. Cons: Steeper learning curve. Only for command line apps.<p>4. Fully online IDE. Pros: Very easy, similar to VSCode with SSH remote. Cons: Unregular keyboard shortcuts are needed to avoid hitting browser shortcuts. Cost usually scales with hours of use or number of projects.",
