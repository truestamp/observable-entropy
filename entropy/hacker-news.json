      "text": "I wonder, what will replace traditional devices. If sci fi movies are right, the future will be holographic displays. Meta seems to think it&#x27;s the metaverse, which sounds to me like it could be VR (They couldn&#x27;t possibly be so pathetic as to imagine a simple super app could pass as a &quot;metaverse&quot;).

Wanted to get some advice from the community - I&#x27;m currently a platform engineer and want to move into a more software development focused role and then into app sec in a few years. As part of my career dev plan, my manager approved me to attend 2 conferences this year, so long as 1 is developer&#x2F;app dev focused and 1 is app sec focused.<p>Are there any conferences that you&#x27;d recommend from your experience?<p>Thanks!",
