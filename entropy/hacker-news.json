      "text": "Reader modes have become a very important browser feature for me. I can&#x27;t read an article on the internet these days without them. They allow me to avoid the autoplay videos, newsletter subscription popups, and the other annoying web design trends that plague news and publication websites. Sometimes I can even skip the paywalls!<p>Here&#x27;s a low-effort comparison between the readers on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.<p>Chrome: Hidden by default, accessible via chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;flags, a choice of three fonts (Serif, Sans-Serif, and Monospace), white&#x2F;sepia&#x2F;dark modes, and a content scale slider. Clearly not a priority for Chrome devs.<p>Firefox: Accessible by keyboard command (Option+Command+R on Mac), Two fonts only (Serif and Sans-Serif), font size adjustment, white&#x2F;sepia&#x2F;dark modes, and independent height and width adjustments for content. You also get a read aloud feature and a Save to Pocket button if happen to use Pocket.<p>Edge: 3 fonts (Calibri, Sitka and ugh, Comic Sans), text size slider, 3 text column sizes, and a lot more colors for reader theme than just white&#x2F;sepia&#x2F;dark. Probably has the most extra features. Access with F9, translation, line focus, grammar tools, and a read aloud that I prefer over Firefox&#x27;s.<p>Here&#x27;s a previous discussion: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28286493<p>What do you all think about reader modes? Essential or ignore-able?",
