      "text": "A couple of years ago I had an idea for a gender slider. The basic idea is that instead of a dropdown different specific values, you slide along a slider between two values. So in it&#x27;s most basic form, you&#x27;d slide between male and female, somewhere inbetween is where you are.<p>Initially I thought this would be a one-time entry thing. But then I thought that it be nice to track gender over time. I.e. sliding each day over a month would give you an average of how you felt that month.<p>Then I realised that if other people were going to do this, then I didn&#x27;t want to know what their average meant nor their gender nor anything else. So I decided to replace the specific gender values with colours. So you slide between two colors, their meaning is up to you, and at the end of the month you get a &quot;average&quot; colour.<p>Ironically, it seems, that there is a real need for such a slider. A child of a brother-of-different-mother would love to use it but because it&#x27;s not an app (i.e. iOS dungeon ..err.. market or Google cave ..err... store) she won&#x27;t use it (its just a web page - in fact a large SVG). Basically it needs to be a button on the home screen (I know, browser can put bookmarks on screens but try explaining that to a non-tech teenager).<p>I really don&#x27;t want to get into building apps for android nor iOS, so if anyone is interested in doing this, then please do.<p>Monetisation would definitely not come from selling data (even that isn&#x27;t possible in the current implementation [1]). A couple of things I was thinking about was perhaps being able to change colour would a premium feature. Or perhaps using a circle, i.e. 2 dimensional sliding could also be premium.<p>But of course, the premium feature that would be the cash cow would be an edit button ... if you forget to slide on a particular day, then you pay to change history.<p>Anyway a semi tongue-in-cheek write up[1] and the webapp[2] are both available. Thanks for reading this far!<p>[1]=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gregorius.rippenstein.art&#x2F;works&#x2F;slider\n[2]=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gender.sldr.in",
