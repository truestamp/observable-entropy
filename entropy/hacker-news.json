      "text": "Hi everyone!\nSeveral years ago, I launched my startup G-71 Inc., which required B2B sales to succeed. After a difficult period of independent sales, we thought about attracting external sales.<p>After many dozens of meetings with various salespeople, I faced the same questions and problems from the sales side. It took me several months to train sales and several joint meetings with buyers to start selling independently.<p>Combining all this experience, I figured out how to make it easier for myself and other startups to sell. I figured out how to make sure that any external salesperson can sell any startup solution to their customers if it suits them. At the same time, there are no monthly commissions, only commissions for closed transactions.<p>Today we are presenting our ICANSELL product at Product Hunt.\nPlease support our project: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;icansell",
