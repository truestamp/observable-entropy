Leaving books and Stack Overflow aside, the value of projects is in their demonstration: the maturity&#x2F;immaturity, advantages&#x2F;drawbacks of particular tools and techniques.<p>The following projects have been of great pedagogical use to me:<p>&lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;makani&#x2F;&gt; (Bazel, C, testing, architecture, real-time control, code-generation)<p>&lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;odriverobotics&#x2F;ODrive&gt; (real-time control, code-generation, C++)<p>&lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FreeRTOS&#x2F;FreeRTOS-Kernel&gt; (architecture, C)<p>&lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;espressif&#x2F;esp-idf&gt; (architecture, C, CMake, testing)<p>Which embedded software projects have you learned from and what have you learned from them?",

Only after a few minutes did the guy realize the perplexity of the situation. How do you insure against a race condition in a public forum with no way to direct message?<p>Luckily, he nabbed the invite code, but it got me thinking about using PGP to provide a solution. This is meant to be a rough PoC and the UX is definitely not ready for the average Joe, but the functionality I&#x27;d like to think is there.<p>Btw, &quot;this page uses NO SERVER&quot; just means it&#x27;s static.

      "text": "I want to create a pseudonymous blog. Requirements being:\n1- can’t be tied back to my real identity. At least not until some state actor wants it. \n2- not easily censorable. I’d describe Twitter and Facebook as being easily censorable since if a mob of people report your account, they will suspend it. Again, I don’t want it to be completely censorproof. Like if AWS decides to take it down - that’s not a scenario I want to protect against. But at the same time I don’t want to be at the mercy of some random platform’s content evaluation team.\n3- simple setup. I am technical but not Linux hacker technical.<p>Imagine if someone like Jordan Peterson had to write a blog without the fear of being cancelled, or losing their job. He has controversial opinions but he is also not trying to incite an attack at Capitol.<p>Simplest option seems to be to buy a domain and self host. But could my identity be linked to email via domain name?",
