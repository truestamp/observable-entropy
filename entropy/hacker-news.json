      "text": " (Throwaway for obvious reasons)<p>I&#x27;m in the late rounds of interviewing at Meta&#x2F;FB for an intern position. I was extremely lucky to get this opportunity, and the interviews so far have gone really well. I think I will get the position.<p>Because this would be my first position in industry, it&#x27;s already difficult to get my foot in the door.<p>However, The news I keep seeing around Meta lead me to think the whole thing is a sinking ship. Should I actually accept the offer? I have no confidence in the Metaverse, and the &quot;Metamates&quot; stuff just comes off as delusional.<p>From my perspective, the Meta&#x2F;Metaverse rebranding isn&#x27;t a sign of growth but rather a sign of desperation. It seems a bit silly to work at a company you have no confidence in, and one that the average person seems to hate, but getting my foot in the door is hard enough as it is.<p>Is Meta a sinking ship? Should I actually continue with the offer and hope to pivot to something else in the future?",
