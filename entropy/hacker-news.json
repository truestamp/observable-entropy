      "text": "I want to run web-servers from home, with public DNS, but I&#x27;m worried that my IP address will change. I&#x27;m willing to pay in the range of $100 &#x2F; month for some sort of proxy, and I only need about 98% uptime.<p>Is there some sort of service, similar to ngrok[0], that will:\na) have a consistent IP address that I can point a DNS at\nb) forward all requests (maybe some weird ports &#x2F; protocols) over some tunnel to my local machines\nc) let my local machines re-establish the tunnels across restarts<p>Context:<p>I don&#x27;t _need_ to do this. I just want to.<p>I have 3 Intel NUC[1] boxes at home, on battery backup, hard-wired to two residential fiber internet connections for redundancy (Google Fiber &amp; AT&amp;T).<p>One of these is an Ethereum validator[2], which has been successfully running for almost a year now. It&#x27;s had ~98% uptime, which is good enough for my needs.<p>I&#x27;m interested in helping other proof-of-stake networks grow, and they all have different hardware &amp; networking requirements. In particular, one of them requires a public DNS entry for each of my nodes.<p>I sort-of like the idea that the networks are more &quot;decentralized&quot; when running in my house vs in a datacenter somewhere... But honestly, I just think it&#x27;s more fun to own the machines (pets, not cattle[3]).<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ngrok.com&#x2F;\n[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newegg.com&#x2F;intel-blknuc7i7dnk1e&#x2F;p&#x2F;N82E16856102205?Item=9SIA2F873V9947\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beaconscan.com&#x2F;validator&#x2F;0xaf21b320e306f2e932748403cc4c0a8a8fc78bcf2ccabbc3f04f7242cc7448ba5cc2995267d68d134ca8fa63e6256113\n[3]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudscaling.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cloud-computing&#x2F;the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle&#x2F;",
