      "text": "I&#x27;m a software developer that recently get interested in application security. I don&#x27;t have any formal training in that field yet, most of my knowledge are from portswigger.net&#x27;s top lists and games (like microcorruption.com). I&#x27;ve applied some of those to find bugs in my team&#x27;s product, just some basic ones: mostly denial of service and some others like CSRF, XSS, padding oracle attack... But if someone ask me how to secure a system then I won&#x27;t even know where to begin, the massive amount of attacks out there really make me nervous\nSo, is there any role&#x2F;position for people like me, newbie, to learn from the job? (from my experience, being a developer really helped in finding&#x2F;testing scenarios that could lead to security bugs, so I guess I&#x27;m having a little more advantage than a real newbie). And what are your suggestions&#x2F;resources for self learning to become familiar with the field?",
