      "text": "13 years ago, Bitcoin was released and we still cannot use Bitcoin for payments or anything useful as it was originally intended. Even &#x27;Satoshi&#x27; has reportedly &#x27;given up&#x27; and has recently started selling NFTs himself. [0] [1]<p>I believe now is the time to strongly consider completely banning this experiment and stopping it altogether. We want to actually do something about this as I keep seeing scammers everywhere and it is starting to show up on ad banners in cities.<p>I am not even sure regulation would do or change anything as long as these cryptobros and scams still exist.<p>So how do we start to ban cryptocurrencies entirely?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;p2pfoundation.ning.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;topics&#x2F;bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A169634<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensea.io&#x2F;satoshinak",

      "text": "Recently there were some discussions regarding the fact that Google is no longer producing high quality results.<p>I’m not sure wether this has been already implemented by any search engine but I thought it for a while: can search results be improved by also checking&#x2F;ranking the time spent by the user on the relative page? Maybe by playing a bit with URLs and redirects?<p>For instance, if a lot of people are visiting a page and are not leaving it (not going back to the search results), then most probably it means that the page is pretty valid (high rank). If a lot of people are visiting a page and are leaving it after few seconds, then most probably it means that the page is not valid (low rank).",
