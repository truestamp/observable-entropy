      "text": "So for quite a while now if I get a Twitter browser push notification I get taken to the user who has the username of &quot;tweet&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure exactly when this started happening but if you look at this tweet you can see over a thousand replies from people asking why they were brought to this page.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tweet&#x2F;status&#x2F;1465053672593784834<p>It would appear a user changed their username to &quot;tweet&quot; at some point and so the URL the browser push notification directs you to (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tweet?id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) takes you to their profile page instead of the tweet referenced in the push notification.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat astounding to me that this has been happening since at least February of this year (judging by the date on some of these replies) and no one at Twitter has noticed or cared.<p>Is anyone else here experiencing this? I know I&#x27;m not the only one from the replies but again, it&#x27;s crazy that Twitter hasn&#x27;t fixed this. I&#x27;m guessing the power-twitter users&#x2F;employees don&#x27;t notice since they use one of the Twitter apps on desktop instead of relying on the browser notifications.",
