      "text": "I&#x27;m very risk averse IRL and am prone to &quot;turtle&quot; or &quot;hoard&quot; what I have. This mindset does NOT help me with my investments where a certain tolerance for risk is necessary to get reward.<p>Are there any games (video, not board) that can help me flex my risk tolerance muscle so I&#x27;m able to be less &quot;scared&quot; in reality and less risk averse?<p>Some thoughts on requirements:<p>- Immediate feedback through a failure state: don&#x27;t want to spend 90% of the game building and 10% of the time risking what I&#x27;ve built\n- Less about game proficiency&#x2F;mechanics and more about provoking an emotional response which I can then confront and work through\n- Would prefer a controlled, PvE environment so I can remove the variables of exploiters and better players from the equation (though this would be something useful to jolt a plateaued learning curve)\n- Something that can be done without a sophisticated setup<p>Here are some games I&#x27;ve thought of and why they won&#x27;t work (although I may be approaching them wrong):<p>- Humankind, Civ 6, etc.\n    - Risk occurs late in the game\n    - Feedback isn&#x27;t immediate and would require analysis\n    - Large amount of build-up\n- FPS\n    - Requires technical and game proficiency\n- MMO FPS (Valorant, Overwatch)\n    - Too many uncontrolled variables\n- Builders, i.e. Rimworld, Factorio, Anno 1800, etc.\n    - More micro-manage-y than risky\n    - Excessive setup before actual risk is faced\n    - Feedback would only occur after analysis<p>I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know so any ideas&#x2F;comments are greatly appreciated!<p>This is an article I found but it&#x27;s board games: [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creativelive.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;take-more-risks-board-games&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creativelive.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;take-more-risks-board-games&#x2F;)",
