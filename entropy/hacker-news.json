      "text": "It&#x27;s actually sort of funny. Not for the receiving end, which would likely be able to negotiate or just suspend their service instead of owing $38k, but still. There should be a documentary on this if I&#x27;m being honest.<p>Today&#x27;s topic: Content Delivery Networks that charge per request.<p>It&#x27;s a common practice but it&#x27;s horrific for smaller companies that can&#x27;t negotiate contracts.<p>Fastly, CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN and more all charge for requests made to CDN deployments.<p>Vultr. Linode. Digital Ocean. -and more. $5&#x2F;month for a not too terrible server and 1TB of egress. Not a threat until you spam someone&#x27;s CDN deployment. And no, I&#x27;m not talking about 1TB. I&#x27;m talking about sending 51 billion requests a month to CDN endpoints for $5&#x2F;month. Want to mitigate that? That&#x27;ll cost 10x the amount per request for Google Cloud Armor or Amazon WAF (not kidding). I&#x27;m sure this actually is&#x27;t a common practice, but it makes you wonder about the companies that switch from enterprise CDNs to Cloudflare.......<p>HTTP stress testing software like wrk is wickedly powerful and insightful. WRK can easily send 20k requests per second per core. Find a resource small enough and it&#x27;s game over for the receiving end. It can easily be used as a tool for your worst enemies. The only way to mitigate it is to host your own solution, like Varnish etc. or negotiate a contract with the CDN provider, which will costs hundreds or thousands of dollars a month. Not a likely solution for small to medium sized businesses.<p>Thoughts? Comments? Stories? Ideas?",
