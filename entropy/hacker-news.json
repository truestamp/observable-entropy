I am curious how anytype.io is storing their graph at the edge.<p>The short pitch is: imagine if you had a structured graph of your personal data (private &amp; synchronized offline), we would be able to build tons of cross silo solutions. My first use case is to identify low frequency NERs so that i can have a personalized RSS reader.",
