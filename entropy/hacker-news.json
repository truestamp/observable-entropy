      "text": "I wrote a production system for a small winery 12 years ago which was well received and the software has been evolving to cover changes in the industry, however the winery has since grown to be the biggest in the country, and last month they have just bought another company with 3 more wineries and want to install the software in these too.<p>Despite my insistence they build their own development team or make succession plans they have tested the market rejected all other options and done neither.  I am a few years off retirement and find myself in a dilemma that I don&#x27;t need the money but can no longer work the crazy hours this sometimes needs, also due to the complexity of the system I dont have time to hire&#x2F;manage other staff, but I also cant let the winery down!<p>So I was thinking of selling&#x2F;partnering up with a bigger company but how do you sell your business when you are the business ?",
