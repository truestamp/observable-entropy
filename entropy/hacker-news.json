      "text": "Hi HN, as a person with back pain from working at a desk I started Movably to find a way to move and change postures all without interrupting my desk work or concentration.<p>The chair is smart, it lets you move easily, as often as every few minutes, between a set of postures over the course of a day. It works at standing height so it isn’t as disturbing as raising&#x2F;lowering a sit-stand desk or walking on a treadmill. Because your center of gravity maintains its relationship to the work surface it becomes almost automatic really quickly. And sitting is just a posture too, you can sit when you need to (just not too much!).<p>Here’s a video of how it works: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dC__YxuEGBU<p>We’d like more feedback.  We want to learn more about what types of usage&#x2F;posture patterns work best for a broader group of users and different kinds of desk work: coding, video editing, writing, gaming, etc. If you are a standing desk user interested in testing one of our chair prototypes for up to a week or two let us know here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;movably.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;Nyo8603J (the trial is free and we will arrange to deliver a chair)<p>Happy to answer any questions!\nThanks, Mark",
