      "text": "I live in the country and have one yard light. It&#x27;s on a timer and goes until 2 or 3 a.m. It used to be mercury discharge but years ago was switched to HP sodium (70 watt) which is far more efficient and also gives a very pleasant light for nighttime illumination. Sure, it has low CRI factor but it provides the light I need to accomplish any chores that need doing at night, like feeding my outdoor wood furnace, while not making the area seem like it&#x27;s daytime. The old mercury light did not provide any more illumination but used 150 watts of electricity. More importantly the light was way too harsh and daylight-like, just inappropriate for a night light. I might even switch to a 50-watt HPS bulb as the light is that efficient. The bulbs last for many years and are not expensive.<p>Driving on streets that are lighted with full spectrum LED lamps are similarly harsh and, in my opinion, unsettling. I guess it depends on what night lighting is for, to see what needs to be seen or see those things in daylight-quality illumination, with all its advantages and faults.<p>I just hope people consider all the angles before rushing into LED street lighting.",
