      "text": "When documenting my last project I came to the realization that all projects I have worked on have a very poor documentation of their data model. I believe that this leads to longer onboarding time and a lot of newscommer mistakes in the project (such adding new properties for something that exists somewhere else). Generally the data model is documented in the database &#x2F; ORM, but it generally describe the physical representation of the data in the database (name is a Varchar(128)) but not how&#x2F;for what such data are to be use (which is sometime complicate to understand on old project where knowledge has been lost and when naming is not consistent&#x2F;explicit).<p>It seems that recent ORM that allow you to describe your DB schema as code (like Prisma) allow you to add ‘comments’ on your Data model, but I feel it’s not enough.<p>I have look at the data modeling tooling but haven’t found satisfying solutions.<p>I missing something? How do you document your app data model?",
