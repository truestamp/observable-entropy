You can write your own converter by inheriting `aiotense.application.ports.converters.AbstractConverter`.\n- Need to cache the result? Write your own parser by inheriting `aiotense.application.ports.parsers.AbstractParser`.<p>aiotense has been designed with maximum flexibility, practicality and user friendliness in mind. I hope our project helped you or you were just interested in seeing it.",
