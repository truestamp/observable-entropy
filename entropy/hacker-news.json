Previously, our Conditions of Use set out an arbitration process for those disputes. Our updated Conditions of Use provides for dispute resolution by the courts.<p>Please visit https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;conditionsofuse to read our updated terms in full.<p>As always, your use of any Amazon service constitutes your agreement to our Conditions of Use.<p>Thank you,<p>Amazon</i><p>Did anyone know this was coming? This seems to be a big deal.<p>The relevant terms from the actual Conditions of Use:<p><i>DISPUTES<p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Amazon Service will be adjudicated in the state or Federal courts in King County, Washington, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in these courts. We each waive any right to a jury trial.</i><p>Is that legal for a terms of service to dictate what court hears a case? Can Amazon unilaterally prevent jury trials? This seems insane to me.",

We had a kid during 2020 and that plus the virus kept us working and indoors.<p>I took a week long vacation and feel great, but I’m having a ton of trouble getting back into the swing of things at work. I’m finding myself just staring more than working.<p>Any tips on how to get back into work again?",
