      "text": "I&#x27;ve made a couple of blogs for friends that are currently hosted on cheap VPSs, they are both classic Wordpress blogs with a few hundred MBs images.\nTo reduce maintenance and have more speed&#x2F;uptime&#x2F;security I wanted to move the workflow to a static blog hosted on Github Pages (assuming you can host hundreds of MBs there, the limit is 1GB afaik).\nThere seem to be so many ways to go about it, so I&#x27;m suffering from analysis paralysis: the workflow should be easy enough for my non-dev friends to update posts themselves without botching the blog..<p>How would you do it? I had a look at Pelican, Hugo and Lektor and I appreciate the &quot;admin panel&quot; in Lektor but I&#x27;m not an expert and you might have better ideas",
