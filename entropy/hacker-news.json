      "text": "Seems to me I could do the following:  stand up a web site where people can register and then buy the &quot;rights&quot; to an image on the site.<p>If people want to trade an image they might agree that A pays B $200.  I make A pay $230,  pay $200 to B,  pay $15 to the payment processor,  etc.<p>That updates the record in mysql or DynamoDB and now B has bragging rights that they own the image.  I am sure the cost of running that database conventionally is less than doing it on Etherium.<p>Why not?",
