Only after a few minutes did the guy realize the perplexity of the situation. How do you insure against a race condition in a public forum with no way to direct message?<p>Luckily, he nabbed the invite code, but it got me thinking about using PGP to provide a solution. This is meant to be a rough PoC and the UX is definitely not ready for the average Joe, but the functionality I&#x27;d like to think is there.<p>Btw, &quot;this page uses NO SERVER&quot; just means it&#x27;s static.
