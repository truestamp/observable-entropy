Very hard. Guess it&#x27;s due to security.<p>After some hours wasted I got it done. Time to transfer the file. Of course gmail does not send my email.\nFear not, I am smarter than that. Upload to Drive. Nope, does not work either. Weird.<p>Upload with facebook messenger maybe? Hmm they compress images like hell.\nThe other day fiverr was not loading orders for like a day. Wise.com turned chinese for no reason. Google cloud resets my functions to private randomly.<p>Am I losing my mind? Getting old? Too busy? Frustrated? Am I just a shitty developer? How do non techies cope?",
