      "text": "I am primarily concerned with app data.  I have many apps like messaging apps that have important private data such as contacts and message history that is difficult or impossible to export.  A big concern is if I lose my phone, there are some accounts that can only be recovered using the same phone number, which may be impossible if the  phone company refuses to issue another SIM card with the same number (a problem when traveling abroad).<p>So what do you guys do to get full (preferably offline) backups now that Android 12 has removed backup functionality from adb?  Is the only option to use a phone that can be rooted? (unfortunately not possible with my Samsung Fold 3 without disabling the camera).",
