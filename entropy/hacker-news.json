      "text": "www outline.com is offline&#x2F;unreachable since about 10 days. It is&#x2F;was(?) a very useful service to make some webpages more readable and (in some case) avoid the paywall. I also used it a lot of time to extract the &quot;reader view&quot; of some article to send it via email. But since 7-10 the website is down but domain looks okay. I&#x27;m also using a recursive DNS resolver so it&#x27;s not blocked via DNS from my ISP.<p>Someone know what&#x27;s going on? I haven&#x27;t found other info.<p>Thanks",

I&#x27;ll write a simple CMS so they can add&#x2F;remove images, which Image hosting service do you think is best for this task? AWS S3 seems too complicated to setup in the free tier, bbImage looks like an option, any suggestions very much appreciated, thanks!!!",
