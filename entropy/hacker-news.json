      "text": "One of my favorite pastimes is browsing the Web and collecting snippets of text into my pasteboard.<p>On iOS, I am often frustrated by the process of selecting and copying text. It is difficult to select text, and then the Copy menu doesn&#x27;t appear, etc.<p>Sometimes it can take an entire minute or two just to copy a paragraph.<p>Then there is the pasting... I select the textarea and watch the Paste menu appear, then disappear as the keyboard slides into view, followed by several more taps inside the field...<p>Select All seems to have been removed as a feature altogether at some point.<p>Is there a browser out there that will, for example, show me just the main text segments from a page and let me toggle-select them, and then copy?<p>Any other ideas for my use cases are also welcome, in case I&#x27;m creating an XY problem here.",

      "text": "Ideally, would love something along the lines of Netscape Navigator browser&#x27;s &quot;Composer&quot; which has been duplicated in SeaMonkey ... but without having to micro-manage things like cell border widths and such.<p>The closest thing found so far is Carrd, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to allow for the flexibility of Composer.<p>Basically, need something that effortlessly allows a &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;-type approach to having a single, static landing page with the ability to add a little bit of text, an image or two initially, and the ability to maybe add more images on the landing page OR have a separate &quot;Partners&quot; page where corporate logos and maybe some contact info for a key person could be added.<p>Pretty much everything so far is overkill, insists on flashy &quot;pre-built templates&quot; that take away from the core presentation and don&#x27;t even allow for the &quot;look-and-feel&quot; desired.<p>At the same time, hiring a web dev, even on outsourcing sites, seems a bit too much PLUS maintaining control of all aspects of the site would be crucial for security purposes.<p>Thought about Facebook or Reddit which WOULD allow for group communications, but have had horrible experiences with both where previous accounts&#x2F;subreddits were banned &quot;by accident&quot; for technical reasons that the companies agreed were in error, and yet have inexplicably failed to be of assistance in retrieving the data lost, despite agreeing that the accounts&#x2F;subreddits were flagged &quot;by mistake&quot; via automated processes they developed but refuse to take responsibility for (&quot;It&#x27;s not OUR fault, &quot;the Ai&quot; did that&quot; ...)<p>Anyone have any ideas?<p>I&#x27;ve looked at &quot;landing page&quot; services, but again it seems like overkill with too many things that have nothing to do with what this project is about, and again most of them seem to have this insistence on dime-a-dozen &quot;templates&quot; that clutter the presentation and have nothing to do with what is actually desired.<p>tl;dr: Looking for a simple WYSIWG web-based service that can (preferably automatically, linked with domain name creation&#x2F;integration&#x2F;management) publish a 1-2 page landing site with the ability to edit minimum text and flexibly add photos of partner companies as they sign up.<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",
