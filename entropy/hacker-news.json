Leaving aside aspects such as reparability and upgradability, it is a solid machine for everyday coding.<p>However, my biggest concern is the excessive SSD usage.<p>M1 users, what is your experience with the machine?

I would like to get one, but I do not want to deal with data corruption during the lifespan of the machine (I suppose four years is a conservative duration).<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;23&#x2F;m1-mac-users-report-excessive-ssd-usage-potentially-affecting-the-components-lifespan&#x2F;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.macrumors.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;m1-air-excessive-ssd-writing.2291694&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;338844&#x2F;how-worried-should-you-be-about-your-m1-macs-ssd-lifespan.html",
