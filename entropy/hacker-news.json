      "text": "Today, with Robinhood, Webull, and etc there are many people who have their own blockage account and they manage it themselves. Many times they want to buty a new stock or sell some of what they have to buy another. NOTE: THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT TO BUY!!! THEY ALREADY MADE THAT DECISION. However, they don&#x27;t know what to sell and when to sell to minimize the tax penalty while mitt some specific criteria. for instance the new stock be 50% of the portfolio or other criteria.<p>To see if this is a problem I created a questionnaire. It takes about four minutes to fill it. Would be great if you can help me to have a better picture of the problem.<p>Thanks.<p>here is the link:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.surveymonkey.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;TS93GD5",
