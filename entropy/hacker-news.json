      "text": "Hey HN: Kaveh here, the founder of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usage.ai&#x2F;<p>We help companies drive down AWS EC2 spend. Why? Because the way it&#x27;s done now is a pain. DevOps engineers end up becoming cloud accountants trying to figure out what commitments are expiring soon and how much they&#x27;re saving.<p>Previous to founding Usage, I worked on high-performance computing research at JP Morgan Chase and as a software engineer at a number of medium-sized startups.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: We are typically brought in by a DevOps manager to cut AWS EC2 costs. The app is entirely self-service and the savings are generated automatically, typically we do this live on a call. On average, we reduce AWS EC2 spend by 57% for 5 minutes of work.<p>To reduce by ~57%, we don&#x27;t touch the instances, require any code change, or change the performance of your instances. We buy Reserved Instances on your behalf (a billing layer change only) and bundle them with guaranteed buyback. So you get the steep 57% savings of 3-year no-upfront RIs with none of the commitment (you can sell them back to us anytime after 30 days).<p>We make money off a 20% Savings Fee. Happy to chat directly kaveh@usage.ai<p>Have you experienced any issues with managing your company or organization&#x27;s AWS expenses? We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and ideas!",
