      "text": "Hello HN Community!<p>I’m Gaurav Sharma, founder, and CEO of SaaS Labs, a multi-product platform for sales and support reps.<p>You may recognize us from our flagship product JustCall, the modern cloud phone &amp; workflow automation system for sales and support teams. Now after helping 6000+ businesses to handle tens of millions of calls using our tech, we’re onto the next big challenge. Reinventing how people look at Sales Training.<p>Let&#x27;s face it; most sales training right now is pretty terrible. From mock pitches to roleplaying calls, it takes hours and hours from your sales leader’s time and there’s no way to judge whether your trainees are really ‘getting it’.<p>That’s why we created Dialworks, your go-to platform to help teams #GetSalesReady. Some early users are calling it “Uber of Sales Training”.<p>Ok, I know what you&#x27;re thinking. &quot;Another sales platform? Really?&quot; I get it. Sales platforms are a dime a dozen nowadays. But hear me out.<p>We&#x27;ve been there: you have a new team of sales reps, and you have to get them trained and ready to go before the end of the month. That means training sessions for days on end. That means hours of reviewing their pitches, working through their objections, and figuring out how they can improve—all while still running your business! We don&#x27;t think it should be so hard or expensive to train your sales team when it&#x27;s crucial to your company&#x27;s performance.<p>We created Dialworks because we believe that training should be fast, affordable and simulate real world selling as closely as possible.<p>With Dialworks, we can help get your team ‘Battle Tested’ with real-world practice.<p>Simply set up a training campaign and your team get’s to call and practice their pitching skills with real people in real world settings. \nThese calls are recorded and provided feedback upon to tell trainees which parts of the pitch work well and which parts don’t. \nAll of this on autopilot, without taking up hours of your senior sales team.\nGet an insight into real world performance of your reps for training<p>It takes all the guesswork and hard work out of ramping up new sales reps.<p>Book your demo now and get $2000 credits: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dialworks.io&#x2F;demo",
