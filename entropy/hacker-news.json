      "text": "Hook is an information retrieval tool for macOS that supplies &amp; resolves links &amp; bookmarks to all kinds of info, to minimize what Seth Godin recently called &quot;Mode Switching&quot;.<p>This week, we @ CogSci Apps Corp. released Hook 3.2 for Mac, adding<p>- support for Instapaper + GoodLinks (Hook already supported Pinboard); \n- simultaneous deep linking and quoting of PDF text; \n- new integrations with Merlin Project, Notion and Zoom; \n- etc.<p>See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hookproductivity.com&#x2F;<p>Hook has a free 30-day trial and a free its Lite mode.<p># Product description<p>Hook features a nimble keyboarder-friendly popup window resembling Spotlight® and launchers (Alfred, LaunchBar). In contrast, however, Hook is context-aware ; it generates and leverages information networks.<p>How? Bring Hook&#x27;s context window up on a selected or open file, email, task, or almost any item in almost any Mac app, and it will allow you to `Copy Link` to the item (⌘C).<p>This provides a uniform gesture that works not only across browsers (no plugin&#x2F;extension required) but in any app that is truly linkable ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hookproductivity.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;integration&#x2F;data-linkability-and-why-it-matters&#x2F;)<p>The scheme of the URL  returned by Hook&#x27;s `Copy Link` (⌘C) command for the given foreground app is determined a priori as follows.  When possible, the scheme is standard (eg, https). Otherwise if the app has its own URL scheme, Hook will normally use it (e.g., `x-devonthink-item:` URL or omnifocus:); otherwise, if possible Hook will supply a link with its own scheme + subscheme. Eg, Hook provides a `hook:&#x2F;&#x2F;file&#x2F;` URL for the open or selected Finder file, which unlike `file:&#x2F;&#x2F;` URL works even if you move the file (eg, offload a Git or Dropbox folder &amp; remount it elsewhere).  `hook:&#x2F;&#x2F;file&#x2F;` links can be shared between users (assuming the recipient has the same file). Hook&#x27;s `hook:&#x2F;&#x2F;email&#x2F;` URLs include the RFC-5322 compliant email ID; so they work across compliant email apps, determined by the Hook mail preference set by whoever activates the link.<p>Hook also can generate bidirectional links (&quot;hooks&quot;) to&#x2F;from the foreground app&#x27;s current item (the &quot;context&quot;). Hook&#x27;s solution predates and is much more general &amp; versatile than macOS 12 Quick Note.<p>Hook also enables one to create `.hook` files for the currently open item. More general and robust than aliases and .weblocs, and they are plain text (markdown).<p>Because `Copy Link` is a highly discriminative signal of future information relevance, Hook internally bookmarks what you link, optionally to Pinboard, Instapaper &amp;&#x2F;or GoodLinks.<p>Hook also enables deep PDF linking across multiple apps. Select text in a &quot;linkable&quot; PDF app, use Hook&#x27;s context-sensitive `Copy Link`: get a link to the specific location in that file. You or your recipient can open it with any compliant PDF app.<p>See [our notes on interoperability](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hookproductivity.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;openness&#x2F;). Eg Hook has an API. And you can view and edit its &quot;integration scripts&quot;.<p>Hook can&#x27;t adequately be pigeon-holed in terms of current products. So it takes a few minutes of focused attention to get one&#x27;s head wrapped around it. To a first approximation, you can think of Hook as _privately_ and nimbly provisioning the &quot;last mile&quot; beyond the web, bidirectionally linking your Mac&#x27;s local resources to each other, to the cloud and the web (you can also webpages, of course). Hook overcomes the silo-ness of apps (e.g., connecting e-mail messages to tasks and files) without forcing you to use a particular multi-function suite (like Evernote or Notion).<p>Long ago, I was an at-founding employee of Tundra Semiconductors, which made hardware bus bridges between disparate CPUs&#x2F;buses. That gave me the idea for Hook, a connector of user-facing software resources.<p>And yes, a companion for iPhone&amp;iPad is coming (not a replacement).<p>CogSci Apps Corp. is a privately held Canadian company of which I am co-founder. I&#x27;m co-inventor of Hook.",
