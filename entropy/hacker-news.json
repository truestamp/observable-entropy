      "text": "As a bit of background for the question: viewing and understanding diffs and patches is important for code review, and in general it&#x27;s good when those diffs are small (I&#x27;ve heard 300 lines suggested in the past as a reasonable upper limit).<p>But sometimes it&#x27;s necessary to make changes (often find-and-replace-style) that affect thousands or more lines or even files at the same time.<p>Does anyone know of any tools that can automatically &#x27;summarize&#x27; those repeat changes rather than displaying them in-repeat for each affected file site?<p>(there are some tricky challenges here, and perhaps a language&#x2F;editing style that encodes search-and-replace into the diff&#x2F;patch process would make this much easier.. even so, I&#x27;d figure it&#x27;s worth asking.  it feels like it must be a situation that a lot of programmers and reviewers encounter?)",
