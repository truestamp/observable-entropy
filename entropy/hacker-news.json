      "text": "We&#x27;re a FinTech startup (deposits, pre-paid card, mortgages, investments), based out of Toronto, and looking for a CTO. Would prefer local, but open to remote (prefer EST time zone and someone in Canada but open to everyone).<p>The company is 4 years in, and are on the verge of some really big things over the next few months. Currently we are 5 people with an outsourced development team that we need to replace. This would be the first hire in that process with the goal of growing the product development team to maybe 6 over the next year.<p>We just closed our SAFE round, and have enough runway for the next 18-months (assuming no revenue, but we make revenue that&#x27;s growing YOY) - we are pretty lean. Have a VC lined up for a Series A later this year.<p>Our stack is Python&#x2F;Django&#x2F;React&#x2F;AWS.<p>Trying to stay stealth with this post, so drop your email into a comment, and I&#x27;ll send you a note with the complete job listing as soon as possible.<p>Thanks!",
