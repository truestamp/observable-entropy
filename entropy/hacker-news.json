In between, they reduced the offer twice, and the offer on paper was 15% lower than the prior verbal offer. At no point did I negotiate.

Now that I received the formal offer, I felt like I had to walk away with dignity and just declined.<p>It was with a mid-tier cryptocurrency exchange. I knew their culture was terrible since the NYT recently covered them, so I can’t say I was surprised.<p>It appears the balance of power has shifted back to employers.",
