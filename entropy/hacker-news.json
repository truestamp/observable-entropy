      "text": "Would love to hear about people&#x27;s favourite, <i>affordable</i> log analysis platform!<p>At my current company we use GCP Logging - it&#x27;s cheap, but ad-hoc log analysis is very awkward. i.e. you can filter to logs easily, but doing &quot;group by&#x2F;count&quot; type things is painful, not something you can easily do ad-hoc. You basically have to export the logs to BigQuery, or create metrics from the logs (which helps going-forwards, but isn&#x27;t good for analyzing past logs where you lack existing metrics). Overall, doesn&#x27;t really fit our needs for flexible, ad-hoc log analysis.<p>At my past company, we used Sumo Logic. It was amazing - they have their own query language that&#x27;s similar to SQL, with incredible text processing capabilities, so good at ad-hoc log analysis. However ... it&#x27;s VERY expensive. My current company is a smaller startup, with a lot of logs, and it&#x27;s simply not in our price range.<p>Would love to find something similar to Sumo Logic, but much cheaper.",
