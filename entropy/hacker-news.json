      "text": "This is something that bugs me a little about Hacker News. It&#x27;s a very minor issue, but I&#x27;m bringing it up because it&#x27;s Hacker News.<p>Let&#x27;s say I make a comment, and it has 14 upvotes. That does not mean 14 people saw it and liked it, it means 13 people did. A new submission with 2,834 upvotes only had 2,833 people who actually upvoted it. I know that there are downvotes which make things not a perfect match, but I don&#x27;t think that affects my view.<p>In my ideal world, every submission and comment would start at 0. And they&#x27;d either go up or down from there.<p>This would also be adjusted in the &quot;fading&quot; for downvoted comments, with them starting to fade at -2 instead of -1.",

      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I am thinking of making a dedicated server box for your home that runs self-hosted apps. \nWait, you say... isn&#x27;t that just a computer running Ubuntu? Yes, but hear me out --<p>The idea would be to have a physical box (that you can see &amp; trust) in your living room. \nInstalling a self-hosted app (such as Peertube, Mastodon, email, etc.) takes one click. \nAll the Docker stuff will happen automatically. DNS&#x2F;domain configuration will happen automatically. \nAnd suddenly you have your own little self-hosted universe without trusting any external EC2&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;etc. \n(There are some constraints on traffic; if you host a popular PeerTube your ISP might get a bit sad. \nThat can be resolved later.)<p>All of this is possible &amp; relatively easy to do now. It&#x27;s just schleppy. And it breaks a lot.<p>If I made something that &quot;just worked&quot;, would you buy it?",
