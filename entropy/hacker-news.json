I don&#x27;t want the keystrokes I type in private (i.e. not posts to Facebook) to determine my Social Credit Score.<p>So, it&#x27;s time to say Sayonara Apple, and welcome in the Purism Librem Mini to my service. Many years may you reign, and I truly hope you have as few bugs as your predecessor (my Mac mini never faltered, only slowed down as Apple&#x27;s planned &#x2F; programmed obsolescence kicked in).<p>And Tim, if you&#x27;re reading this, please stop what you&#x27;re doing. You&#x27;re taking our beloved company, and the world, in the wrong direction.",
