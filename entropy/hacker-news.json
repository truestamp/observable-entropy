      "text": "I&#x27;m on pytorch hub, which is a site where you can download ML models others have build and trained. Some of the organizations that have models on there I&#x27;ve never heard of, and have model pages that look more like a page for some dodgy amazon brand you&#x27;ve never heard of - it hotel my radar up a bit. My question is, has anyone encountered this as an attack vector before, distributing a pytorch (or I assume TF) model that runs arbitrary code, and having it do something malicious? Some of these have a lot of users and I doubt many are taking the time to review what they are actually running. Let me know if I can clarify, thanks!",
