      "text": "After reading the popular post today about people&#x27;s side projects, I&#x27;m thinking about my current &quot;great idea!&quot;.  While I&#x27;m convinced that my idea would be successful, I lack the expertise of manufacturing and business necessary to do this alone.<p>Q1: For those of us not living in startup hotspots, how do you find partners and experts to work with?<p>Q2: How do you prevent the expert&#x2F;partner from taking your idea and building it themselves, without you?<p>In my case, I need to manufacture something where the dimensional details will vary for every unit.  3D printing could be the solution, or perhaps there&#x27;s a good way to modularize and use modern manufacturing to assemble premade components to result in the same custom solution.<p>There are probably many possibilities, many of which would not be suitable or economical; but that knowledge is beyond me, so I need help!",
