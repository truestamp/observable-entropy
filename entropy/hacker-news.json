Eventually down the line if I get investment can I retroactively take equity away from my self and then set up a vesting schedule to satisfy an investor?<p>Thanks in advance everyone !",

I have no experience in telecoms, but I&#x27;m an entrepreneur and I enjoy learning.<p>If you are in the industry, I would love any guidance you could provide to help a newbie get started. Is it feasible to challenge them? What resources should I look into to get started? Why will it be difficult and where am I most likely to fail?<p>Thanks! :)",
