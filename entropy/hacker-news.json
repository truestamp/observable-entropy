It is a place which enables you, as a developer, to distribute, and, as a user, to get to know, create an account, buy and download any application, giving you, at the same time, a choice of where you can do that.<p>This way, implementing such a general and ultimate model, the alternative neither compete with app stores, using them as its element, not enemies, nor with apps&#x27;s producers, in fact encouraging users both to visit their website and buy apps from there.",
