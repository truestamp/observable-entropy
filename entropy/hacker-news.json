      "text": "I really enjoy it when I see programmers with a deranged disregard for aesthetics in the name of efficiency or productivity. Some of my favorited examples from my own experience:<p>- An <i>extremely</i> productive, like, 100x senior engineer I know works on a stock Ubuntu box with the default desktop wallpaper and an un-customized IntelliJ IDE and when he opens an IDE window he doesn&#x27;t even full screen or center it. Just blasting code in an un-centered 68% width IDE.<p>- The smartest person I know (like, easily) uses the tcsh shell, the nvi editor, and the twm or ratpoision window manager, all ancient, unmaintained tools. I think they were the state of the art when he started using Unix and he never bothered switching.<p>- I saw a very clever bitcoin developer just set `contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;` on an HTML element and use it as a text editor, I think because he already had the window open.<p>- Another developer I know with insane quality standards just names things &quot;foo&quot; when he can&#x27;t think of a name for things, to the point where we worked on a project together for a month in a repo called &quot;foo&quot; until we came up with a name.<p>What are some good examples you&#x27;ve witnessed?",
