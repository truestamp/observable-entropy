      "text": "Hey everyone, my name is Michael. After working in the data space for several years I realized that it was still a huge gap in the marketing analytics market. Marketers weren’t taking their data to its full advantage. Missing on many growth opportunities.<p>In my personal case, I was tired of wasting time on dashboards and graphics. I wanted a straightforward way to understand everything that happens on my website so I can always make the most accurate decisions.<p>So, that&#x27;s why I made this platform called Narrative BI (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.narrative.bi&#x2F;) to give marketers the chance to leverage marketing analytics data. The app turns complex data into actionable narratives. This means anyone can understand their data. Even if they are complete beginners.<p>But it&#x27;s not only for beginners. Data experts can also save time in analyzing data thanks to the narratives the platform automatically generates.<p>At the moment it’s integrating with UA and GA4 and I will be releasing the Google Ads and Facebook Ads integrations in the next few months.<p>You can try it out for free and give your feedback or roast it in the comments section. Just connect your UA or GA4 account and you&#x27;ll start getting narratives in 5 minutes.",

      "text": "Code review is important, but I find it&#x27;s often a momentum-killer. A few things can happen after you open a PR:<p>* Nobody reviews it for days because everyone is busy working on their own stuff. This is likely because code review isn&#x27;t as rewarded as pushing code (&quot;I implemented X&quot; sounds better in a standup than &quot;I reviewed a bunch of PRs yesterday&quot;).<p>* You end up in an endless back and forth with one or more reviewers (e.g. push-review-fix-push-review-fix-push-review...). If this occurs over the course of days, the &quot;fix&quot; portion becomes an interruption where you have to remember the context of the changes, make the changes, then submit them.<p>These are the two instances I can think of off the top of my head, but if you have other examples and strategies for combating them, I&#x27;d love to hear them.",
