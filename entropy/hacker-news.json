      "text": "I&#x27;m very interested in what types of interesting data structures are out there HN. Totally your preference.<p>I&#x27;ll start: bloom filters. Lets you test if a value is definitely NOT in a list of pre-stored values (or POSSIBLY in a list - with adjustable probability that influences storage of the values.)<p>Good use-case: routing. Say you have a list of 1 million IPs that are black listed. A trivial algorithm would be to compare every element of the set with a given IP. The time complexity grows with the number of elements. Not so with a bloom filter! A bloom filter is one of the few data structures whose time complexity does not grow with the number of elements due to the &#x27;keys&#x27; not needing to be stored (&#x27;search&#x27; and &#x27;insert&#x27; is based on the number of hash functions.)<p>Bonus section: Golomb Coded Sets are similar to bloom filters but the storage space is much smaller. Worse performance though.",
