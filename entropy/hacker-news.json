      "text": "I run a weekly podcast in which I interview professors to provide the background to and the history behind current news. As a point of clarification, we don&#x27;t do history for its own sake. We are NOT a history podcast. We only do the history and background to subjects that are in the news. The name of our podcast is ThePeel.news, which you can find on Apple, Spotify and Google podcasts, and also on our site at www.ThePeel.news<p>Our guests are distinguished professors, including those that are nationally recognized in their fields.<p>This project started out as a labor of love for me, but it has morphed into a full time commitment. Finding potential guests and persuading them to come on the show takes time (prominent professors are extremely busy).<p>So I am looking for help to promote my podcast. My project is not a startup (not yet anyway). So we don&#x27;t have any funding. I have a tiny budget and would appreciate any input regarding how to get some quality help in promoting this project.<p>Thanks very much in advance.",
