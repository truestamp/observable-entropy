I looked at Bloomberg un-subscription process, and it seems they also require you to chat with the customer service about it.<p>Ideally I would like to subscribe (and unsubscribe) directly (i.e. not through, say, iTunes).<p>If you have any good experiences with unsubscribing at will, please share.",
