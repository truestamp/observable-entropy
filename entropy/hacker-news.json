      "text": "I want to give my kids (8 and 9) a computer that they can use on their own. I want them to be able to use productivity software, listen to music on Spotify, watch age appropriate shows on Disney plus, access certain educational websites, etc.<p>What I don&#x27;t want is them to have access to arbitrary websites.<p>I&#x27;ve tried using macOS built-in screentime feature, but it&#x27;s completely useless. I can&#x27;t block Safari, and when I try using the whitelist mode for web content restrictions, Spotify stops working.<p>I would really like to give my kids a computer they can use without supervision, but not with the whole internet accessible.",
