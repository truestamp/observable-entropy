      "text": "I’m close to 40 and I anecdotally seem to be getting far more easily distracted than I remember being years ago. Today I went to the door to walk my dogs, thought I would get a baby wipe to clean off my shoes, saw that my walls needed to get scrubbed, and then spent 2 hours cleaning my walls. Even the slightest distraction can make me completely forget what I was thinking about if I’m not super focused on what I’m doing. It seems to me like becoming a Dad 5 years ago was a big catalyst as it upended all of my coping mechanism. I’m not sure if I haven’t recovered or if age might be a factor here. Anyways, ADHD seems to be a common topic here and I’m curious if other folks have had similar experiences?",
