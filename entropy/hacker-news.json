      "text": "I have noticed that a lot of simple tasks are becoming more difficult to do with smartphones. For example in Android, it&#x27;s basically impossible to set a countdown timer if the phone is locked without using a voice assistant. Apple might have implemented this specific feature better by allowing users to access the timer through the Control Center. However, iOS&#x27;s calculator is just too cumbersome too use due its lack of features and lack of decent alternatives. What are your thoughts?",
