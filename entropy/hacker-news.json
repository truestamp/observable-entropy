      "text": "I was talking crypto with my friend yesterday, and I mentioned that in a Proof of Stake system, it&#x27;s much more energy efficient because only a small randomly selected subset of miners verifies each transaction, so they aren&#x27;t all solving crypto problems to participate.<p>He then asked me what the random selection algorithm is that maintains security with possible bad actors, and I didn&#x27;t know.<p>I tried looking it up but I&#x27;m failing to find the details, everything just says &quot;they are randomly selected with a secure algorithm&quot;.  Can anyone tell me what the algorithm is?  I know (think?) that it&#x27;s a variation on Byzantine fault tolerance, but I can&#x27;t find the details.<p>Thanks!",
