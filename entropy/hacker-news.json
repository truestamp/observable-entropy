      "text": "Given the events of the past 24 hours I couldn&#x27;t resist, but to recall the large support on multiple stories here on HN in favor of creating nuclear power plants. The largest nuclear plant almost got destroyed in fighting between the two sides in Ukraine. We are lucky only the administrative building got hit and not the actual radioactive material. It would be no less disastrous than Chernobyl if that did happen. Having more nuclear plants means more likelihood of an irreversible damage to a part of earth.<p>In effect, we&#x27;re saying in event of a regional conflict we&#x27;re ok with having large of parts of earth becoming inhabitable for centuries.<p>Why are we supporting the creation of nuclear power plants?",
