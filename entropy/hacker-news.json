      "text": "I asked in writing to be unsubscribed and this was ignored. So the next time I got email from this thing, I reported the email as spam and Gmail gave me a drop-down menu with the option to &quot;report spam and unsubscribe&quot; so I did that. I got another email from the same thing and again &quot;reported spam and unsubscribed.&quot;<p>This morning I decided to check how to report abuse for the service in question. Their instructions said to forward the email in question to their abuse address.<p>I did that with an explanation of the situation. And I promptly got a &quot;support ticket&quot; reply but I couldn&#x27;t find my sent email in my outbox.<p>I found it in my spam folder and Gmail was telling me I had reported my outgoing email as spam.<p>So I clicked &quot;this is not spam&quot; so I could have a record of the outgoing email. And it removed BOTH emails from my spam folder.<p>This seems not right. I want the incoming email listed as spam because it is.<p>But why would you list my outgoing forwarded email as spam just because I forwarded it from the spam folder?\nAnd why can&#x27;t I uncouple the emails?<p>I don&#x27;t follow the logic here at all.",
