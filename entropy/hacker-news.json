      "text": "Hi HN,<p>A simple Wordpress website and server I manage has been suffering a DDOS recently, and my attempts to combat it via fail2ban failed, so I&#x27;ve ended up using Cloudflare. Putting a huge centralised service in between the website and its readers feels like a privacy failure to me.<p>It&#x27;s a simple website hosted on a physical server. The DDOS attack is trying to brute force &#x2F;xmlrpc.php and &#x2F;wp-login.php, so I&#x27;d blocked all access to xmlrpc.php in nginx, jailed any ips who requested it in fail2ban, and rate limited access to &#x2F;wp-login.php. But still endless requests to both are being made at numerous times a second from an endless series of ips, crashing the server on a daily basis. Now I&#x27;ve got Cloudflare in the way I&#x27;m hoping to turn away to buggers before they reach the server. But  is there no decentralised alternative?",
