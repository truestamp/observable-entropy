      "text": "As I write this post, my neighbors from above, probably college students, are having a party of their lifetime, laughing, kicking and screaming. I&#x27;m not even mad at them, just full of envy.<p>The last time I had fun like this was in college. I was broke, renting a big flat with a bunch of roommates, but young, healthy, and full of enthusiasm (and booze). Finding friends in my teens and 20s was as easy as going out literally anywhere.<p>When I went to work work, I thought my life would only get better. I worked from home, and I was paid so well, that I kept pushing overtime because if felt too good to last. I made a good career, but in the process, quickly drifted off into a complete isolation.<p>These days I still either work from home, or at best with a bunch of other devs in a mostly empty office. I tried to meet new people at hobbies and dance lessons, but guess what - they&#x27;re all full of lonely developers and other socially awkward people - short guys looking for girlfriends, unattractive&#x2F;aging women looking for husbands, etc.<p>All the &quot;normal&quot; people I knew in the past are now changing diapers and working to pay off their mortgages, which I guess is a kind of consolation. Still, I&#x27;m only in my 30s, and it feels like my life is pretty much done. Doing things by myself is boring and depressing, and a getting into a group of &quot;normal&quot; friends, of both genders, to hang out and laugh with, seems like an impossible goal.<p>In case someone has any advice beyond finding a hobby, going to therapy, approaching random strangers, it would be appreciated. Quitting the job is not out of question, although I don&#x27;t have any other skills besides coding, so it&#x27;d be a major financial hit.<p>Otherwise, maybe someone will at least take this as a cautionary tale to cultivate your social groups while you&#x27;re young. Later it just gets exponentially harder to find them.",
