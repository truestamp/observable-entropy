I tried logging into the Android app and it popped up an error message with a phone number to call. The phone number lead me to a spam line trying to sell me random products like insecticides, asking for my personal information, etc.<p>Wonder if we&#x27;ll see this in the news?<p>EDIT: Their login page now leads to a new page stating technical difficulties. The app no longer shows the error from before. It just says that it&#x27;s offline.",
