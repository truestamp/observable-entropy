      "text": "I&#x27;ve been in IT for close to a decade now and I&#x27;m trying to make a move into full time Cloud Consulting - I&#x27;ve done this sort of thing on and off over the years and have a fair amount of experience with all the big 3 cloud vendors.<p>Ever since the pandemic started my work had mostly devolved into endless meetings, general planning and very little coding. I&#x27;ve no idea what is happening with AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;GCP these days and I wanted opinions on a few things<p>1. I don&#x27;t want a list of pros and cons but if you had to pick a vendor today, which one would you go with and why?<p>2. Everytime I&#x27;d worked with Azure (from ~2016 to ~2019) there was always some PITA or the other and it was annoying. Is it still that way?<p>3. Folks who do consulting, Do you pick a solid vendor and then go with it or pick something that is full of weird gotchas and troubles and demand a higher price for that very reason?<p>4. People who&#x27;ve had first hand experience with GCP, Is it still &quot;that&quot; 3rd option or is it a solid contender against AWS and Azure?<p>5.I mostly work with small companies(5 to 50 employees) and some of them are lift and shift and some of them are optimising existing infra, and I was hoping if there were any suggestions on things I should think of when it comes to the Cloud keeping the company size in mind<p>On phone so apologies for the formatting but I&#x27;m curious on what y&#x27;all have to say.<p>Thanks and have a nice day &#x2F; night :)",
