      "text": "After many years of using Google Chrome I switched to Firefox due to privacy concerns. Overall I&#x27;ve loved the experience so far, but there&#x27;s one thing that bugs me: the suggestions. Firefox seems to be unable to make a sensible use of my browsing history. It suggests urls I visit only very rarely, or sometimes even suggests things I&#x27;ve never visited (I read some time ago that they would start providing sponsored suggestions). For example, it&#x27;s completely clueless about my Reddit browsing habits. The only subreddit I visit most of the time is r&#x2F;rust, but it doesn&#x27;t appear in FF&#x27;s suggestions. There&#x27;s only reddit main page, which I have never consciously visited. Sometimes the problem is the opposite - I want FF to suggest a url of a main page of, for example, a blog, but what I get are only some random posts I read on that blog a long time ago. Initially I thought that was a bug which would get fixed in a subsequent release, but this situation has been going on for at least a few months. Chrome&#x27;s suggestions were way more intuitive for me.<p>What&#x27;s your experience?",
