      "text": "Hey Folks,<p>I’ve been really annoyed with the search part of finding gifts.<p>It’s hard to use keyword search for something when it’s an “I’ll know it when I see it” kind of deal.<p>So I thought, what if we scraped&#x2F;indexed TONS of products and then just focused on removing the things we don’t want and then see what’s left to see if there’s anything cool?<p>I built it in Flutter so it&#x27;s both iOS and Android but it could be web too.<p>I’ve only just started the scraping&#x2F;tagging of products and if anyone has suggestions for bulk tagging images&#x2F;content I would love to hear them. That’s the current bottleneck.<p>Any feedback would be welcome!<p>cvanvlack AT gmail DOT com if you want to discuss 1-on-1.",
