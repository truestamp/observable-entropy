      "text": "Hi HN,<p>Where I work we get a laptop which we control quite a lot, except requirement to encrypt and backup the work data.<p>I do also a lot of open source and hobby coding on my free time, and I feel it would be very wasteful to have a separate laptop just for this.<p>Thus I have been thinking of different ways to keep work and private files on the same computer but separated.<p>It seems Qubes OS [1] could fulful this need, as well as provide good security.<p>On the other hand, Qubes seems to require a fair bit of time and energy to get set up and maintain. Thus, it struck me that a thin linux host system without many apps, and then keeping work and private projects and files in virtual machines in e.g. virtualbox, would provide similar basic benefits, without the technical savvyness needed by Qubes OS.<p>So I was wondering, does anybody have experience of any of the two setups, and could provide some pointers and feedback with pros and cons of them?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.qubes-os.org&#x2F;",
