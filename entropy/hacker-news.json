      "text": "I&#x27;ve been looking into redesigning a business website. I find the vast majority of business websites are similar, if not the same. The general structure I see is:<p>-Top navigation bar<p>-A picture or video panel with some sort of call to action<p>-A general overview of products&#x2F;solutions OR a process flow&#x2F;explanation<p>-Companies using the business offers<p>-Customer testimonials<p>-Footer<p>Between the call to action picture&#x2F;video panel and footer the sections can be any order. But, that&#x27;s it! Just about every business follows this template. The &#x27;standardization&#x27; of business based websites makes sense to the point that any given individual can navigate any business website that follows a similar structure. I believe that this is the case due to template based web development and perhaps the aforementioned intuitiveness brought forth by standardization. I am wondering if there are any unique websites out there. Sites that do not follow the traditional business template.",
