      "text": "I know it&#x27;s late for applications etc, but I was curious if this answer would qualify for the question &quot;Please tell us about the time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.&quot;<p>In 2016, before cross-country roaming data was a thing in Europe, I was working on a startup that would offer free wifi to Uber passengers to give them targeted ads to locations in London and products sold by the Driver.<p>In order to create a network of Uber Drivers that would join my platform, I developed a sort of script:\nEvery time I would ride in an Uber, I would adress their car (90% of the times, a Prius): &quot;Ah, a Prius, nice car man! It&#x27;s electric right?&quot; we&#x27;d talk about the benefits of EV, then from there to Tesla, then to autopilot and the alledged purchase of a fleet of Teslas by Uber that was in the papers at the time.<p>This would create a sense of scarcity in the Driver&#x27;s mind. Soon Uber might turn to self-driving cars and he might be out of a job. That&#x27;s when I&#x27;d start talking about Pablo Escolar, a San Francisco Uber Driver who was making $200&#x27;000 selling jewelry to his passengers (I can&#x27;t make this up, just google it), and the opportunity to do that himself. He could join my platform, put a wifi device in his car and eventually build a self sustaining online store that would be profitable when the robots take over.<p>With this script I built a network of over 100 Drivers, all ready to join my platform and advertise their products, local attractions and spas.",
