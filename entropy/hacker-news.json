      "text": "I’ve been asked recently by a buddy who’s kid (13) wants to learn programming but isn’t sure where is best to start. My gut feeling is something like Python might make the most sense, but wanted to ask the room.<p>Criteria I’m working on are:<p>1) Ease to get to “Hello World”.\n2) Kid-friendly, easily available learning resources.\n3) Low setup complexity.<p>It’s been so long since I’ve been there (VB6!) that it’s harder to know in 2022 what the right advice to give is for someone just starting out.<p>I also thought about steering them to HTML first, but I don’t think the open web as the same draw that it did for me back in the day.<p>What do you folks think?",
