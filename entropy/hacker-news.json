      "text": "The Amazon Video App in my smart TV has gotten noticeably laggy with every passing update for years, now taking over 20 seconds just to load the catalog. Browsing and pausing streams also seem to be annoyingly slow.<p>To add to this, my Kindle reader received an OTA update last week, and now it takes literal seconds to perform basic functions eg. to look up a word in a dictionary.<p>Have you also noticed your own Amazon apps&#x2F;devices getting worse and worse performance over time? If so, why do you think that is? Do they simply not care about performance as part of their testing cycles? Is it a conscious effort at Planned Obsolescence?",
