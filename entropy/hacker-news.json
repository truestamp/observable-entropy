This includes full bidirectional scroll sync and math support via KaTeX.<p>This also includes support for Codebraid, which can execute code blocks and inline code in Pandoc Markdown to embed code output. Code can be executed with Jupyter kernels or Codebraid&#x27;s own built-in code execution system.",
