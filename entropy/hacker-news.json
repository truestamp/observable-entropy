      "text": "My team and I are building something really interesting for homebuyers. Here in Ireland we have a problem with housing demand and the market is pretty hot. People need information around the bidding process like never before. We can provide this. The problems we solve can be seen the world over but Ireland is a particularly good &quot;petri dish&quot; to ensure good PM fit.\nWe have interest from lenders (B2B revenue) but investors, including our government&#x27;s investment vehicle, Enterprise Ireland, are quite shy of B2C risk. We have solid plans for getting users but as a result of the reluctance of investors to come in to the first round, we have pivoted to a more B2B start, helping property developers derisk construction finance in a manner so as to help us get users also. Hopefully things work out on our new path - it&#x27;s looking good.<p>However, I am curious. When presented with something disruptive as we are creating, with the benefits and obvious help for the consumer as I hope the reader will trust we bring, for the sake of discussion, are US based seed investors shy of B2C risk, even with verifiable interest from B2B revenue partners?<p>It feels like our second round will break records, but the first is very difficult (or has been before recent pivot at least.)<p>- We don&#x27;t have a requirement that we hit say 20% of buyers before we provide benefits to our users. We provide tangible benefits even to one user buying one home.\n- We can roll put in a manner so as to maximise the chances of having good user interactions on a per-property basis so as to give a good user experience from the get-go, even if not universally available in a market until user numbers are good\n- We have the team we need at this stage\n- We require small capital to get rolling and would attract significant grant funding, crowd-funding interest, etc",
