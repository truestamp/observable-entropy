      "text": "I’m Pranav, co-founder of Chatwoot (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chatwoot&#x2F;chatwoot), an open-source alternative to Intercom and Zendesk. What started as a passion project in 2019, gained a lot of momentum recently. This was possible because of all the contributions and love we got from the community.<p>We’ve created a page ([https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contributors.chatwoot.com&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;contributors.chatwoot.com&#x2F;)) to showcase our contributors’ work and give them a platform to share their contributions with the world.<p>We open-sourced this little project too. We’ve made our repo for other open-source projects to use it as a template and build their own contributions page. It is built on Next.js and runs on Github Pages with Github Actions updating the data regularly.<p>Check out the project and let us what you think about the project.<p>[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chatwoot&#x2F;contributors](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chatwoot&#x2F;contributors).",
