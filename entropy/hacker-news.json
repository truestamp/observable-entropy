      "text": "I work from home in the EU as a freelancer for a US startup.<p>A few days ago, an email came out of the blue, demanding that I install an &quot;agent&quot; from a company named &quot;Drata&quot;* on my laptop. The motivation is that my customer badly want a SOC 2 certification.<p>I have worked as a developer for more than 30 years. Tiny shops. Startups. Major league. I have never even heard about someone putting agents on developers laptops.<p>I&#x27;m pretty pissed off. So are the teams I work with.<p>Is this the new normal now?<p>Just for the record: I don&#x27;t have credentials to production systems, and I don&#x27;t work with production data. I just figure out to transform dreams into code, I write parts of that code, and then I fix it as needed.<p>* Drata (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drata.com&#x2F;about) is on a &quot;Mission to Help Build Trust Across the Internet&quot;. Their business model (in my case) seems to be to take money from companies to spy on their employees, and then they sell the employees private information to &quot;targeted advertising&quot;. When I confronted them about this, they replied: &quot;Feel free to reach out to your Drata administrator internally with concerns. Do note, that when your company contracted with Drata, any edits or redlines they provided will prevail for all employees of your company.&quot; - basically to just bend over and smile.",

      "text": "Biological control is a method of restricting the effects of harmful animals, pathogens, and plants using other useful organisms and changing this technique with \nbiological pest control methods. There are many pest control methods available to choose from, but they can be loosely grouped into three categories: classical techniques, augmentative techniques, and conservationist techniques. In each of these three techniques, a species or a group of species is deliberately released in a cropland area to serve as predators of another species, which is acting as a plague. The real variations come from the details. For full article go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indogulfbioag.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;an-introduction-to-the-main-techniques-of-biological-pest-control",
