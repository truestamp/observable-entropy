      "text": "I have been writing Fullstack javascript since 2018. I currently am an instructor at a Fullstack js bootcamp lecturing and engineering. I have experience with front end frameworks&#x2F;vanilla dom, node, express, postgres&#x2F;mongo, docker, aws (only ebs), ci&#x2F;cd, and am very comfortable in a Linux terminal. While I enjoy lecturing at the bootcamp, I’m looking for something with a more competitive salary.<p>I started applying for a role at Amazon and a recruiter reached out before I could even finish it on their portal. They are looking to interview me for an SDE-2 role. It looks like there’s quite the jump in average total comp at Amazon when going from SDE-2 to 3. I have been applying to senior roles for my applications to non-faang companies. Any insights as to whether or not it’s wise to push for sde3 here or just go through with the sde2 application would be greatly appreciated. Part of the background here is that many of the students at the bootcamp I work at get roles as sde2 at Amazon and similar, so I’m not sure if my desire for a senior role at a faang is justified even though I have more years of experience than them — could use some clarity here as I can’t determine if I’m over&#x2F;undervaluing myself&#x2F;experience.<p>Some other background is that I’m lucky enough to be a leetcode grinder for pleasure, but only really have what I would call a passing knowledge of system design. Happy to provide any other info that would be helpful here.<p>Side note: I’m not at all attached to my Amazon application, but it seems like the right vessel for me to use to make this post and better gauge where I’m at.<p>Thanks",
