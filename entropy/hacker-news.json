      "text": "I am a novelist by trade, but I began a coding project at the outset of the pandemic. My failed stint as a student of physics included courses in programming. I had a good base to work from when I discovered I needed tasks with a shorter feedback loop than writing to occupy my time. The project consists primarily of tools meant to make explicit the implicit boon that reading is to writers, as well as facilitate the rehearsal and dramaturgy of plays, all by providing a group of contributors and collaborators another place to turn to regularly as part of their methodology. Although it began amateurishly, I was happy to find that my efforts, often fraught, but always enthralling, gradually produced a product that is truly useful and a code base that is mostly clear and concise. I have also been working on other programs that help make my publishing, e-commerce, and retail operation easier to manage.<p>I am ready to hire a programmer, but I am at a loss as to how to do so. I think the project has potential, not great potential, but some potential, and I have capital to invest. I make use of GitHub, but I am inexpert in its intricacies. I am thinking about going to a nearby university and finding an undergraduate to hire. I suppose that I could hire foreign developers, but I would like to develop a relationship with a small team. It is important to me that the software is a creative enterprise and does not lose the esoteric motivation that is literature. Do I need a contract out of the gate? Could I begin a working relationship without too much formality, or is that a bad idea? How do I hire my first developer?",
