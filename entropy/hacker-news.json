      "text": "I am working with a small team of people on a highly optimized GPU-based parallelized shortest path algorithm.  AWS accounts are not by default allowed to use GPU instances, so you must request them.  During the week-long approval process for that, they said that the card that one of my partners put on the account was not acceptable for whatever reason (despite that their system said it had been validated), so I put my own card on it.  After a week of going in circles with them, we were finally able to get approved to spend a whopping 75 cents per hour on a GPU instance.<p>Less than 24 hours after starting the instance, I received an email from AWS.  The card I added to our team AWS account was also on my personal Amazon account, which is how they found my email address.  They said that they believed my card had been stolen and fraudulently added to an AWS account, and that they had proactively suspended the AWS account.  The email also said that if it was actually authorized, to simply reply to the email and the account would be reinstated.<p>I replied within 15 minutes of that email saying that it was authorized and to reinstate the account.  I have replied several times since then, as I have received no reply nearly 24 hours later, and the AWS account is still suspended.<p>Does anyone have a good way of getting ahold of these people?",

      "text": "In another thread [0] I commented on the moderation practice of Shadowbanning. But I wonder to what extent there are even more insidious methods, which I coined &quot;shadow suppression&quot;?<p>Say, if instead of an all-out shadow ban a moderator (or automated scripts, for that matter) would tweak some algorithmic parameters that instruct the platform AI to limit someone&#x27;s freedom of speech in very specific ways.<p>Just like a person based on their PII and content can be accurately targeted by ads, they can be accurately singled out and subtly limited in the amount of influence they can have on the platform.<p>Unlike a shadow ban this may never be noticed. A person&#x27;s non-controversial opinion may pass through, while their political statements are directed to a small echo chamber of other people. They will never reach the audience they are intended for.<p>The possibilities for shadow suppression are limitless. Without algorithmic transparency how do we even know how far such practices are applied?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28343848",
