      "text": "I&#x27;d like to start a consultancy focused on automating &#x2F; streamlining operational inefficiencies in small&#x2F;med sized businesses. I&#x27;ve learned through the years at various jobs that I&#x27;m good at automating these type of things, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t use those as part of my portfolio since the projects are not able to be discussed publicly.<p>What I&#x27;m offering:<p>Do you have a process in your business that requires a lot of manual back-and-forth between humans? For example - when an order is created, I have to update a spread sheet, reach out to my vendor, submit the order, buy a postage label, and send the customer an email update with the tracking information. Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for processes that depend upon the coordination of multiple people working on a repetitive process. Anything from order fulfillment, landlord maintenance requests, to customer onboarding processes.<p>I&#x27;m not charging anything. This is just me putting in the work to build up a portfolio of examples I can use for my consultancy. If we do launch an automated version of your process, I may just ask that you pay for the hosting costs (like $10-$20 max) per month.",
