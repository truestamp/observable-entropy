      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to scale OpenSustain.tech, which is essentially a awesome list for open climate and sustainability projects, into a central platform for data, software, and knowledge in the field. After about 16 months, we have managed to capture a large part of the active open source projects in this field. Now the list has grown so large that it is difficult to search for suitable projects. Fortunately, we always added the Git repositories directly to the list, so it was possible to get meta data from each project via the GitHub API. Here is the datasets we have been able to generate by crawling metadata from every project:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;airtable.com&#x2F;shr9we419r2TkpLkc<p>My experience with website development is limited. Any ideas, hints or thoughts on how we can use this data to create an open source website that is a bit more user friendly than the previous list? Of course it would be best if this is also done with open source tools.",
