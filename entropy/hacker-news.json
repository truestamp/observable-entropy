      "text": "I currently work in a good open source project, as a core developer in a medium\nsized organisation, I came across an early stage startup opportunity regarding\nproviding support and deployment of this, in this I would be working on a\ndev+support opportunity instead of working on core.<p>I work in Indian market, and the pay is more than twice my current pay, if I\nwork at this startup + I would be able to learn the pains and pleasures of\nworking at a startup.\nI am not sure am I making right decision moving from\ncore team to more support based role or not, I have 3 yrs work experience\nworking at tech and thought it might be good time to explore my risk appetite,\nbut am I taking risk on right project or not I have doubts regarding it.<p>I got this feedback from my mentor&#x2F;Team Lead and wanted to check with Industry\nfolks how will it impact my future employment, what other things should I check?",
