I have an interest in it for the purpose of optimizing my health and managing chronic conditions.<p>I&#x27;m intersted in any software with these features. But bonus points for software that 1) uses AI to predict or highlight health issues 2) has a good privacy policy and doesn&#x27;t share data with advertisers or insurance companies 3) is partially or fully open source 4) is self hosted or local, but SaaS is ok too.",
