      "text": "I need help deciding what direction to take my startup in the current climate. It’s 3 founders (friends from college) with equal equity (1 founder has a full-time job at another startup but takes the same salary and helps out) and a small team of developers. When we founded (5 years ago) we raised $4m and were focused on big data for healthcare. A few years ago we pivoted to a consumer platform. Currently we have a product in closed beta with 500 users. The problem is that the product isn’t finished and users don’t stay on the platform but there some active users share a ton of data with us. We were thinking we could do an IOT play once we get to market but we haven’t gotten around to building those features. Maybe we can become revenue positive just selling user data for research but that isn’t going to happen fast enough to cover our burn and if we cut the burn we can’t finish the product. I’m concerned because the funding market looks brutal and we have less than a year of runway. The founders don’t agree which direction to take the company in (but it’s amicable) and the other two founders are super casual about our situation. What are our options? Is the funding crisis overblown, and maybe we could raise money? Is it possible to be acquired maybe for our team or technology and find a new home? Are we better off shutting down?",
