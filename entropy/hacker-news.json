      "text": "Something I hope to try out soon but would be very happy if anyone beats me to it &#x2F; can point me to something like this that already exists.<p>Basic Idea<p>----------<p>A browser extension that hides comments on YouTube, Reddit, Twitter and Instagram.<p>Toggle needs to be convenient so users can &#x27;reveal&#x27; comments on demand.<p>An implementation for apps would be great but guessing it can&#x27;t be done.<p>There is an extension that hides YouTube comments but it&#x27;s not easily toggled and is just limited to YouTube. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;hide-youtube-comments&#x2F;kehdmnjmaakacofbgmjgjapbbibhafoh?hl=en<p>Rationale is to help with mindfulness, explained more in Background.<p>Broader Idea<p>-------------<p>Extension tracking user navigation through sites (keeping all data local) that can identify &#x27;autopilot patterns&#x27; and lets them configure indicators to gently let them know.<p>Could also provide digests &#x2F; live metrics with an estimate on time spent in autopilot.<p>It&#x27;s really important things are presented in a super non-judgemental way and are easily toggled; it shouldn&#x27;t be like the anti-distraction apps that can feel imposing rather than supporting.<p>Background<p>----------<p>I noticed that over lockdown I would spend a lot of time browsing YouTube on autopilot so, as an experiment, I started using an extension that hides comments.<p>This set-up gave me an instant &quot;you&#x27;re on autopilot&quot; signal because most of the times I switch off, I will scroll down to the comments at some point.<p>I spend way less time on YouTube now but I feel like I&#x27;m getting so much more out of it.<p>I&#x27;m more open to watching videos that I wouldn&#x27;t normally choose to; one&#x27;s outside of my normal interests and ones that I know I won&#x27;t like.<p>When watching these I can see how my ego &#x27;fires&#x27; with themes of &quot;I don&#x27;t like this person&quot; or &quot;this is really shallow&quot;, and how that often triggers autopilot.<p>When I can catch it at the moment, which happens more and more often, I can turn my attention to what I do like about what I&#x27;m seeing or what things I can empathize with.<p>It&#x27;s made my world a bit bigger and has been a nice way of adding a bit more mindfulness to my day.<p>Really interested to know how this impacts other people and changes the dynamic on different platforms.",
