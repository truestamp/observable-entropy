      "text": "The https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prooftoys.org&#x2F; website presents logic and basic\nmathematics of the real numbers.  It includes a practical embedded \ndeductive system for learners whose background may be just ordinary \nhigh school mathematics.  The site includes:<p>1. An introduction to logic through pictures, basically interactive\n   Venn diagrams with explanation. This is a point of view on\n   propositional calculus.<p>2. A brief presentation of the rules of the logic of &quot;simple type\n   theory&quot; at a raw beginner&#x27;s level.<p>3. A number of completely rigorous simple proofs, some in pure logic,\n   and some about real numbers, starting from the classic &quot;complete\n   ordered field&quot; axioms that define the behavior of real numbers. The\n   proofs are all done by computer from the ground up using the logic\n   and axioms (with a handful of gaps). The proofs are all available\n   for reading online, down to any level of detail, interactively, and\n   at the reader&#x27;s discretion.<p>4. A web-based tool that lets you build and edit your own proofs.<p>I am seeking user input on the site, and will gladly answer all kinds of\nquestions as far as I am able.",
