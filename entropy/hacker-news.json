      "text": "When traveling home for Christmas, I was thinking that traveling by train is a great means of “autonomous travel” (in fact there is an advertising by the German railway company that describes the outcomes of autonomous cars and then the punchline points towards trains).\nHowever, I get some nausea from the constant vibrations&#x2F;getting shaken up (how would a native English speaker express this?) and I am wondering how to minimize that disturbance? (Noise is no Problem any more with noise canceling headphones and, optional, music)<p>For the first version I am not primarily interested in re-engineering the whole train wagon because I don’t have the budget for that xP<p>However, I am wondering if there is a way for a clever “child seat-like” thing that buffers the movements before they reach my body? (Maybe similar to the floating backpack?)<p>I would be grateful for any pointers or contacts to mechanical(?) engineers that know how to approach that.<p>In case someone wants to build it: my personal willingness to pay is (currently) somewhere between 100-500$ if it is somehow portable like a backpack.",
