I found it after a long search of Extensions on the Chrome Web Store, using a bunch of potentially relevant keywords, etc. I didn&#x27;t find anything else (there were two others that were almost useful, but they used &quot;fuzzy search&quot; that returned irrelevant results).<p>If you&#x27;ve found anything else that indicates each returned result&#x27;s location in the folder hierarchy (e.g. via breadcrumbs) after doing a bookmarks search, please share.
