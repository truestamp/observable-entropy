      "text": "Anyone interested in a PCB that combines esp32cam, portable router, and some motor controllers for IoT control of things such as rovers, drones, etc...?\nI see that there isn&#x27;t much out there on how to do live data&#x2F;video streaming from cheap esp32cams to a personal public domain, or how to do it with portable routers for true &quot;remote&quot; control without a middle man like Raspberry Pi or PC for port forwarding.\nThinking about making PCBs and providing code to control through Google Form so that anyone can control it over WiFi.<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated!",
