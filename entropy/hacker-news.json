It may be been couched as &quot;what&#x27;s that mysterious building&quot; or somesuch, but it delved into high-voltage cables and how they need to be cooled with (flammable!) cooling oil. It was fascinating, and I&#x27;m keen to re-read it, but Google fails me. Hoping the poster is still around... and sees this before this question (rightly) gets taken down :-)",

      "text": "I would like to hear how EMs consider personal growth is and how they plan towards that. I see myself ready to take on a larger team and manage managers myself. Of course, that itself is not enough, I need my manager to also feel that way.  Generally speaking, there are two strategies, grow the team organically and then promote within or ask and have sister teams re-org and report to me. I am looking to primarily discuss the second option. I see a new manager created and they are hiring for themselves. I feel that that team really belongs under me as there is a large overlap with my team&#x27;s functionality. Did anyone go about doing that? In general though, I would like to hear how EMs consider personal growth is and how they plan towards that.",
