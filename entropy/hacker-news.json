      "text": "Hi HN ! I would like to build a shell syntax parser and I would like to do it without yacc or tools like that, for learning purposes. I have been reading a lot parsing tutorials and I got a tokenizer working. From what I have read I now either have to make a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree out of my tokens with the help of a grammar from this page.\nNow can you point me to any good documentation on how to make a tree out of it ?\nAll the tutorials I could find on the matter are made for arithmetic syntax and somehow I haven&#x27;t been able to adapt those to my use case.",
