      "text": "Virtue ethics is the cultivation of the virtues, such as moderation, perseverance and courage. This is in contrast to deontological ethics (basing the ethics of a particular action on certain rules), and Consequentialist ethics (judging the ethics of a particular action by the results {it has been observed that Western society is generally governed by Utilitarian ethics, which is a subset of Consequentialism that judges the ethicality of actions by how much happiness they produce}).<p>So the problem with the latter two ethics is that they assume the virtue; the rules may not always apply to the situation (e.g. <i>please</i> don&#x27;t tell the ax murderer which bedroom your children are in because Kant thinks you should) and the value of any particular consequence is usually, if not always, situational.<p>Virtue ethics takes care of everything by giving the individual their own compass, so to speak. I think some people have the idea that trying to live virtuously is unpleasant or a real drag, but as a recovering drug addict, I can tell you I wouldn&#x27;t practice it if it was.",
