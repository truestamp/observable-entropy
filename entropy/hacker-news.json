I am already earning 74k at my current job and I was really expecting them to make me a higher offers because I told them upfront. \nI reminded them of my current salary and said, that I can&#x27;t even consider taking their current offer. \nThey went back to do internal discussion. \nI fear, that they will come up with a new offer matching my current TC. However I would only consider switching, when there is an actual premium in comparison to current TC (let&#x27;s say 80k and I am in). \nDo you have tips how to react? \nFor context: I am also in the interview process with two other companies, which seems to offer the salary I am aiming for. However I have not yet arrived at this stage.",
