Everything is upgraded to a &quot;specialist&quot;.<p>When I do get answers, every support person has a different answer.<p>For example:<p>Sick hours didn&#x27;t show up on Jan 1st (like the policy stated). First support person had me experiment with creating multiple policies to triage the issue, eventually telling me I had to enter hours manually.<p>Second time I called in, the person told me they accrue hours only after the first payroll.<p>After the first payroll, only SOME of the employees accrued sick time off. \nNow the issue has been upgraded to a &quot;specialist&quot;.<p>This is only one of a handful of such issues I&#x27;m facing.<p>Curious to see if this experience is common with others? \nI did trials with BambooHR and Gusto, and now regretting my decision.",
