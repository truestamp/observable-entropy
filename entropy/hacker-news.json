      "text": "TLDR: I am making a bookmarking app, what would improve your bookmarking experience?<p>I am currently working on a product to improve the bookmarking experience on the internet. I surf the web almost every day and come across interesting articles all the time. I don&#x27;t always have time to read them or want to come back to them later, so I then bookmark them. However, this often results in me forgetting about them or not finding them because I don&#x27;t remember in which browser and on what device I bookmarked the link.<p>Therefore I started making my own bookmarking app. It will have \n- import and export (JSON, CSV, markdown, txt)\n- web&#x2F;native app \n- suggest three random bookmarks to remind the user about them\n- extension for frictionless bookmarking\n- extension that shows your bookmarks that relate to a google search\n- notes to remember ideas\n- folders and share folders (collaborative bookmarking)\n- categories to enable a broader search if the bookmark title is forgotten\n- download the site to prevent link rotting<p>Would you use an app like this and what other features would you wish for?",

It makes sense, but I am tired of finding my laptop out of charge on Monday morning, so I am disabling secure boot.\nThe problem is, how damaging is this?
