For past 15+ years, I have shipped and maintained large and small web apps mostly using REST, C#, ASP.NET Core, JavaScript and react. I am familiar&#x2F;dabbled with JS ecosystem and libraries but never built anything production grade in full stack JS.<p>I want to build an todo app with auth, user roles and permissions, graphql to fetch and mutate data in postgresql db.<p>What libraries you would recommend that are good, stable, battle tested and would be around for few more years ?<p>Thank you.",
