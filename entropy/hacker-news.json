      "text": "Greetings HN community.<p>I got an idea to built something and wanted to check if you (Front end devs, Software Architects) would use &#x2F; include into your dev stack?<p>1. A browser extension, which intercepts any API calls, that you configure into extension, in any tab in same browser Window, instead of original server response, revert back with whatever response you configure for that API call into the extension.<p>2. You can create logical clusters &#x2F; modules of API calls page wise or functionality wise, to maintain and better usability.<p>3. You can store it on cloud, grant access to your teams, share it across so that anyone else can directly download the module &#x2F; folder and start running client side code without server side code, or with custom API response to just selected APIs.<p>USE CASES:<p>1. You could start client side work without server side code ready. (I know there are tons of other solutions already good at this, but this one also intercepts your existing API calls to quickly test &#x2F; develop &#x2F; POC.)<p>2. You can quickly check what your web app looks like with different server response for few APIs.<p>3. Run client side stack without server side code setup, if you&#x27;re just interested in spinning up client side code in your local machine.<p>4. It could serve as a client side &lt;&gt; server side API contract<p>5. You could have version control (V1 of Billing module, V1.1 of Billing module or Billing module for X enterprise client etc.)<p>6. You can record all API calls since a page is loaded, to capture all the API end points being called to render the page.<p>I&#x27;ve always consumed HN feed, this is the first time I am seeking help here. Please school me on anything I can to be one amongst HN community.<p>Happy holidays and be safe.<p>-mohit",
