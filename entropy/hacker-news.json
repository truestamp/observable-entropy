I feel like to continue growing I need to be in a place with fewer people, less noise and more nature (not to mention being able to save more $$).<p>I have a number of friends living in Boulder and Denver, however I&#x27;m not too sure if I want to make the jump to CO given their recent employment laws mandating employers publish salaries up front[0].  Although I support this legislation and the core initiatives of transparent compensation disclosure it&#x27;s clearly driving some companies to explicitly not hire remote in CO.<p>Curious if anyone else here on HN can comment on the current hiring climate here, both for startups and growth stage companies that are full remote (think Stripe, Brex, etc).<p>0 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shrm.org&#x2F;resourcesandtools&#x2F;legal-and-compliance&#x2F;state-and-local-updates&#x2F;pages&#x2F;some-employers-are-excluding-colorado-applicants-for-remote-work.aspx<p>direct link to CO &quot;Equal Pay for Equal Work Act&quot; text - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leg.colorado.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;2019a_085_signed.pdf",
