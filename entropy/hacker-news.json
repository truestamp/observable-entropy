      "text": "Hi,\nafter a long job hunting period I joined a small remote first company 5 months ago.<p>Problems showed up immediately in the form of chaos and dysfunctions in the microservices cloud project I was hired in. Let&#x27;s put it this way: say you get the seminal book on microservices and the seminal book on CICD. Now imagine reading along and doing almost everything from code up to project management the wrong way (essentially keeping on-prem 2000&#x27;s philosophy and revamp it as microservices). On top of that add vendeta-developers in Asia (I&#x27;m in a small offshoot team in Europe) handing down half-baked frameworks (not-invented-here and reinventing the wheel are strong) with minimal documentation and a culture based on meetings instead of documenting things. Developer sandboxes that just don&#x27;t work and unrealistic deadlines. In short a huge draining mess where I felt burnt out just a few months after I joined and where I honestly don&#x27;t want to spent another minute.<p>Almost every attempt of mine to change anything was met with either &quot;yeah we know but we have to live with it for now&quot; or a straight denial to hear me out - brushed aside as a newcomer (I&#x27;m senior and was hired as such).<p>So, the question is, is it unprofessional to abandon ship just 6 months in or given the circumstances is exactly what I should do in order to protect my well being and my career prospects (the project is a slow motion train wreck IMO).",
