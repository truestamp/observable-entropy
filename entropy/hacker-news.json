      "text": "I&#x27;ve been spinning my wheels trying to get my business off the ground for four years and really want to get back into an environment where I&#x27;m not solely responsible for pushing forward every aspect of a project (including all of the &quot;fun&quot; business maintenance aspects). However, for the last year I&#x27;ve also been taking care of a &lt;1 year old full time and have hesitation interviewing for dev positions again because 1) there didn&#x27;t feel like enough time in the day to study for interviews before.. much less now and 2) my IQ seems to have temporarily dipped from being a stay-at-home dad with all of the distractions that entails.<p>It&#x27;s a nice fantasy that I&#x27;d be able to reject all interview processes that have either coding tests or whiteboard grilling, but my experience so far has been that the companies without that either don&#x27;t exist or aren&#x27;t interested in me. I&#x27;m not in a particularly hot tech hub -- although the recent uptick in indefinitely remote positions has gotten me to start looking seriously again. It&#x27;s really hard to imagine I&#x27;d be competitive for these positions if I was struggling to get interviews before. (My business was initially started out of desperation and for something to do other than study for interviews).<p>(Edit: Part of the text was lost at some point and I can&#x27;t remember all of it.)",
