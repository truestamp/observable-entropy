      "text": "A few months ago there was a supply-chain attack involving the npm package node-ipc, in which one of the maintainers sabotaged the codebase to delete files on thousands of people&#x27;s computers.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;sabotage-code-added-to-popular-npm-package-wiped-files-in-russia-and-belarus&#x2F;<p>I just wanted to bring up the fact that the perpetrator behind this cyberattack, &quot;RIAEvangelist&quot;, is currently not banned on Github. Hours after publishing the malware code on Github&#x27;s node-ipc repository temporarily locked his account. But given the fact that his activity remained shortly after, it means Microsoft didnt opt to punish him very long (or at all?).<p>What are the broader implications of Microsoft&#x27;s inaction against a clear case of computer sabotage? Could their inaction against this user be interpreted as negligence? Could it be interpreted as a relaxation of company policy restrictions against malware being hosted on Github? Discuss.",
