      "text": "Web services and sites really should stop using dark theme forcefully matching it to a browser or system dark UI theme. Users often use dark theme to distinguish UI from content, not blend content with UI. Properly speaking it&#x27;s not very user and eye friendly to read for long white text on a dark background. Sites that automatically force a dark theme on visitors remind me of a noob user that learn a new colorful style trick in Word processor who starts applying it in every document.<p>It&#x27;s good if a site offers dark theme option via some kind of switch but forcing it on visitors is not the brightest decision. E.g. browser version of Google Books automatically force dark theme while reading a book in case a browser uses one for UI.<p>More and more I notice that sites do that. And often they even don&#x27;t offer option to switch the site to a light theme. They just use a browser&#x27;s UI theme as a guide. It requires to switch a browser to a light one for such sites to use light theme. Thankfully, Google Books offers an option to switch but it annoying to do it every single time I open it.<p>Dark UI is to distinguish from, not to blend with content.",
