      "text": "Hi friends,<p>I have noticed that since maybe a month ago YouTube has been scaling down video quality for EVERY video played. It doesn&#x27;t make sense because I have a pretty good network that can play at highest quality so I guess the only reason is to scale back output.<p>Have you experienced the same? Any solution to force 1080 without manual intervention? Thanks!",
