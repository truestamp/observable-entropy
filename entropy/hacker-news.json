      "text": "I don’t even know how to describe mine or where to begin. I literally can’t remember certain details as if I suffered from trauma. I lasted 3 years and never got close to a 6 figure compensation. I’ve never even experienced working with a senior developer. Despite this the clients using my work were F500 companies.<p>It would make sense for me to begin elaborating on some of my stories, but it is really difficult for me with how upsetting a lot of this was. Maybe I&#x27;ll try later in the comments. All I can think to say is that I eventually quit when asked to implement a plainly unethical surveillance feature. It was long overdue. Trying to stick it out at one place for a while, as if it would make me appear dependable and valuable, has to be one of the biggest mistakes of my entire life so far.<p>This was 2 years ago, and I have not worked since. I would like to, but it doesn’t even feel like a choice for me. All I wanted was to get my foot in the door and begin my career yet I somehow feel farther behind than when I started.<p>So who else has a totally shit developer career? Can you make me feel better by telling me about it?<p>Edit: This is a throwaway for obvious reasons, sorry dang.",
