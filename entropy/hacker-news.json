      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I am looking for textbooks and&#x2F;or online courses that go over the Variational Bayes method systematically based on math and probability theory. I&#x27;m less interested in coding so not too keen to know Python or R packages and tutorials involving them.<p>I will really appreciate it if anyone who works in this area can suggest books or online courses. Even if the course is not free, that&#x27;s all right. Thank you!",
