      "text": "Hey, HN. I thought you might be interested in a tool I wrote over a few days. As part of a recent IETF hackathon event demonstrating dynamic DNS updates over a private and secure channel (DoT, DoH, DoQ) I needed something to demonstrate the that the software was capable of performing the tasks. This was relatively straightforward with the what I think of as excellent CLI capabilities in the Rust ecosystem with Clap, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;clap&#x2F;latest&#x2F;clap&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rs&#x2F;clap&#x2F;latest&#x2F;clap&#x2F;</a>. Anyway, I thought I&#x27;d share it with the HN community in case folks find it useful.<p>The tool is vaguely like `dig`, I called it `dns`. It&#x27;s similar in that it allows a single DNS message to be sent and await a response. This is by no means as comprehensive as `dig`, yet, but might be suitable as a simpler and easier to use command. For example, issuing a DoH query can be done with:<p>`dns -p https -t cloudflare-dns.com -n 1.1.1.1:443 query www.example.com. SOA `<p>And similarly a dynamic update can be performed with:<p>`dns -p tls -n ${NS_IP}:853 -t ${CERT_NAME} -z example.com. create txt.example.com. TXT 60 HELLO_WORLD`<p>For auth I still need to wire up SIG0 and TSIG support, at least SIG0 should be easy enough. I&#x27;ll try and find some time to do that when I have a moment.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll try and respond if there are any questions in this thread today.<p>Thanks-<p>-Ben",
