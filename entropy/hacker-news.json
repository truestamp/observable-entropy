      "text": "Due to COVID, a consultation on the location of a secondary school campus was held entirely online by my local Council in the UK. It has been contentious because there were five options and the Council&#x27;s preferred one involved sacrificing a local greenspace&#x2F;park.<p>They concluded that the silent majority preferred their option because the site received 1500 visits and 70 objections (preferring an alternative) versus 20 non-negative comments.<p>They are using this 1500 number to justify their position. I&#x27;d noted accessibility issues (the site says certain user agents are incompatible and you can&#x27;t view the site at all)<p>That in context, the site itself had a cookie splash screen asking to accept or reject cookies for analytics. Upon viewing the source code I noticed that the buttons were the wrong way round, i.e. those who rejected cookies were being tracked those who clicked accept were not being tracked.<p>Is this a clear cut case of a GDPR breach and the information collected should be thrown away? I have sent relevant information to ICO but wondered if the wisdom of the HN crowd could offer further info.",
