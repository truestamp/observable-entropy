      "text": "Multiplayer, hyper-collaborative tools like Figma, Google Sheets, Replitâ€¦ are built with the Maker in mind. They create rich, vertical contexts for designers, developers, analysts to bloom &amp; build.<p>When both specialized work and collab happen speedily and losslessly within these apps, for a Maker to go to Slack, email and&#x2F;or Jira becomes a channel of last resort.<p>But Managers live on these tools! And management means setting deadlines, switching &quot;gears&quot;, unblocking others, shifting priorities... things you can&#x27;t do on the Makers&#x27; tools.<p>My thesis is that on this massive, abrupt shift to working remotely, management tools not only haven&#x27;t been able to keep up with a Manager&#x27;s needs, but they have created new jobs-to-be-done. Whatever JTBD you may think of, it all comes down to one key constraint: finite time.<p>Prior to the covid-19 crisis, time was dealt with 20th-century, office-first, protocols. Hierarchical, cultural and physical protocols that double down as constraints: seniority, office distribution, culture, capital allocation, permissions, etc. Basically, a CEO&#x27;s unit-of-time was 1,000x more valuable than a jr sales rep&#x27;s.<p>It is baffling then to realize how far these management tools are from replicating those real-life constraints. While we live in a physical world of -certain- scarcity, the Manager&#x27;s tech stack is an open firehose of emails, notifications, channels and threads that keep piling on until the system collapses... or he&#x2F;she breaks down.<p>To reach parity and increase productivity across teams, the tech stack should aim to replicate the best out of these constraints, leaving the &quot;bad&quot; ones (9-to-5, all-sync, top-down, command &amp; control, etc.) behind.<p>By &quot;replicating&quot; I don&#x27;t mean adding new features (copied from competitors); I mean toppling a few paradigms off their pedestals prior to start building a more decentralized, constrained-ridden (less-is-more) management tool.<p>Thoughts?",
