      "text": "I&#x27;m starting to get the feeling that the US essentially tries to flood the internet with as much pro American propaganda to help drown out views contrary to policy versus active suppression of dissenting thought. Does anyone else get that feeling when on the internet lately? It seems very counter intuitive because we I talk to people in real life, it&#x27;s quite the opposite experience. People seem to understand way more, even if they disagreed and consider my point as new because they&#x27;ve never thought about it before.",
