I&#x27;ve been having to redo work in the last month - even after getting it reviewed and checking in on if this is how the work is supposed to be done. I try to do it to satisfy my direct manager, but they seem very disorganized and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel very confident in the company. there were also laws passed that seem to be our current business model.<p>are these signs of a failing start up or something else?",
