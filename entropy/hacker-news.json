      "text": "My application is a bunch of docker containers networked together using docker compose.<p>Now I want to ship this entire stack as an easily runnable application to my users, who are either on Linux or Windows (and occasionally Mac).<p>Ideally the user doesn&#x27;t even know that docker is involved, and it just looks like one app from most perspectives. I want it to be easy to install and maintain.<p>To further complicate things, many of the containers are actually dependent on nvidia-docker and GPU access for CUDA. This seems to just now be supported on Windows, albeit only Windows 11. In general, this greatly complicates my ability to ship anything easy-to-install.<p>Is there anything I can do to make this process easy for users (and myself)?<p>NVIDIA and docker have both taken over huge swaths of our computing infrastructure, but they are in some ways a huge regression for easy software delivery, which is somewhat ironic in the case of Docker.",
