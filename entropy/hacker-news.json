I&#x27;m now reading &#x27;Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach&#x27;.<p>My flow is to simply write down notes as I go through each chapter and review them at the end of each chapter. I don&#x27;t do any of the exercises, though I probably should. Recently, I&#x27;ve been thinking that studying CS in a group setting will be more fun.<p>Do you engage with other students &#x2F; the writers when you read through a CS &#x2F; Tech book?",
