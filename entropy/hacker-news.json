But I had a hard time holding myself accountable for my goals. \nThat&#x27;s why I tried different approaches. Here is what worked for me:<p>- Building compounding habits is far more important than a one-time goal<p>- Finding an accountability partner that helps you stay on track<p>- Doing a regular self-reflection:<p>1. I write a review about every area of your life (e.g., Family, Relationship, Friends, Experiences, Passions, Business, Money, Emotion, Health).<p>2. I then focus on the top two areas I want to improve. I write a preview with concrete action items and measurable goals.<p>3. I email my notes to my future self (in 90 days, using a free service) to remind myself what my previous thoughts were and to repeat this exercise.<p>How do you set and track your life goals?",
