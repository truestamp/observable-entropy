      "text": "I am currently a full stack developer but I&#x27;m barely working throughout the week. This past month I&#x27;ve probably put in about 3-4 hours a week and its been like that for the past 6 months. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;m basically getting paid to barely do any work and I have a ton of free time but I feel like I&#x27;m not living up to my potential and not even growing as a developer. Ive thought about going the freelance&#x2F;contract route since I have all this time but I&#x27;m not even sure where to start.<p>What would you do in my situation?",
