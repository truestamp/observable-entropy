      "text": "We&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive data quality solution (app&#x2F;framework) to assist us with the identification of gaps in time-series data as well as the identification of potentially problematic data points using some basic statistics.<p>Ideally, I&#x27;d want to be able to host the solution and automate it to run daily and spit out a report outlining potential issues. The data is all normalized and housed in a single SQL DB. We&#x27;ve written our own bespoke framework for this, but our team is too small to realistically maintain it.<p>Any suggestions?",
