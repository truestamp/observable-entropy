      "text": "No clue how I am learning this only now, but better later than never: HTTPS `keepAlive` is not enabled by default in Node.js, and it has severe performance implications to network-intense applications.<p>Just to illustrate the impact, assuming that your server is hosted in `us-central1` and it is talking to a service in `us-east1`, just the network latency is ~20ms. Since a TCP handshake is a 3-packet event, this means that ~60ms are going to be allocated just to establish TLS handshake.<p>You can test that with a simple script:<p>```ts\nconst got = require(&#x27;got&#x27;);<p>const main = async () =&gt; {\n  const response0 = await got(&#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;&#x27;);<p><pre><code>  console.log(response0.timings.phases);\n\n  const response1 = await got(&#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;&#x27;);\n\n  console.log(response1.timings.phases);</code></pre>\n};<p>main();\n```<p>In this scenario, the above will produce:<p>```ts\n{\n  wait: 1,\n  dns: 20,\n  tcp: 72,\n  tls: 74,\n  request: 0,\n  firstByte: 79,\n  download: 222,\n  total: 468\n}\n{\n  wait: 0,\n  dns: 1,\n  tcp: 67,\n  tls: 69,\n  request: 1,\n  firstByte: 73,\n  download: 234,\n  total: 445\n}\n```<p>However, watch the `total` time if we enable `keepAlive`:<p>```ts\nconst got = require(&#x27;got&#x27;);\nconst https = require(&#x27;https&#x27;);<p>https.globalAgent = new https.Agent({ keepAlive:true });<p>const main = async () =&gt; {\n  const response0 = await got(&#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;&#x27;);<p><pre><code>  console.log(response0.timings.phases);\n\n  const response1 = await got(&#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;&#x27;);\n\n  console.log(response1.timings.phases);</code></pre>\n};<p>main();\n```<p>```ts\n{\n  wait: 1,\n  dns: 27,\n  tcp: 77,\n  tls: 75,\n  request: 0,\n  firstByte: 75,\n  download: 220,\n  total: 475\n}\n{\n  wait: 0,\n  dns: 0,\n  tcp: 0,\n  tls: 0,\n  request: 0,\n  firstByte: 77,\n  download: 83,\n  total: 160\n}\n```<p>The second request is 70% faster than the first request!<p>If your application relies on making many HTTPS calls, then simply enabling `keepAlive` is going to result in a significant performance improvement.",
