      "text": "I want to manage my large-ish photo collection (a few thousand photos and small videos) using a tool where I can assign keywords, quickly iterate through them and delete unwanted photos, change metadata (titles etc.), make small modifications (exposure, crop, orientation etc.), look at the geotagged photos on a map etc.<p>However, I am looking for a tool that works with photos within an existing folder structure on the disk and modifies directly EXIF metadata instead of using some database or proprietary file structure which makes it difficult or impossible to switch to another tool later (e.g. I do not want to use Apple Photos or Lightroom due to this).<p>What tool would you recommend for this? I am open for Linux, Mac or Windows suggestionsâ€¦",
