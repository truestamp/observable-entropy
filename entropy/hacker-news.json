I do drawing&#x2F;painting occasionally, but I&#x27;m unable to capture even a simple scene, let alone my mindscapes.<p>I know, it takes great practice, and a huge time investment. I&#x27;m seeking guidance on the most efficient method to get to the point of recreation of ephemeral images in my mind.<p>I&#x27;ve probably got more experience in 3D modelling (comes more naturally thus far), but if it&#x27;s easier to recreate life-like images in a 2d medium, then I&#x27;d probably jump that way to get up and running quickly.",

      "text": " Hi HN! We&#x27;re Sebas and Elias, and we are building Telekinesis: a serverless platform aimed to make it easy to deploy complex applications.<p>We love serverless because it abstracts away the infrastructure but we think we can take it a step further: abstract away the communication. Effectively, a place where you just code any function or class, we run it in the cloud, and then let you connect securely to it. To be truly easy, it has to support:<p>- stateful objects: you can instantiate classes and manipulate them through our secured websockets connection<p>- any pip&#x2F;npm package dependencies: we&#x27;ll keep a container with your dependencies ready to run your code when your service is invoked<p>Since now these services would be pure logic, we can efficiently compose them, just like with open source (pip or npm) packages. However, there would be one key difference, here you can put a price on your code. In this setup, developers could opt in to have their code become open source automatically after a certain amount of time or if it hits an income threshold.<p>We&#x27;re a long way from the &quot;function marketplace&quot; idea, but we have an early version of the serverless platform you can try at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telekinesis.cloud.<p>We are looking for our first users to try our product. We&#x27;re especially interested in working closely with anyone that&#x27;s building a prototype. If you are interested you can register for early access or email us at contact@telekinesis.cloud<p>Lastly, if you share any feedback below it would have an enormous value for us. Thanks everyone!",
