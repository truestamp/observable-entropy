      "text": "I used to have a fairly elaborate system of vlans and access points and switches and so on. After we switched to Bell fiber  in Toronto  Canada, we just use their home hub 3000<p>Performance is good but super inconsistent. We live in a house but it&#x27;s heavily saturated by neighbours blasting their WiFi. My throughput is great but latency and connectivity are super inconsistent.<p>Googling mostly gives useless entry level suggestions many of which are practically wrong - just set up transmission to extra high everywhere.<p>Any tips on how to actually make a good WiFi coming off bell home hub, on particular for phone cloud gaming?",
