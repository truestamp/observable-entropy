Surely something like a USB-C cable can do this?<p>For comparison, I still have and use my original wired EarPods with their 3.5mm jack from back in the day - which work perfectly after many years of heavy use.<p>I wish Apple would release a USB-C wired version of these with Active Noise Cancelling like in their AirPods Pro.<p>It would be helluva practical for those long work sessions and also better for the environment.<p>My next best bet is the Bose QC20 - but even these have a quasi-battery solution which ultimately depletes.",
