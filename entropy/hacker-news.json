      "text": "Whenever I click a link on my computer (e.g, from email or Messages), it opens by default in my browser of choice, but never in an Incognito window.<p>Nearly 100% of the time, I want it to open in Incognito, which I use whenever I&#x27;m visiting a site that I don&#x27;t need to be logged into. My current workaround is to right-click the link, copy link, switch to my browser, open a new Incognito window, paste in the link and hit return. While this doesn&#x27;t seem like that big a deal, it&#x27;s actually a lot of clicks (11 key presses) â€” compared to just one click to open a link normally. Additionally, it puts the pasted link into my pasteboard manager, which is unnecessary and annoying when I go to retrieve a snippet that is now further down in the stack.<p>What&#x27;s the best way to handle this? I&#x27;ve considered switching my default browser to a different browser that completely blocks cookies and forgets history all the time, but it seems like there should be a better solution.",

      "text": "Hello HN, who here doesn&#x27;t use a phone and what do you use as a replacement?<p>I&#x27;ve been using my phone less and less these days, and it feels like a chore to use a modern phone now. Touch interface is slow and imprecise, apps and webapps are slow, bloated, and keep removing useful features, adblock on some systems are clunky or non-existent, VoIP and SMS are basically dead, the interface changes nearly every year (on android at least), and many other small grievances. I can get things done so much quicker on a computer with a keyboard compared to the touch interface on a phone, using a keyboard and a full desktop environment is so precise, quick, and just enjoyable to use.<p>However, I am still hanging onto my phone for a few legacy uses, what are some good replacements for these:<p>* Mobile wifi\n* VoIP\n* SMS<p>Also, I am still interested in mobile computing as a concept, I&#x27;ve looked into the pinephone and that may be a good replacement for me in the future (keyboard attachment, linux apps), but am fine completely ditching mobile computing and just carrying around a small, light laptop if I can&#x27;t find an ergonomic mobile replacement.<p>Anyone ditch their phone, how do you get by without it?",
