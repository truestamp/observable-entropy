      "text": "Hi HN. My wife&#x27;s Instagram account has been deactivated and blocked because we moved and don&#x27;t have the phone number associated with the account anymore. It&#x27;s asking for the SMS verification code. All attempts to get help have failed, and many require being logged in. There seems no way to contact a human.<p>We&#x27;re working with a friend back where we came from, trying to get the number back. It may not be possible.<p>Is her account of ten years just gone? She was slowly building up her audience hoping to be an &quot;influencer&quot; one day. The thought of starting over from zero is heart breaking for her.<p>Is there anything we can try?",
