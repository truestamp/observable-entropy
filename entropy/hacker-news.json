      "text": "I am aware of the various published test results where CoreCLR shows fantastic speed-ups compared to Mono, e.g. when calculating MD5 or SHA hash sums.<p>But my measurements based on the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;smarr&#x2F;are-we-fast-yet and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;Oberon&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;testcases&#x2F;Are-we-fast-yet) show a completely different picture. Here the difference between Mono and CoreCLR (both versions 3 and 5) is within +&#x2F;- 10%, so nothing earth shattering.<p>Here are my measurement results:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;Oberon&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;testcases&#x2F;Are-we-fast-yet&#x2F;Are-we-fast-yet_results_linux.pdf comparing the same benchmark on the same machine run under LuaJIT, Mono, Node.js and Crystal.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;Oberon&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;testcases&#x2F;Are-we-fast-yet&#x2F;Are-we-fast-yet_results_windows.pdf comparing Mono, .Net 4 and CoreCLR 3 and 5 on the same machine.<p>Here are the assemblies of the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite used for the measurements, in case you want to reproduce my results: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.rochus-keller.ch&#x2F;Are-we-fast-yet_CLI_2021-08-28.zip.<p>I was very surprised by the results. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I measured on x86, or that the benchmark suite in use includes somewhat larger (i.e. more representative) applications than just micro benchmarks.<p>What are your opinions? Do others have similar results?",
