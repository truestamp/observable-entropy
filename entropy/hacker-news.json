      "text": "There is a very common (dark?) pattern I see employed by practically everyone in the industry, instead of charging for differentiating features, we seem to accept that it&#x27;s ok to charge for security features as premium features in the pretense that these are &quot;Enterprise Features&quot;. I am not here to name and shame but you know how it works. Role Based Access Control, SSO integration, API access to audit logs, MFA are presented as &quot;premium enterprise features&quot;, why isn&#x27;t there a bigger backlash? Why is this practice not pushed back by everyone? The startup I&#x27;m building, we are committing to provide SSO&#x2F;SAML&#x2F;OIDC, audit logs, advanced RBAC etc for free for everyone, we want people to pay for actual differentiating features. Am I missing something here?",
