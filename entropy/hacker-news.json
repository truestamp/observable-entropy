      "text": "I have a conspiracy theory* that, two widely used languages in the software industry are bad not because that people cannot make it good, rather, there is a hidden, organized effort that is surgically putting the language in a spot where it is barely acceptable to the current public&#x27;s taste, and maintains a high development and maintaining cost at the same time, so that some individuals, companies, even the software industry itself, can continuously milk profits from the language, in the form of salaries, tooling and consulting fees, contracts for maintaining the resulting, often buggy, software, etc..<p>In summary, a strategically bad language creates more jobs, and generating more profits for individuals and companies (whose product, more or less, is the language itself) in the software industry.<p>Is rust hitting the sweet spot between providing jobs and profits for the software industry, and being a good language?<p>* this is pure speculation based on personal observation, I don&#x27;t have any actual evidence, nor did I try to collect any.",
