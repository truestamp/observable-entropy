Even with digital signage on the rise, we often tend to neglect one of the center focal points of our living and office spaces... the TV. Looking for a way to utilize this otherwise empty canvas, Party Banner takes every special occasion to the next level with premium digital banners that help decorate your space. Please share your thoughts on the app, and any banner designs you would like to see in future updates. Thanks, and party on!",
