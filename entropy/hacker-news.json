      "text": "Somehow, we continue to disregard what is staring us right in our faces. Simply put, … the truth!<p>What truth? A couple, a couple of serious problems that is contributing to the self-destruction of the United States of America. Now, I would like to preface this with the fact that I hope this provokes you, because it should.<p>As an American, I have noticed that people have very fragile beliefs here.\nTo the point that if challenged, it is almost as if they crumble or short circuit when confronted with something foreign to them. It makes sense but for one reason, most tend to fear the unknown to an irrational degree. This form of indoctrination of non-critical thinking or the inability to think for yourself starts from the second you come out of the womb, and into your parent&#x27;s arms. They tell your truth, before you can observe it yourself to confirm, they fill your head with what they like; what they want you to be!<p>Then so do your teachers, politicians, etc. They force-feed us lies, in hopes that we will be more like themselves or our perception of what they represent to us. Then we are lied too once more and are trained to believe that there is any other race than human. Which is false, there is nothing racial about varying pigments, skin pigmentation is simply a result of the climate you are subjected too. But we are fighting and killing over race, religion, and man made beliefs, that did not begin with us and are scientifically false or implausible. For some reason we often try to disassociate from the fact that we are animals (Mammals), we self-domesticate, and think we need a government to survive and this is why we are such an easy people to brainwash, it’s a cultural thing! Actually, on an instinctual level human beings are very much like dogs, easy to train and are territorial. As far as I can tell, the animal kingdom was doing fine before us animals came into the picture, natural selection; it’s a thing.<p>So the reality of needing (God = Government) is actually not real at all, and this is merely another fundamental flaw in your ability to think with your own brain.<p>~ Om1n0us",
