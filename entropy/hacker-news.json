      "text": "Hi HN. I am in my late 30s working and have been working for the same company for around 10 years. My role has ranged from consulting to product management to now sales and business development. Responding to RFPs is definitely not my dream and I have been considering a career change but I am not stuck on what to pursue. Being a pure product manager is one possibility but I do like customer engagement and really understanding the issues and concerns clients have.<p>The other part of this is that I am in an industry that isn&#x27;t really changing all that much. There&#x27;s a lot of consolidation and we&#x27;re not seeing tremendous growth in sales, in fact the writing is on the wall that our competitors are making more strides than us.<p>Any tips on positioning myself, my resume, etc. for the correct role? Do I cast a wide net and just hope to get bites? My worry is being able to even get a foot in the door because I have no relevant industry experience outside of the one I am in.",
