      "text": "For the sake of non-logistics professionals, I&#x27;d use an example in the HR industry to explain the problem. I&#x27;m sure most people are familiar with Zip Recruiter. Zip recruiter allows you create one job-post that is then circulated to hundreds of job boards. It is a really important tool for hiring managers because with Zip Recruiter, you only need to create the job post once (saves you time spent creating separate job posts for hundreds of recruiting websites). Now, imagine LinkedIn purchased Zip recruiter and announced that they will be phasing out the service. Obviously, LinkedIn as a jobs board themselves is in competition with the other job boards so owning Zip Recruiter will ensure their competition is starved of job postings (all applicants will end up going to Linkedin where all the job postings are. they are the biggest player in the industry after all)<p>This is the situation in the logistics space currently. A bigger company purchased a small player and there is no replacement. Now everyone is scrambling and preparing for the day the &#x27;zip recruiter&#x27; solution is phased out. For any savy coders who can build something useable in 30days, you have guaranteed customers cos there are no other &#x27;zip recruiter solutions&#x27; in the industry. Anyway, happy to share more info for anyone who&#x27;s interested. I&#x27;m a non-technical founder who already runs a startup so it may be too much for me to focus on this right now (the time window is short). Happy to guide anyone interested in taking on this challenge and possibly introduce you to contacts in the industry as well. Let me know if you have questions.",
