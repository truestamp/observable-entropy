      "text": "I’m Arsalan, founder of Livedocs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livedocs.com).<p>Livedocs lets you bring live data from your existing tools (like Stripe, Segment, Google Analytics, or even your data warehouse) into your documents, so you and your team don’t waste time updating reports, pasting numbers or screenshots into documents.<p>While working at early stage teams in the past, I got tired of tracking and reporting even simple metrics. My team would resort to either esoteric hacks, VBA scripts or simply nagging data guys for even simple metrics. Tracking metrics from multiple tools is a pain in the neck — so we solved it!<p>Livedocs documents are simple to build and even simpler to share. Take Livedocs for a spin with a pre-built template. Head over to [livedocs.com&#x2F;templates](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;livedocs.com&#x2F;templates), pick a template you like, connect your tools, and you’re ready to go!",
