      "text": "I&#x27;m a professional developer by day and looking to build something people would use since my job can&#x27;t seem to scratch that itch. I&#x27;m a firm believer in that if you use a product for free, then you are the product.  I was thinking of building a website that provides an array of personal web services that people use for a small monthly fee. For example, each day, I use a bookmark manager, budget tracker, and note taking app. I was thinking of starting these web services and build more as interest grows. Other services could include blogging, a place to display your resume, and any other services users may suggest. I was thinking a small fee of $1 per month could sustain this. It would be privacy friendly and you can take all your data if you choose to leave. Would anybody have any interest in this? Any feedback is welcomed!",
