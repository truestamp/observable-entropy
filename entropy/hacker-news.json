He&#x27;s been a tutor for a number of years and has a very high level of maths but he&#x27;s looking for something a bit more stable.<p>He likes the idea of coding and has started down the route of being a web developer. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be a rockstar developer with some experience under his belt but getting the right first job is the toughest.<p>Anybody out there hiring junior web developers, ideally in London UK? Or recommendations where to look?",
