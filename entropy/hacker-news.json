      "text": "So I am a contractor at FAANG in a major US city. I have participated in startups for some time, enjoyed it a lot, gotten to a YC interview once (sadly didn’t make it). One of my best buddies is talking about maybe relocating to the Valley (I am on the east coast) and I am very interested in joining him. We both work at the same company on the same project and want to pursue our remote contracts while giving our side projects a better chance at growth. We really enjoy remote work so location never was an issue. However, I do think there is a lot of validity to relocating. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",
