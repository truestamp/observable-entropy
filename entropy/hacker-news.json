      "text": " I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for a long time but I&#x27;ve taken time off to cross-train in product development and UX design, with the intention of working in a combined role.\nSelf-learning has been going well, I&#x27;m halfway through the Google UX course and I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of exercises and putting together a portfolio.<p>But when I was young I worked tech support and I got to thinking how seeing the pain points on the product support side would help immensely to understand how design decisions impact the end user.<p>Would it be insane to take a product support role for 6 months to a year while I work on my UX portfolio, side projects and self-education?<p>I&#x27;ll take a haircut on salary, but money&#x27;s not an issue right now due to a combination of a low COL and savings.<p>If you hire and saw someone shifted gears this way, would that be a plus or a minus in your evaluation? Or would it make more sense to continue on my own and try and go directly to a combined engineering&#x2F;product role?",
