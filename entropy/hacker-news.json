      "text": "If inflationary cosmology is correct, then the observable universe was the size of a softball or a basketball or something of that order at the time inflation ended (~10^-32 seconds after the big bang).  And all the mass of the observable universe was inside that little sphere.<p>Which means that the mass was inside the Schwarzchild Radius for that amount of mass.  Which means that the observable universe should have been a black hole.<p>So:  <i>Was</i> the observable universe a black hole?  If not, why not?  (ELI20 or so, please, if possible.)<p>If it was a black hole, is it still?  If not, how did we go from &quot;was a black hole&quot; to &quot;is not a black hole&quot;, and when did we do so?<p>If it is still a black hole, then... what?  What are the consequences of that?",
