      "text": "I am building a big project for Deno&#x2F;Node (compatible with both) and the project has different parts I would like to split into their own repos. I have never built a project as complex as this (nowhere near alpha release but 10K LOC as of right now). It is a passion and learning project of mine.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a way to split the monorepo into &quot;packages&quot; so that it&#x27;s easier to work on one area at a time, and also allows other devs in the future to work on it without having to git clone the whole repo.<p>I would also like to know if there&#x27;s a magic way to keep releases, version tags and such in sync between all the repos, so in the end it looks like a monorepo but allows for better modularity.<p>Turning it into a modular codebase is kind of important, because the project is able self-update modules (it has its own small package manager separate from NPM that downloads and installs tarballs)<p>What is your approach to the mono&#x2F;multirepo problem? Any advice, personal experiences you can share? Better to use git subtree or submodule?<p>Thanks in advance, fellow hackers!",

      "text": "So, let me preface this by saying that I think it&#x27;s possible to have a healthy discussion on this topic, and I am not trying to be overly judgmental of Substack.<p>But, I am genuinely curious why is it getting so popular and particularly here on Hacker News. Does it have some kind of a hidden feature that makes it very appealing?<p>My number one assumption would be that it uses a global userbase, so people who write on Substack can collect subscribers&#x2F;readers much faster. Is that all there is to it?<p>I also know that Substack prefetches an email address (once you enter it on any Substack-based site) and then plasters it on all their other customer sites, which I _really_ <i>hate</i> about their platform.<p>But I can see the appeal in that, I guess.",
