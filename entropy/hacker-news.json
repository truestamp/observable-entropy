      "text": "I like how the author of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz&#x2F; has created a huge online repo of bookmarks, links, knowledge, notes. The author claims to learn in public.<p>Are there more such examples of websites where the authors learn in the open and maintain such a website?<p>Is there a popular term to classify such websites? The website I&#x27;ve linked above claims to be a Wiki but I think it is very different from a Wiki. Wikis generally have an edit user interface to easily edit and maintain the wiki but the example above seems to be powered by Gitbook. I wonder if there is a separate term that classifies such websites?<p>Anyway getting back to the main point of this question... If you have examples of such websites where authors learn in the open, please share it here.",
