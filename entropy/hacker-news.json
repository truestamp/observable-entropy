      "text": "Here&#x27;s a very plausible threat: Some developer with a left-pad package, some dependency-of-a-dependency, injects malware into their library. A developer (who is broadly trustworthy) updates their package&#x27;s dependencies without auditing them properly, and the malware ends up in a VSCode plugin that you use. You open VSCode, your system is infected.<p>We know this sort of malware is making its way onto package repositories [1]. We know people are falling for these attacks. How do we protect ourselves against this family of threats?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;21&#x2F;npm_malware_password&#x2F;<p>We could trust nothing beyond our base system and our browser, and refuse to use any code we don&#x27;t fully audit, but this would be an impossibly austere way to live. I expect most of us, when pressed, would admit that we&#x27;re trusting much more code than we would like to.<p>The alternative is sandboxing, using a lightweight option like firejail (which I use) or a totalizing system like QubesOS. But these systems are awkward to use, and have their own drawbacks.<p>What&#x27;s the bar for reasonable security, in your opinion? How do you secure your workstation without living like a monk? Is there some convenient solution that I haven&#x27;t considered?",

      "text": "Long time lurker here. Just quit my job and thinking about how I should go about it.<p>Background: I have a degree in business administration, so not stem related at all. I have some money on side to live on for a around a year (more if I move back to my home 3rd world country). I consider myself tech-savvy (running Ubuntu then fedora for the last 10 years, build my own desktop).<p>The goal: finding a REMOTE job in IT&#x2F;software development as fast as possible. It does not have to pay much ($21k+ a year and I would sign), getting experience is the priority. Aiming for FAANG someday.<p>What I do know: Harvard CS50 10-15h a day. After that I will probably follow a Reddit thread suggesting CS61A&#x2F;CS61B&#x2F;CS61C from University of California, Berkeley. And finally Full Stack Open 2021 by University of Helsinki (gives certification).<p>As a hiring manager, would you hire me after all this if I have a mid-sized project matching your business?<p>Is there a database somewhere with a case study of digital startups? Wanting to create my own someday and that could really be handy.<p>Any advice would be appreciated, success or failure story also.<p>PS: If I have to go back to university, I will but prefer not to (cost is the real problem).",
