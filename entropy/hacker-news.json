      "text": "In my free time I am working on this application. I like the OSX Alfred a lot, I like it&#x27;s workflows a lot, but I miss it in Windows, and I do not like that it is not free. I have tested a lot of popular launchers, but everytime something was wrong(not crossplatform, does not have easy automation like workflows in Alfred, implemented in Electron). And at the end I desided to make my own. \nThe project is on very early development stage, that is why something may not work properly(but I hope it will), or not as fast as it should but I will try to develop the project to make it better.<p>I am not a C++ developer, that is why the code quality is not the best. The early version of the application was implemented in Java, and only after some time I decided to make it properly with C++. And wrote in C++ as in Java...and failed. That is why the project is a mess of code written in headers and cpp files. But I hope that at some time I will refactor it.<p>I am open to suggestions, bugs submitions and PRs.\nI am not a native English speaker, that is why sorry for grammar errors.",
