We tried many solutions over the years and apart from the long ago FB consumed and discarded drop.io, nothing fit our needs.\nHow we sell with Whatboard (at our sister company): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatboard.app&#x2F;b&#x2F;singleviewselling\nHow we delegate with Whatboard (at a related entity): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;whatboard.app&#x2F;b&#x2F;singleviewdelegation\nThank you in advance to anyone in the HN community interested in providing feedback, and to a certain 14 year old Gracklflint whose QA participation with our dev team made this even more enjoyable.",
