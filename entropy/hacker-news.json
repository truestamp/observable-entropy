      "text": "Hi.  Looking for help finding an open-source project (again).<p>Some time within the last ~6 months I came across a blog (or HackerNews) post about a piece of software (very likely a web app) that I found interesting and thought could be used for keeping track of small pieces of information (small text notes, book quotes, jokes, code snippets, CLI commands, …). It had a content area with multiple cards on the right, dark mode, list of tags&#x2F;filters on the left.<p>Looked somewhat similar to the screenshots [1] [2] [3] … the layout of the cards themselves had more details&#x2F;content from what I can remember. Also I&#x27;m quite sure besides tags it also had key-value attributes (like e.g. “author:Kipling”). It _might_ also have used individual markdown files as source for the content cards.<p>Now that I have some time to play with it, I can’t find it anymore.\nMaybe someone can help. Any ideas on what open-source project that is?\nOr some similar software that fits this use case (especially the individual markdown files feature)?<p>Things it&#x27;s not:  Notion, DailyNotes, Walling, pawelmalak&#x2F;snippet-box<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;pawelmalak&#x2F;snippet-box&#x2F;master&#x2F;.github&#x2F;img&#x2F;snippets.png\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.dribbble.com&#x2F;users&#x2F;2906169&#x2F;screenshots&#x2F;16279872&#x2F;media&#x2F;a74ab09ab4efd8e96aa9372f0a8d4cf3.png\n[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;camo.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;b42ba5ee9701f2bbedd5f1f7e6706f211591c8d59b061f8f2b86aba7b9e59816&#x2F;68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4a4b71486c68542e706e67",
