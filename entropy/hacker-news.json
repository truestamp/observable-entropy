      "text": "I moved to San Francisco after undergrad a few years ago to work at a unicorn as an engineer to learn with ambitions of doing my startup after a few years. I&#x27;ve ascended the ladder relatively quickly as the company has grown, but find myself increasingly bored with the work. I&#x27;m realizing it&#x27;s time to do something new, but I&#x27;m not totally sure where to start.<p>Where would one go in the Bay Area to meet other people that are interested in working on new projects or ventures? Do in-person forums for talking about interesting topics (and potentially working on them) exist in the city? Note that I explicitly didn&#x27;t say tech startups â€” I have pretty diverse interests, and I&#x27;d be very open to non-tech work, though tech startups are often interesting.<p>Apologies for this post being Bay Area-centric (though folks might have advice that generalizes).",
