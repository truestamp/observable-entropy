For some reasons, I cannot change jobs at the time being, and at the same time I&#x27;d need an extra income.<p>What are ways to leverage my ML&#x2F;NLP knowledge to earn extra money on the side? Ideally, something that doesn&#x27;t imply coding (unless it&#x27;s a one time thing to get some sort of passive income), since my main job already burns me out programming-wise. Could I get paid to give advice to startups? What about teaching (how and where)?<p>Thank you in advance!",
