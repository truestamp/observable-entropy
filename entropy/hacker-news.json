      "text": "Hi there,\nI&#x27;d like to build a full featured Reddit or Twitter clone with most of the common functionality. The requirement I have is that it needs to be production-ready. I also need things like image uploading, plans, stripe integration etc. \nIs there a low-code solution that you think that&#x27;d help me build the frontend and the backend?\nI just can&#x27;t find something that can really help with both frontend and backend.<p>I&#x27;m thinking something like retool (frontend) and firebase (backend) combo. Is that that route I should take?",
