      "text": "I&#x27;ve worked with different outliner apps: Dynalist, Workflowy, Omni Outliner, etc..<p>What I&#x27;m missing is a way to intuitively see at a glance for each collapsed item how much content it holds -- its &quot;weight&quot;, if you will.<p>For example, I&#x27;m imagining items that have few sub-items to be displayed with a low font-weight, and items that have a lot of sub-items with a strong font-weight. Or that each item displays a little circle next to it, bigger or smaller, depending on the size of the item&#x27;s content in relation to its siblings.<p>Do you know of any tool that does this?<p>I imagine that this would make it easier to &quot;balance out&quot; an outline, i.e. noticing which categories are just holding one or two items, and hence should better be merged with another category. This balancing aspect I find important for example when writing an outline for an article.",
