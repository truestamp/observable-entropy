      "text": "In short, I like my current company. There are some issues, and a bit of stress, but overall interesting work. I currently make what is considered to be &quot;average&quot; for my role in my area. Recently, I&#x27;ve gotten offers for similar roles with salaries 25r-35% higher than my current compensation. For context, I&#x27;ve had two large salary adjustments in the past quarter, but neither of those has put my comp on par with current offers. Have you ever left just for the money? Should I try to re-negotiate my current comp (that seems sort of poisonous&#x2F;dangerous)?",
