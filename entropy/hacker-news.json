      "text": "I&#x27;ve worked through thousands of hours of math courses in my life and am now embarking on an amateur study of logical reasoning, mostly through puzzle books and the Logic course on Brilliant.org.<p>Although in each math and logic course it&#x27;s easy to find explanations of the solutions, there is never any pedagogy surrounding the <i>methodology</i> to finding the solutions. The explanation of a problem solution given by a source often involves a key insight, but there&#x27;s never an explanation of how to reliably come up with key insights!<p>I&#x27;ve looked for tips and tricks, but the answer appears to be either &quot;do thousands of logic and math problems and gain an instinct for it&quot; or &quot;have any extremely high IQ&quot;.<p>Any thoughts?",
