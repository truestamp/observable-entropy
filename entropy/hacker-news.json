      "text": "I&#x27;ll be starting a CS PhD (specifically comp bio&#x2F;biomedical datascience) at Columbia this September and have been thinking a lot about what sort of workflow&#x2F;tech stack would be best to use during this period of time. I&#x27;ve only ever worked in academic research and haven&#x27;t always had the most structure which would usually resemble a waterfall type workflow.<p>So far I&#x27;m thinking kanban to organize ToDos, SciWheel for citation management, Evernote for general notetaking, overleaf for LaTeX, and Doom Emacs as an IDE all used in an Agile-esque way.<p>Are there any suggested organizational methods&#x2F;tools that you might recommend?",

Apple released 14.7 l, includes security fixes of known exploits â€¦ but does not fix security hole used by pegasus<p>3.  Apple introduced plans to locally scan files for CSAM.  Promises not to scan things other than photos and search terms.<p>4.  Apple releases 14.71 more security fixes.  However does not patch the iMessage flaw still in use by Pegasus.<p>Almost as if Apple is getting back door access ready for governments prior to patching known major security flaw in iMessage affecting hundred of thousands (perhaps millions) iPhones.  Security flaw that essentially openly exploits iMessage and breaks any local device encryption.",
