      "text": "Maybe this sentence sounds familiar for you as well: &quot;I have loads of bookmarked HN links.&quot;<p>Whenever I find time - this is my default productive procrastination action - I organize them even better or I start reading the content then reading all the comments. This process has few subsequent steps:\n- if new links, book references, etc. appear in the comments, I quickly skim them and, of course, add them to the bookmarks queue\n- I extract the main ideas from the article as well as all the info I want to retain from the comments and add them to a dedicated page in my personal Wiki (say it is an article about Productivity, I add all the new info in my Productivity wiki page if I have one, or create one if not\n- sometimes I create ANKI cards using the content, but not so often as creating good cards takes a lot of time (and this is actually the step I think has the most value out of the entire process)<p>Now the problem with all this is that is life consuming. I can&#x27;t do it properly and scale, I have many interests, therefore many bookmarks that keep piling up. I run a mid-size software development studio, have a newborn and have been diagnosed with ADHD, so all these being very impactful in my schedule, leading only to more bookmarks and frustration. I can&#x27;t convince myself to just delete all the bookmarks and unchain myself, although I thought about it few dozen times.<p>I am looking for your practical &#x2F; mental &#x2F; emotional approach on consuming HN as a source of inspiration for tampering with my own behavior.<p>Thank you!",
