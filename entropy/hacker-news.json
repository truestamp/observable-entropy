She is using an ad blocker (Adblock Plus on Safari) which does help with popups and advertising content but this often isn&#x27;t enough.  Any kind of motion on the page, while usually not enough to trigger a migraine, can be very distracting and frustrating for her.<p>Any suggestions on what she can try next?  Willing to switch browsers if necessary.  Thanks!",
