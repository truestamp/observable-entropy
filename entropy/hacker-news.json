      "text": "To be more specific, some exists, for example:<p>- Sails (MVC architecture)\n- Nest (gathering best tools and providing an architecture to use them together)\n- Blitz (Full stack React)<p>...But why none of them are getting a real traction while node.js is popular for many years now? Does people in the JS world usually prefer picking and connecting tools themselves?\nWhile I admit this philosophy can have benefits in some cases, it has true and obvious downsides too IMO.<p>I mean, in Python, you are able to chose your philosophy by picking up Django (all batteries included) or Flask (pick and connect tools of your choice). Both framework are kind of equally popular.<p>But I have the feeling if you decide to pick JS&#x2F;TS language (a good reason could be: you build a SPA and want to use only same language for back and front), the only viable option is the &quot;pick and connect tools of your choice&quot; philosophy.<p>I&#x27;m wondering why this is NOT a problem for most of developers I talk to. I think some of them has never deal with full featured framework like Django and don&#x27;t get all the benefits. But it can&#x27;t be the only explanation.",

Goes: preference and alternative, deal-breakers:\n1. SIM preferable, WiFi acceptible, but Bluetooth has to be good\n2. Spill and dust resistant keyboard that doesn&#x27;t feel like typing on nothing\n3. Trackpoint or trackpad, that works\n4. Stylus or touch-screen that doesn&#x27;t glare\n5. Good power management, lasts through the day, done charging in 2.5 hours\n6. Runs the hacky-mac or Slax, has a head-set jack\n7. Good GPU, fast storage, two fast external storage ports<p>From my understanding I fit a kind of profile, and am very much not alone. But I&#x27;d like to know what the HN crowd take on this is.",
