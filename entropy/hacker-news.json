      "text": "Hey all!\nlet&#x27;s say you have a lot data-sciency models in production (that for example forecast stuff) where each model relies on a bunch of hard-coded config parameters that you&#x27;ve found through some e.g. hyperparameter tuning etc. which you dont wanna rerun every time the production model runs. I end up hard-coding these values either directly in the production model code or put them in an enum&#x2F;json somewhere. \nHowever, I wish I had some &quot;config parameter management tool&quot; with a pretty GUI and API that allowed me to store the parameters in a central database which a few features:<p>- allow for programmatically writing new parameters<p>- allow the production models to programmatically query the parameters they&#x27;re supposed to use<p>- do versioning on the parameter sets, as it&#x27;s useful to keep the history of parameters for backtesting&#x2F;reporting<p>- have some logic of structuring the parameter sets thrugh grouping&#x2F;tagging and&#x2F;or a hierarchical model so all sets are not just one big mess<p>- finally allow of course for different parameter set structures, as different models have different parameters<p>- ideally a GUI<p>I didn&#x27;t manage to find anything like it online, are you aware of anything? How are you dealing with that topic if it&#x27;s an issue for you as well?<p>thanks a lot in advance!",
