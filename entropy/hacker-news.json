      "text": "Over the past few months, I’ve noticed a bunch of unexpected “likes” on my account. In my entire history on LinkedIn, I’ve quite literally never clicked the like button (intentionally, at least). Yet for some reason, I’m seeing a couple posts per week that I’ve supposedly liked. The posts are completely random things, most of which I’ve never even seen before. And the likes appear on my public profile for everyone else to see.<p>My first instinct is that it’s a UI&#x2F;UX issue. Specifically, I think my thumb might be grazing the like button as I scroll.<p>I’m tempted to think it’s more nefarious version of my instinct above (e.g. a subtle UI&#x2F;UX decision designed to increase engagement on the platform). But I know that’s unfair (don’t attribute to malice, etc).<p>Considering I’ve never experienced this type of issue on other social media sites, I thought I’d bring it up.<p>Has anyone else noticed this behavior, specifically on LinkedIn?",
