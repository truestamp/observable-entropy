      "text": "We&#x27;ve seen this week that Delta Airlines has made it mandatory for employees to be vaccinated or face a fine [1]. Other companies are also making this move or at least reporting vaccination status [2][3], spurred on by calls from politicians[4][5][6]. However there may be fall out from that [7].<p>Has your company made vaccination mandatory? If so, how has it been received from your point of view? If not, do you think your company will at some point make it mandatory?<p>If you have not been vaccinated but your company has made it mandatory, will you get it? If not, do you plan to leave?
