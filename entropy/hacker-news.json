      "text": "WebDataRocks finally presents new features with the 1.4 release. This pivot table is created by developers for developers, so it is an excellent choice as a software for data analysis. WebDataRocks pivot table is free and easy to integrate along with other useful features!<p>The main release improvement – framework wrappers for Vue, React and Angular. Just a few lines of code can elegantly and quickly embed WebDataRocks into your project. No extra time for integration with one of these JavaScript frameworks, just check the guides and here you are.<p>Along with improvements in the framework area WebDataRocks also cared for pivot customization: they added 3 new predefined themes. Now you can choose the most suitable theme for your design from the 8 offered.<p>Minor fixes were also done, read more at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webdatarocks.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;webdatarocks-1-4-release-new-long-awaited-features&#x2F;",

      "text": "I&#x27;m curious as to what do you think about the following situation, so I&#x27;ll present it as a timeline:<p>2016: I buy my first iPhone. Amazing piece of tech, does everything I want it to do. It just works.<p>2019: I buy a AirPods. They integrate amazingly with the phone. They just work.<p>2020: I want to release an iOS app, so I buy a Macbook Air (Intel, irrelevant). I like it (slim, long battery life, does what I need it to do, albeit somehow slow).<p>2020: I want to do more stuff on the Mac, including audio &#x2F; video calls. I buy a pair of jack earpods.<p>Now, I can&#x27;t use the AirPods all day because the battery just doesn&#x27;t handle it, understandably. I turn to the earpods. Decent sound, terrible microphone quality. These become a necessity as my app (and therefore business) grow bigger and bigger. One year later in 2021 I&#x27;m using the Mac camera and jack earpods, and I constantly get complaints either on video or audio quality from my microphone.<p>As a genuine question, how does Apple want me to deal with this situation? I paid somewhere around $2200 for this tech, should I not expect it to just work and do what it should do? How do you deal with this?",
