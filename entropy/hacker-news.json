      "text": "When Airbnb introduced Experiences - pivoting from being a marketplace of accomodations to accept all kinds of entertainment and activities, like boat trips, cooking courses, guided tours - I thought it would explode into commercialising whole ranges of human services, since these never had a good targeted platform before, these enterpreneurs promoted themselves mostly with social media pages and classical ads.<p>But the move did probably not work out - and as I see after the pandemic Airbnb tries to rather move into expensive&#x2F;special&#x2F;&quot;crazy&quot; accomodations instead. Do you have ideas what was the problem with this seemingly valid direction?",
