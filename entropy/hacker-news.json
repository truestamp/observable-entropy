How can I find someone there who I can talk to about the modern history of Spain and the Spanish Civil War? Other grad students, professors, historians? Anyone in Seville in academia? General advice to find people yo engage with in the field?<p>I am worried that isolation will be detrimental but I can&#x27;t seem to find a solution or platform to facilitate this.",
