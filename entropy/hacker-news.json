      "text": "I posted this on reddit over the weekend and had 179k views &amp; 2k upvotes. Someone mentioned I should also post on HN. Interested to see what you all think&#x2F;your ideas as well.<p>-<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking of putting together a book&#x2F;repo on the financial info&#x2F;lessons I wish I knew before entering tech. There is a lot of general information on financial advice, but very little tailored explicitly for tech employees. With so many jobs now paying $100k+ out of college, I thought - What financial info would I have wanted to know when I was jumping into tech?<p>With the correct information and execution, most of you can set yourselves up for a very comfortable life.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at a wide range of tech companies, running into most of the situations you will most likely encounter in your tech career. In the last decade, my income grew dramatically. When I joined Yelp early on, I made $30k base + stock options. At Netflix, my salary was over $300k.<p>Here&#x27;s everywhere I&#x27;ve worked -<p><pre><code>    Yelp (Pre-IPO)- joined @ 50-75 employees.\n\n    Redbeacon (joined @ 5 employees - acquired by Home Depot)\n\n    SimpleGeo (~20 employees - acquired by Airship)\n\n    Tindie (founded, raised VC, sold)\n\n    Netflix\n</code></pre>\nThings I wish I had known when entering the tech world -<p><pre><code>    Reviewing companies &amp; selecting the right opportunity\n\n    Salaries, pay raises, and how packages are structured\n\n        Startups vs big companies\n\n    Stock options vs RSUs - how they work, exercising them, the tax implications.\n\n    Bonuses - what to expect and also the tax implications\n\n    Investing in your retirement (401ks, IRAs, etc)\n\n    Real estate - renting in these high costs of living areas vs buying\n\n    Tech investing - becoming an angel investor &amp; VC investing\n\n    Contract work - how to bill &amp; taxes\n</code></pre>\nWhat else would you like to be covered?<p>I am going to write in public at this repo. Feel free to create an issue for a topic you&#x27;d like to see.<p>Repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;emilepetrone&#x2F;financial_advice<p>Mailing-list: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;financial.carrd.co&#x2F;<p>Hopefully, this will be helpful to everyone looking to jump into tech or are just starting their careers.",
