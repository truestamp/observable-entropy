      "text": "Greetings!<p>My name is Jeff, and I’m “early-access” launching my SaaS “serverless” infrastructure for Jamstack, games (particularly board games), and traditional real-time scenarios (presence, pub&#x2F;sub, etc…). This work is rooted in the frustration of building complicated board games using existing infrastructure. It just so happens that making board games easier has wide reaching implications.<p>Landing page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adama-platform.com&#x2F;<p>This is a radically different kind of “serverless” infrastructure where I want the benefits of both a serverless architecture with a monolithic mindset, and this is achieved by building a comprehensive language to transform documents within the service as close to data as possible with minimal reads and writes.<p>As this is “early access”, I’ve outlined the current challenges on the site and have a launch post which goes into more detail: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adama-platform.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;early-access-launch-and-confession.html<p>From a technical perspective, the now and future architecture has some interesting tidbits around streaming. However, the key value proposition is the language which I enjoy using (and building). This language has (1) await&#x2F;async semantics to perform coordination between multiple people, (2) integrated queries for simpler thinking about state, (3) privacy as a first class citizen, (4) access control is baked in, (4) reactive formulas which lazily compute values, (5) simple message passing between user and the document, (6) modern features which make doing bad things impossible, (7) state can be rewound with a rewind, (8) no need to serialize state or think about networking, and (9) more https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.adama-platform.com&#x2F;<p>I’ve got my work cut out for me, but I’m starting the effort to find early adopters and build community that want to play as I push forward on my strategy since many of my investments are driven by my pathologies: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adama-platform.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;24&#x2F;open-strategy.html<p>I would deeply appreciate any feedback, comments, and questions here, via my new shiny email: jeff@adama-platform.com, or my discord channel: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;W3Cj4By",
