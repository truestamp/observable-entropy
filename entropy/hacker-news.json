After placing the ad, I was immediately told, that the company can never post ads again without explanation.<p>After signing up to Stripe, verifying with my passport and selfies, they told me that the business account will be closed, stating they&#x27;ve &quot;identified a high volume of unauthorized charges on your account&quot;. There have been NO charges on that account.<p>Twitter also blocked my account there shortly after creating it.<p>Do you have any idea what might be causing this? It feels like because I&#x27;ve had no public profile on the internet ever, I am being penalised for finally having to join to market my business.",

Miles off?\nIf not how then did you budget for cloud costs? Or did you skip that and just see what happened?<p>Same question goes for the other clouds&#x2F;providers etc.<p>Thanks for your time!",
