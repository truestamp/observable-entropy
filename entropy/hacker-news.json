      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed that CJK fonts (MS Gothic, MS Mincho etc.) seem to have pixel-perfect rendering below a certain size. I would like to understand the mechanism by which this happens. I&#x27;m often frustrated by font anti-aliasing&#x2F;hinting at small sizes and I wonder if this rendering trait could somehow be transplanted to a programming focused font.<p>I&#x27;m aware there are lots of other ways to achieve pixel perfect font rendering, but I&#x27;m drawn to this property of CJK fonts because it seems to &quot;just work&quot; in all sorts of situations.<p>In any case, my google-fu is too weak for me to find a definitive answer to this, hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Thanks.",
