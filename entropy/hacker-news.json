      "text": "I am building a big project for Deno&#x2F;Node (compatible with both) and the project has different parts I would like to split into their own repos. I have never built a project as complex as this (nowhere near alpha release but 10K LOC as of right now). It is a passion and learning project of mine.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a way to split the monorepo into &quot;packages&quot; so that it&#x27;s easier to work on one area at a time, and also allows other devs in the future to work on it without having to git clone the whole repo.<p>I would also like to know if there&#x27;s a magic way to keep releases, version tags and such in sync between all the repos, so in the end it looks like a monorepo but allows for better modularity.<p>Turning it into a modular codebase is kind of important, because the project is able self-update modules (it has its own small package manager separate from NPM that downloads and installs tarballs)<p>What is your approach to the mono&#x2F;multirepo problem? Any advice, personal experiences you can share? Better to use git subtree or submodule?<p>Thanks in advance, fellow hackers!",
