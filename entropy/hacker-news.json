      "text": "Me and a few friends have been working multy.dev, an open-source cloud agnostic API that makes it easy to deploy the same infrastructure to any cloud provider using native managed services.<p>The motivation was the realisation that, even when using Terraform, migrating infrastructure code requires an end-to-end re-write. Even though most core resources are the same in any major cloud, developers need to learn a new provider to deploy the same infrastructure when moving providers.<p>We currently support:<p>- Networking (virtual_network, subnet, route_table, security_group, network_interface, public_ip)<p>- Compute (virtual_machine, managed kubernetes)<p>- Database (managed MySQL databases)<p>- Vault (managed secrets)<p>- Storage (managed storage)<p>- Abstraction cloud differences (Azure VM public vs AWS EC2 private by default)<p>- Deployment through Terraform<p>We are in very early days of development, supporting core services from AWS and Azure at a high-level. Weâ€™re looking for feedback from developers about our approach and messaging.<p>&gt; multy.dev",
