      "text": "I have two personal computers and one work laptop, all of which have similar development environment but not the same. One personal computer runs windows, the other two Ubuntu.<p>Since I knew that I will be using different IDEs and environments, I decided to learn vim and use vim bindings in all my IDEs to ensure some sort of similarity across all my development environments, but it doesn&#x27;t cover it all. I&#x27;ve also tried manually migrating my home directory between different computers, but that comes with several issues, primarily that I&#x27;d have to try to share it between professional and personal computers. \nSo what I&#x27;m left with is basically remembering what I&#x27;m using, and then tediously spend a day or more re-configuring newly installed computers with the software and configurations I know I&#x27;m using. It feels like I have to throw away my perfectly configured hammer which I know by heart and get a new one every time I work at a different workplace instead of bringing it along and perfecting it further. Surely there&#x27;s a better way.<p>How do you keep your development environments&#x2F;ways of working synced and backed up?",
