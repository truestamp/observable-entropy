      "text": "Hey all, I am Sandeep. I am from Kolkata, India.\nI am currently working for one of the biggest e-Sports companies based in Los Angeles, USA.<p>I have been working remotely since 2018 and it has enabled me to level up my developer journey. In 2021, I am able to earn 7x of what I was making in 2018, all thanks to remote work.<p>The current scenario of finding a remote job is pretty difficult.\nAll the remote job boards are either too colourful or very hard to browse.<p>That&#x27;s why I started a side project of mine, it&#x27;s called https:&#x2F;&#x2F;remotefront.io I am building this for the last year. As a remote worker myself, I tried to solve my own problems with this project.\nIt has been able to collect 2500+ remote jobs from the Internet in the last 28 days.<p>It aggregates remote jobs from 10+ popular remote job boards and provides a cleaner way of browsing.<p>Every Monday &amp; Thursday it will send you a list of remote jobs that match your preferences.<p>It frees up your time and hunts remote jobs for you in async.<p>I am looking for feedback and criticism.",
