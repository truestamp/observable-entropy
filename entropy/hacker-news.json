I have had very severe allergic reactions to different vaccines and medications in the past which required hospitalization due to hives and difficulty breathing&#x2F;swallowing.<p>How can I keep my job, work in the office (wearing a mask), and not have to receive a vaccine which is (based on previous medical history) a high risk of being dangerous to me?",
