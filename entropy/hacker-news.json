      "text": "I am the founder of a P2P sports and social betting platform that allows friends and strangers to bet real money on sports, politics, pop culture, and other events electronically. Think of it as a more interactive version of Venmo, with a focus on betting: the ultimate &quot;put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is&quot; platform.<p>I am looking to hire a full-stack Lead Software Engineer who will be the first full-time technical hire at our company. This person would have equity in the company and would lead the future tech team. Our company has a beta app launched and is currently raising our first round of outside capital.<p>Our tech stack is as follows:\nBack-End = Laravel Framework: PHP&#x2F;SQL\nFront-End = Flutter (though we’re in the process of moving to React)<p>This is a high risk&#x2F;reward situation, but there&#x27;s a ton of upside here. This space is booming and I truly think we can turn this into a $100mm+ exit.<p>If interested in hearing more, please email support@kutt.com.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kutt.com",
