      "text": "I recently launched my first Indiegogo campaign today, and one of the cool things about the campaign is the use of NFTs.<p>Two of the rewards would be the chance to own one of the 54 NFTs which would be minted. The 54 NFTs will be a collage of 54 dishes from 54 African countries.<p>54 because there are currently 54 countries in Africa. (Yup you guessed right, the campaign is about something related to Africa)<p>Please check out the campaign here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;igg.me&#x2F;at&#x2F;dishafrik any support is appreciated.<p>Also, if you have any question, feel free to leave them in the comments. I will be happy to answer.",
