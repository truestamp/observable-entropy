My intuition is that the smart thing to do right now is one of: (1) take large pay packages at more established tech companies, (2) negotiate substantial equity comp if you really want to join an early stage company, or (3) be a founder or founder-adjacent.",

      "text": "Relocating to the US at 24 years of age was not only exhausting but also chaotic. It included weeks and weeks searching for accommodations before the move, followed by the culture shock of being in a totally new place.<p>Does every student experience the same with relocation? The more people I spoke to, the more my suspicions were confirmed.<p>A lot of great ideas start from a place of empathy, and that is exactly how Setlor began. It started as 4 years ago brainstorming in a dorm room on a piece of paper to using Figma to designing #UI&#x2F;UX, using emails to communicate to shifting communications on Slack, using Google sheets to address bugs to manage the entire project on ClickUp. Knowing nothing about the software development to finally evolving into what we’ve wanted it to be.<p>setlor is what I’d like to call the guardian I wished I had when I first moved here. The app is solely dedicated to finding your preferred accommodation and roommate so you can ease into the process of relocating. Setlor narrows down your available housing options according to the universities you choose and connects you to people looking for the same. Setlor currently has 10 universities listed on the app. You can comment below if you’d like to add your university to the list. Help us help you relocate with ease.<p>know more: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.setlor.com&#x2F;<p>iOS: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lnkd.in&#x2F;escT9yp Android: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lnkd.in&#x2F;e6mrFTj",
