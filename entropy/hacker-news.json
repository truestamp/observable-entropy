      "text": "Hi guys,<p>I&#x27;m looking for companies that offers Natural Language Generation technology. This is what I need to do: starting from structured data (time-series, records) about some past, current and forecasted phenomena of a specific field, I&#x27;d like to see whether some narrative, in English, can be automatically generated but in a way that does look linguistically rich and semantically grounded. I already tested out some rule-based systems, but they lack the afore mentioned characteristics.<p>Do you guys know of such companies? I would skip research institutions providing pieces of software: I&#x27;m more looking into already built products.<p>Thanks a lot!",
