      "text": "Apple terminated my developer account for the association with a previously terminated account.<p>First I should say: I &amp; my developer account are not associated with anyone else in any way since May 2018.<p>From this, I feel I’m fully innocent.<p>My Apple developer account is my only job and I’ve put blood and sweat there, I appreciate any advice. Thank you.<p>More details:<p>Apple fully terminated my developer account of 5 years because they determined it’s associated with some terminated account. However, immediately they gave me another chance to re-instate it. They gave me a chance to write a letter and explain why Apple should give me my developer membership back.<p>Here I’m asking for your advice. I already sent them an email and explained everything, but I think I can add more information. Is there a way I can call them? My account is not accessible at all.<p>This is the latest letter I’ve sent to them: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;MMWq87X<p>My association with a terminated account lasted until May 12, 2018, the day I removed my Apple ID there. Also one of my bank accounts has been there until July 2017. I uploaded one app there 7 years ago and on May 12, 2018, I removed it, that’s all!\nI believe this account is terminated about a year ago, so almost 3 years after I’ve had any association with it.<p>Of course, they gave me an appeal chance before as well, but my appeal wasn’t successful! I told them the same things that I said here( but with details), except I have had forgotten about the Apple ID thing. But in my last letter, I also told them that my Apple ID has been there until May 2018. Since my previous appeal and my last letter are not much different, I see a low chance for my case.<p>I think they shouldn&#x27;t even flag my account since my association has been very weak and it has been from the distant past.<p>I believe my account terminated using robots with no human interactions, I believe no human even read my previous appeal.<p>Thanks for reading.",
