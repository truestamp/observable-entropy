      "text": "Dear HN,<p>I just saw the news that Intel is EOL-ing RealSense. Let&#x27;s hypothetically say I have custom hardware prototypes, drivers, and some example AIs for a replacement product. So far, it&#x27;s only been used internally where it enabled new AI research. But how would I go about turning the camera itself into a proper product?<p>Obviously, there&#x27;s startup incubators and venture capital firms. For example, I&#x27;m aware of Y-Combinator (surprise!) and the Sony Innovation Fund. The latter apparently seeks to invest into AI and Vision technologies. Also, those hardware prototypes just so happen to include Sony sensors.<p>But if the product already exists and is proven to work and to solve a real and valuable problem, it would be quite risky to just show the solution to angels, investors, incubators, or VCs. On the other hand, nobody&#x27;s going to &quot;buy&quot; the cat in the bag.<p>My preliminary research suggests that it&#x27;ll cost $10k to $20k to submit a patent draft. And one should probably at least cover hardware, software, drivers, and derived AI models, meaning probably around $60 to $80k in legalcosts. So that leads to a chicken and egg problem. You need money to pay for IP protection, but you&#x27;ll need that IP protection to raise money.<p>What&#x27;s the solution?",
