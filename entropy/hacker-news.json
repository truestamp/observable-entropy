      "text": "I am concerned about my privacy on the internet and i think using cdn&#x27;s for data that is very common and often reused - such as fonts - opens a huge door to user tracking.<p>In a short research i did not find a browser plugin to replace online font cdn&#x27;s with locally cached fonts. I wanted to open a discussion about the feasability, problems, ideas and interest in such a plugin.<p>If you think this is a good idea and you&#x27;d love to work on it, you are very welcome to &quot;steal&quot; it. I will hardly be able to work on it myself in the near future.",
