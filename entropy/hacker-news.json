The main feature is that you can throw together custom views out of existing data very quickly and then serve them from a unique url.<p>The view is available in either plain HTML that prints (or prints-to-pdf) cleanly or as a JSON object that has all the same info.<p>Is this something that other people might use?",

Since this is a common problem which others will also face, let&#x27;s compile a list which people can draw on for inspiration.<p>Two examples I&#x27;m particularly fond of:<p>- GitLab Issue Filters. The user is seamlessly guided by suggestions (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;gitlab-org&#x2F;gitlab&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues)<p>- AdminColumns Wordpress List table Filters. As with GitLab, the user is seamlessly guided by suggestions. Next to that, I&#x27;m a big fan of how the filter get translated into a human-readable description after being created.
