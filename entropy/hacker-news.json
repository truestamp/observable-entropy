In that menu you can download offline map without signing in. To manage your offline maps download a second region at random. While downloading you will notice the download in your Android notification drawer. Click on the download and cancel it. You can manage your other downloaded regions from here. There is no other way to access this menu unless you are signed in. However, with my method you don&#x27;t need to sign in to the maps app ever. Thank you to whoever built the app without explicitly requiring Google Play services as well. I owe you a drink.",
