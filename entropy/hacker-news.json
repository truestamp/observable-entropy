      "text": "I am thinking of using a password manager. I am having trouble to trust these managers. My fear is that a password manager becomes a single point of vulnerability.<p>Here is an idea to protect passwords.<p>Say I want to store the password: ykT%mK#5 (just an example). Instead of storing it as is. I would apply the following algo:<p>1. Reverse letters<p>2. Add character at 5th position (1 based indexing)<p>So the stored password becomes: 5#Kmd%Tky (added letter d)<p>The above is a sample algo. But I think this it is easier to remember algo (It is like your own simple encryption function). One can have different algos for different categories e.g Banks, Email, Github, Office, etc<p>Question: Does this strategy make storing things in Password Manager more secure in case its compromised?",
