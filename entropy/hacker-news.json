      "text": "A start up is very keen to hire me and are planning on making an offer. I am not being grandiose in saying I would be a good catch for them (they know it and I know it).<p>My position at present is that I very much enjoy my current job, they are very good at rewarding me and give a good level of autonomy to run my engineering team that I acquired and grew myself. I don&#x27;t have anything to lose here, only (potentially) gain.<p>However the start up is pretty exciting and I know I could achieve a lot there. I would really enjoy the challenge.<p>However, the real aspect that would make the difference for me is company stock, to the point that if they sell the company I won&#x27;t have to worry about paying off the mortgage on my house and get a decent slice for retirement and my kids education.<p>Now to my question, I am don&#x27;t know jack about working out what would be a good amount of stock to shoot for. How would I go about establishing this? I figure I need to work out what the company could be worth and then consider what a percentage of options would provide.<p>Anyone have any experience they could share?",
