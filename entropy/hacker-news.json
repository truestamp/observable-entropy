You think this is in good faith, when you could just spend 0.2 seconds to click the link right below the widget to go right to the official website to do it more directly? I bet Google scrapes the tracking number &amp; uploads the tracking data directly to the Megacluster to further  train the Grid so it Can Serve You Better (TM)",
