      "text": "I can read less text content easily. my way of reading it is to make slides of all those texts and learn from the slides.<p>But I have issue with reading huge huge texts as you know in this case it will require too much time when I do this. Is there way to simplify this reading style?<p>eg-: of sth that I want to read is this.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;research.google.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;&#x2F;archive&#x2F;gfs-sosp2003.pdf<p>It takes me 45 minutes to read 3 paragraph and comprehend it at least.<p>If I go that way, you can imagine, how long it takes me to read a research paper. Probably a week to read a research paper lol. Even reading articles in internet is a hassle for me if they are longer. If I just read what I need to learn it is easy as it will be few paragraphs but if I have to learn sth else long it is pain to me as I can&#x27;t do it timely manner.<p>Are there any udemy courses that teach how to read textbooks for university students that you are aware of?",
