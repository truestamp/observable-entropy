I was talking to my new boss and he said that I was &quot;mostly chosen&quot; because of my &quot;outstanding GitHub profile&quot;. I don&#x27;t have a problem with this, I willingly filled out a form with a link to my GitHub profile when I applied. But what makes an &quot;outstanding GitHub profile&quot;? I have 500 or so followers. My projects are mostly libraries, in either Python or Javascript. The most popular ones have a few hundred stars. One has over 1000. Is this really the industry standard? Do employers really just say &quot;they have a good GitHub presence, hire them&quot;? I know I could script the stars and followings if I wanted, just give me my morning coffee and 24 hours and you&#x27;ll have yourself a well paying software position ;)",
