For a number of reasons, we recently decided to pivot.<p>We&#x27;re developing a unique product for a small, growing, market we love: async-first communication (understand documentation + discussions).<p>Our success will massively rely on growing our (free) beta waitlist:\n1. Bringing design partners on board and iterate with them on new releases\n2. Hoping this will lead to a big public launch<p>→ Do any of you have experience building beta waitlists? How would you approach that in our context?<p>Thanks, and looking forward to reading your thoughts!<p>@clementrog",
