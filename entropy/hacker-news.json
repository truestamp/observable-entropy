      "text": "Hi HackerNews!<p>Need to get back in a rhythm for the reopening? We’re Gokul, @dhanush_rad, and @ peteturnbull from www.demigod.ai - we were inspired by atomic habits to build the system for progressing towards your goals.<p>As founders and creators with unstructured time, ambitious goals, and an uncertain journey, we really needed a system to guarantee consistent progress and avoid random procrastinating. We found James Clear’s https:&#x2F;&#x2F;expertprogrammanagement.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;book-summary-atomic-habits-clear&#x2F; and it just clicked.<p>With the pandemic and shutdown, everyone’s regular routines were thrown completely off. We were forced to think about what we had been doing and if it resonated with our real goals versus what addiction engineering https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;naval&#x2F;status&#x2F;1084739181593559040?s=20 was prescribing. With the upcoming reopening we want to help you architect your system with intention.<p>We’re adding the levers to make it easy to be intentional with your time and make sure you hit your goals. We built our habit tracker into GCal because we realized it’s the de facto way we think about our time. We’ve added weekly data summaries, habit progress data, friend challenges, completion wagers, and most importantly - a human planning assistant to review your data and plan your next week.<p>Step 1: Describe your objectives\n* Set personalized goals or just set up a comfortable daily flow\nStep 2: Add habits\n* Sleep - A consistent bedtime schedule is a keystone habit for wellness\n* Reading - It&#x27;s hard to pick up a book, so find something you like and start with 1 page\n* Meditation - A minute a day keeps founders in play\n* Deep Work&#x2F;Emails - Whether it&#x27;s inbox 0, outbound targets, or lines of code. Make sure you don&#x27;t miss a day.\n* Daily Exercise - Always sounds like a good idea but a huge workout can be daunting, we&#x27;ll find something you love and make it easy\n* Free Time - Been stuck in a work&#x2F;life purgatory? Finish the important stuff and make time to step away\n* Planning Session - Crucial for making sure you&#x27;re actually doing what needs to get done, and stepping away afterwards\nStep 3: Make them atomic\n* Start with the smallest unit of progress for each habit you create. Shape your environment, stack habits, and reward completions. \nStep 4: Set up your system\n* Add you friends for accountability to build durable streaks\n* Weekly check-ins to increment, decrement, remove, or create habits\n* Easy resets for when you fall off<p>Book an onboarding call https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;dianapiktel or check it out on the app store https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;demigod&#x2F;id1501287553 and let us know what you think!",
