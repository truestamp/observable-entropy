      "text": "This post was on the front page a few days and really resonated with me [1]. I love HN, because there is nowhere else on the internet with the same concentration of intelligence, deep knowledge and mature perspective on things.<p>However like the author I’ve noticed myself becoming increasingly cynical about tech, and the world. This is a very bad attitude to have for any startup ambitions, where optimism (bordering on irrationality) is necessary to succeed. So I want to start reading other things more often.<p>What other communities are there that are more optimistic, but still have a similar level of intelligence, experience etc?<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kg.dev&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;i-love-you-hn-but-youre-toxic",
