(Our app is translated in 40+ languages). It had been the same for 4+ years but suddenly someone wrote a bot to just remove all apps that didn&#x27;t pass that guideline without any email notification.\nWe modified the metadata, appealed and resubmitted and our app was re-added with reviews with a 7 days downtime costing us thousands of dollars in revenues. The level of stress was VERY HIGH.\nYesterday again our app was removed.\nThis time the culprit guideline is not providing email&#x2F;password for the reviewers to use.\nThe app has been the same for 9 years.\nSomeone added that to the guidelines 2+ years ago.\nAnd then now someone wrote a bot to enforce that.\nThe bot just removes the apps without any warning.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear.\nI&#x27;m not against the guidelines. The problem is there are 100+ pages of guidelines and they get updated all the time.\nEngineers at the Google Play Store need to STOP IMMEDIATELY this kill-bots that ban straight away without an email notification.\nPlease build in a grace period where you notify developers 1-4 weeks before you are going to remove their apps.<p>BUT WE WARNED YOU IN THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE CONSOLE...\nWe don&#x27;t check the Google Play Store Console very often and pretending millions of developers to be on the edge all the time reading manuals of dozens of pages updated monthly and checking compulsively UIs warning that matters once a year is just a cruel dystopia.<p>Please stop the killbots and add the warn-bots followed by killbots.\nThis bots have seriously damaged the brand of Google in my eyes and have forced us to change marketing strategy from the app stores to SEO&#x2F;content marketing to be less dependent on the whims of bots developers.",
