      "text": "Hello HN !<p>This is my first post, (long time &#x27;lurker&#x27;) I decided to show you my weekend project (≈20h of work).<p>Websitehunt.co\nThe best websites you didn&#x27;t know.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.websitehunt.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.websitehunt.co</a><p>It is basically a newsletter where you receive the most upvoted websites each week.<p>The websites submitted have to &quot;stand alone&quot;, like tools. It generally cannot be a landing page for an app and such.<p>If you know a cool little known website, this is the place to add it ! Autopromotion is welcomed.<p>The submission are queued and 10 websites of the queue are released each day. I think this is good for the UX.<p>The concept is old and very simple. It is just a ProductHunt for websites, but I think people will be interested, ( I am and was before building it ).",
