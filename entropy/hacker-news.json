      "text": "For the past 2 months I&#x27;ve been struggling to hire a web designer to create a website for me. I wrote the entire product specification, all screens and app flows, and I want a designer to take that spec and turn it into a real product design.<p>Attempt #1: Direct hire<p>Posted a local job and hired a person based on their portfolio. We signed the contract, and they started the project. 2 weeks later I check in and all they have done is the color palette and fonts. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m unreasonable when I say this is way too little work for 2 weeks booked at 8 hours &#x2F; day. I closed the contract afterwards and I consider I simply got scammed. Am I being unreasonable here?<p>Attempt #2: Upwork<p>I posted my project on Upwork for a fixed price, estimated at 300 hours and with a price per hour that matches what Upwork says is their &quot;top freelancers&quot;. I received more than 100 applications in the first 3 hours. Looking at their past work and portfolio, I notice a lot of them have linked the same projects, with the same screenshots and project description. I closed the project after I saw that, fearing another scam.<p>Attempt #3: LinkedIn<p>Posted a job for a contract-based short term project. I received less than 20 applicants in a week, and most of them sent me 5 page CVs without a portfolio. The portfolios that I got from the rest of them were very slim, presenting 1-2 project mockups which could barely be called projects, even though they called themselves experienced professionals.<p>I&#x27;m currently out of ideas on what to try next. I&#x27;m willing to pay top money for top work, and I mentioned this in every job ad, but for some reason all I get is scam attempts or homework projects.<p>Do you have some advice on how to hire high quality designers? Is there something wrong that I&#x27;m doing here?",
