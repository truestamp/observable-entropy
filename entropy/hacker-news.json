I&#x27;d love to take advantage of this freedom and travel the world working remotely and living off income from my startup, but don&#x27;t want to do it alone (just because it would be safer, save money and be more fun&#x2F;less lonely). Looking for another founder (ideally female) or engineer&#x2F;other remote worker who is in a similar situation and would like to explore the world (or a few places with me). If interested, email me manisha[at]modulo[dot]app",
