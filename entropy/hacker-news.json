      "text": "After Apple betrayed my trust by announcing they are going to install malware on my phone, I have taken some actions &quot;against&quot; them and other big tech companies.<p>1) Deleted all apps which are not absolutely essential to me. Realized that for most of them the website functions perfectly well.\n2) Ordered for a basic Android phone. After a 7 day wait period, I am going to root it and install Lineage OS+microg on it.\n3) I have 2 iphones which I am not going to sell, as I consider it unethical to impose Apple&#x27;s policies on the buyer.\n4) Donated 200 USD to FSF.\n5) Signed up with posteo and am going to use their e-mail service from now on - already migrated 90% from Gmail and the entire process should take a month.\n6) Going to remove Windows from all my laptops tomorrow and replace them with GNU&#x2F;Linux.<p>Some inconveniences I will face\na) not sure how some essential apps I need will work with Lineage. Need to figure out alternatives, which I will.\nb) will never play a PC game again - as an introvert and loner, games have been very important for my mental health. But removing Windows is even more important.<p>Would love to hear more ideas from the community on actions I can take to help free software (not open source) and reduce the power of big tech.",
