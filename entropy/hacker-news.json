      "text": "Hello everyone, I&#x27;m a maintainer at the PixiJS project. I fix bugs very often and to do so I have to setup a reproduction of the bug locally - that usually means copying code from an online IDE and linking it to the local build of PixiJS. I thought this process could be automated, and I wanted to know how useful it would be for other people.<p>Example command: fiddle download &lt;URL&gt;<p>This command would setup a mini webpack project, possibly linked to local builds of any dependencies (otherwise, downloaded using npm). You can run the project using another command like &quot;npm run start&quot;.<p>If you think this is useful, would you pay and how much?",
