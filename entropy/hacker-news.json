      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>I teach CS courses at university and used GitHub Classroom for the purpose of creating the student repos.<p>I just wanted to warn anyone who&#x27;s teaching, this product is not ready for usage yet.<p>- Currently, the page that lists all the students in my class is unaccessible (gives 500 server error). This means I can&#x27;t add or remove students from the class, not even view them. GitHub support acknowledged the issue and says they&#x27;re working on it.<p>- Setting a deadline for assignments just does nothing - the deadline is in no way enforced or even checked. Students can just keep pushing even after the deadline has passed.<p>- This is the worst one: I used GitHub Classroom to create repos for student group projects. Of course I was thinking that the students would only get access to their own repo, for their group. But no, Classroom will add the students as <i>members to your GitHub organization</i>, giving them <i>access to all private repos</i> in your org. In my case, this included solutions to the assignments.<p>How the product could ship in this state is beyond me.",
