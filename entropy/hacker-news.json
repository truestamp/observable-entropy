I would be able to get into CAD&#x2F;mathematical programming a bit more easily as that is what I&#x27;m working on currently, but that is not a requirement at all. I&#x27;m also interested in simulations, network programming and nifty Linux tools like terminal emulators, window managers (though I do not know much about them). Thanks in advance!",
