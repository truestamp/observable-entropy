      "text": "I&#x27;ve read every possible thread here and in Reddit regarding Electron. I&#x27;m perfectly aware of the drawbacks and reasons people hate Electron. But nevertheless lets bring this topic one more time and this time try to focus on a real example (mine) rather than hypothetical discussion.<p>I have an idea for an application. It a desktop application. So I&#x27;m not porting it from web app nor I plan to make it a web app any time in the future. It being a desktop app is my first selling point.<p>My second selling point is it being as snappy and as productive as possible. Therefore I try to focus much on keyboard shortcuts, intuitive UI&#x2F;UX (even though its incredibly hard for me since I&#x27;m a developer and not UI&#x2F;UX engineer).<p>I&#x27;m perfectly aware of proper separation between business logic and presentation layer, know how to use FFI, IPC and other methods to call from UI to a shared BL.<p>And last but not least - I&#x27;m a solo developer. With 0$ funding. Doing this in my free time and eager to make money from it and reach as bigger audience as possible.<p>Now, given all that, lets try to evaluate my options.<p>1) Non native cross platform frameworks. This includes QT, JavaFX&#x2F;Swing, Flutter and others. While they are probably more snappier than Electron apps, you can&#x27;t really call them native. A lot of the criticism of Electron in terms of UI&#x2F;UX, can be directed at those as well.<p>2) Native. This means I need to develop at least 2 different UIs to capture 98% of the market, and being a former Linux user and understanding the struggle of lack of good apps in Linux, I can&#x27;t ignore that platform. So 3 times the development time, 3 times the bug fixes, 3 times the support.<p>3) Electron. We all know this one.<p>While I agree that big companies like Slack, Microsoft or Spotify can (and should) invest money in proper app development for each platform; solo developers like me, rarely have the luxury to do so. So I&#x27;m left with either choosing one platform to focus on (in my case its Mac since I&#x27;m a Mac user) and ignoring all others (at least for now) or settle on semi-native solutions.<p>I&#x27;m a perfectionist and I have a vision. But because I&#x27;m a power user, doesn&#x27;t mean everybody else is like me. So to all the people who say that Electron is not native and breaks their UI&#x2F;UX - is this really an issue among non power users, or is it just us, developers, being frustrated (and I share this frustration) over minor issues like keyboard shortcuts or lack of native Mac text fields?",
