      "text": "Hi all,<p>so it is clear that soft delete hard to implement correctly and \nin general it is evil. \nUsually the main reason for it is to preserve referenced data.<p>For example we have invoice and customer. We want to see this \nrelation even if customer was deleted.<p>One of the approach is the customer snapshot stored in the \ninvoice object. I want to discuss this approach.<p>So imagine we have have such invoice with customer snapshot, and \ninvoice is editable (not paid). What if I want to update customer&#x27;s \nname? I will update name in snapshot? In original record? Both?<p>It is interesting to hear your thoughts.",
