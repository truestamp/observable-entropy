      "text": "When starting the project eight months ago I did not think that the hardest part of the starting a business would be the customer acquisition. I thought it would be technical challenges, design of the app, testing, etc... imagining that once launched the customers would pour in. Boy was I wrong!<p>So, the app ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cogency.io ) is launched! Now what? How do you let the world know that you had created a .. in your mind.. &quot;kick-ass&quot; service? Here are the attempts<p>Google Ads - Failed w&#x2F; a few signups but none converted into paying customers<p>Mass mail - Sent approx. 100K emails that unfortunately b&#x2F;c of the shady email service we used ( not mentioning their name not to give them more publicity ) that prob was already blacklisted...so from 100K, 30+K bounced and the other 60+K emails most likely ended in peoples&#x27; spam folders and thus were never opened. I am deducing this from the fact that I received ZERO signups.<p>Tried email some business folks directly ( as a personal email ) asking them to check out my app and possible give some feedback ( preferably critical ) ... nothing either.<p>Started posting on twitter, but I just try to be positive about what I post. I did come across some successful strategies where the folks just keep &quot;bitching&quot; about how hard it is with their startups .. but I do not want pity.. I think I have a good enough product that would benefit a lot of people!<p>So, the question is.. how do you get the world to get to know you w&#x2F;out sinking huge amounts of cash into advertising?<p>Seems like a herculean task!",
