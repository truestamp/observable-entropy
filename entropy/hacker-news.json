      "text": "My long-time ISP and VOIP provider is turning off my DSL circuit next month, and I&#x27;ve been in the process of migrating to a new ISP and need a new VOIP provider.<p>There is a vast array of VOIP providers with many different service plans, features and pricing structures.<p>Since this isn&#x27;t an area where I&#x27;m an SME, I&#x27;ve searched around quite a bit, but am a little overwhelmed by the number and type of services available.<p>At a minimum, I need to be able to make and answer actual phone calls with my existing VOIP number and forward incoming calls to my (also existing) mobile number.<p>The various &quot;standard&quot; features:<p>1. Call forwarding after $X rings<p>2. Access&#x2F;use via mobile device<p>3. Inbound&#x2F;outbound international (I&#x27;m in the US) calls (both when I&#x27;m in the US and outside of it.<p>Those would be useful, but all I really <i>need</i> is call forwarding and calling worldwide from inside the US.<p>It would also be useful to be able to manage my own VOIP-enabled desk&#x2F;cordless phone (perhaps through something like Asterisk[0]), but that&#x27;s not strictly necessary.<p>Ideally, it would be great if it were free, but that&#x27;s not strictly necessary either.  I started looking at Google Voice (which doesn&#x27;t provide all the features listed above, but as I said, I only <i>need</i> inbound&#x2F;outbound calling and call-forwarding).<p>That said, I try to stay as far away from Google as possible whenever I can.<p>What sorts of experience have other folks had with  various VOIP providers?<p>What sorts of provider&#x2F;feature recommendations would you make toward enhancing privacy and security for VOIP services?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asterisk.org&#x2F;<p>Edit:  Added the <i>missing link</i>.",
