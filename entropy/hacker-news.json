      "text": "This was part of a code review in a small project in Go:\n&#x27;You did not apply SOLID principles and no extensibility&#x27;.<p>At this point I&#x27;ve seen this kind of feedback one too many so, given that I&#x27;m just a click away from giving the whole current SW dev party the middle finger and do something more productive with my life, I&#x27;d just want to see if I&#x27;m alone in feeling that:<p>1. cargo-culting (uncle Bob et all) has poisoned the field to the point of destroying even unrelated paradigms (at this point I won&#x27;t be impressed if someone tries to apply SOLID to Elixir)<p>2. SW eng roles are gatekeeped (this was a take home test) by evangelists of a certain type that make sure that things will keep being done in that way.<p>3. That way being the way Java ecosystem made sure that nobody with a creative vein and a slight aversion to authorities and bureaucracy would ever set foot in it again. Consistently delivering overengineered BS that build nice CVs and careers and leave companies with unmaintainable overengineered messes.<p>4. There is yet a shred of actual damned scientific evidence that all this 90s and 00s &quot;best practices&quot; actually lead to better SW. There has been no double blind experiment to measure whether the SOLID principles actually work or their best use is to insure a fat paycheck for evangelists and build CVs. For the record I conside most of SOLID and a lot of DPs just self-indulging rules conjured out of thin air. A case of an academic trying (and succeeding) to impose his hugely impractical views on the real world. Shit that looks good on paper but is actually offering little value and a lot of times is akin to splitting hair.<p>Anyway. Bye and thanks for the fish.<p>I think I deserve much more than munching on canned BS by this world&#x27;s uncles and their minions.",
