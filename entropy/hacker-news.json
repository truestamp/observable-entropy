      "text": "So, I am currently looking for a tool that allows me to do literate programming.<p>My goal is to create a pen and paper RPG, kinda like D&amp;D, but simpler. I&#x27;d like to develop a Python module along with it which allows me to test and balance the mechanics of the game -- maybe even use it during play sessions to keep track of data. I want to try the literate programming approach here, writing down the rules of the game along with creating the module.<p>While I&#x27;ll be using Python as programming language, I&#x27;d rather avoid anything notebook related. I just don&#x27;t like the concept of notebooks and would rather create a typical module, that can also be viewed&#x2F;rendered as HTML. Would be great if the tool is language agnostic though.<p>Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText are okay. I know org-mode is a common recommendation, but I am not an Emacs guy and org-mode support isn&#x27;t that great in other editors.<p>Typesetting equations using LaTeX syntax is a bonus, but certainly not required. LaTeX as output format is not required at all.",

I know I can hire an attorney, but I was wondering if there are any resources around common contracts to use as a starting point?<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been trying to understand how various common objects, say, a light switch or a suitcase, are manufactured if we thought about the entire process starting from raw materials. Where do all necessary materials come from for the final assembly? How are those materials manufactured? If we follow down the line, how many dependencies does manufacturing a light switch have and what are they? I recently realized that all these steps are very much invisible to consumers and I&#x27;d love to learn more. Any recommendations where to look?",
