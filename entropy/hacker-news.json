This conference paper is the first one focusing on data sharding in the database industry.<p>ICDE is a top-level academic conference on databases and data mining, as well as the flagship conference of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the world’s largest technical professional organization for the advancement of technology. ICDE, ACM SIGMOD Conference and International Conference on Very Large Data Bases are known as the top three data management and database conferences in the world.<p>This paper&#x27;s publication represents the culmination of 5-year of R&amp;D and implementation testing for Apache ShardingSphere guided by its Database Plus development concept. The acceptance of this paper stands as a testament of the acknowledgment of Database Plus, Apache ShardingSphere’s enhanced computing engine and plugin-oriented architecture by the academic community.<p>Thanks to the acceptance of this paper, our community is proud to announce that our efforts have led to innovative breakthroughs in core database technologies.<p>In this paper, the co-authors propose that: considering that today relational databases that are not scalable and efficient enough to solve high concurrency problems still dominate online transaction processing and that NewSQL databases could lead to additional training costs, the database middleware Apache ShardingSphere becomes a very friendly and efficient way to connect and manage multiple databases.<p>Why Did We Choose to Improve the Database Ecosystem Rather Than Creating a New Database?<p>The aim of Apache ShardingSphere is to better utilize the computing and storage capabilities of relational databases in distributed scenarios, rather than implementing a new type of relational database.<p>So far, as relational databases are still the best choice for complete transactions, they are often used to handle online transaction processing.

      "text": "I wanted to try out Unity so I created a small game with it. The reason I post it here is because it is based on an old DOS game that I barely remember but I liked very much. I don&#x27;t remember the name of the original game but would love to play it again some time. So maybe someone of the HN crowd knows the game and can tell me the name :)<p>The game might amuse you for 5 minutes or half an hour. After some levels, you get the gist of how you can move and it&#x27;s not really possible to create a super hard level. It could be extended with different movements to make it more complex, but I&#x27;m not planning to do so for now.",
