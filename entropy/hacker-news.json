      "text": "Content herein is fully copyrighted by approved for public release by Colin Roache.<p>Betterbrands&#x27; Defence has been testing military defense tactics in the field, and while quite effective, has been much more of an ordeal than anticipated given the girth of the catch.\n In an effort to trap some local hackers, a global mob of downy retards was discovered to have attempted a vast array of failed conspiracies.\n The summary of the situation is the remaining monarchies, oligarchies, socialist regimes and communist regimes have inbred within their intellectually-limited upper-class which screwed up their genetics such that they no longer even have the basic set of human DNA. Meanwhile, they shared their genetic defects with lower classes, thereby causing at least a dozen or more seriously gross genetic disorders to be distributed across their entire populations. These genetics defects passed throughout many mobs over the course of centuries, and culminated in a global grouping of the genetic retards. These retard mobs attempted many routes of conspiracy with no avail.\n These retards look so inbred that we are limiting our disclosure of information regarding the removed retards. Some of their body forms looked conical. To be succinct as to the disgustingness, we are releasing the following information: &#x27;bros&#x27; is short for &#x27;brokens&#x27; and refers to a group devirginization process related to joining their mob.\n Betterbrands&#x27; Defence is only releasing the above information regarding the molemob. Betterbrands&#x27; Public Relations will not correspond with the public regarding this press release. Government officials should contact their United Nations representative for further specifics.",
