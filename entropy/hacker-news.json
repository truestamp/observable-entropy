      "text": "Looking at my Discord client, there are about 10 to 20 servers I have join. Some of them are related to work, some dedicated to open-source projects, some are just Twitch streamer communities — you get the idea. There are active discussions in most of them going on, almost 24&#x2F;7.<p>My question is: how do people keep up?<p>I do have notifications disabled as I don&#x27;t like to be interrupted while working. Is it normal to just go through all channels of interest, scanning for important information every once in a while, or is there a trick to it?<p>So far I have been doing a very bad job at keeping in touch with these communities. I feel like I lack the time and energy required.<p>Of course, this also applies to Slack, Teams, and IRC, but is not limited to services that target synchronous communication. Keeping up with mailing lists and bulletin boards has been equally problematic for me.",

Just wanted to tell you about a project i made in the last few days (written in Go). its called barley. It is just a fun little &quot;used languages statistics&quot; bar. (kinda like the github repo language stats)\n If you liked the idea you can:<p>visit the github repo (and maybe star it): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;baris-inandi&#x2F;barley<p>...or download the binaries: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;baris-inandi&#x2F;barley&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest<p>Barley is currently only available on the AUR (with package name ‘barley’). Install it with ‘yay -S barley’",
