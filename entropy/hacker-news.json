      "text": "Seeing Cunningham&#x27;s Law on the front page, I&#x27;m curious: What are some of your past views that you now disagree with?<p>These could be personal, technological, or otherwise. I&#x27;ll start:<p>When news of COVID-19 first broke from China in early 2020, I recall downplaying the severity of the virus to a friend. I wiseacrely remarked that the media erroneously referred to it as the COVID-19 virus, not SARS-CoV-2. Even after he shared his Chinese family members&#x27; experiences with the illness, I wasn&#x27;t convinced.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until it came to America that I paid closer attention. Reading the reports of the toll it took on our healthcare system, I took it more seriously as quickly as the virus was spreading. Regardless of the debate over death attribution and symptomatic severity, I never anticipated the pandemic to be in the top 10 deadliest epidemics by death count.<p>I think exceptionalism and ignorance played important roles in my initial take: &quot;It&#x27;s just like ebola, SARS, or H1N1. If it comes to the US, our superior infrastructure will render the virus a mere nuisance!&quot;<p>P.S. Here&#x27;s an incorrect technological prediction from a friend who had studied aerospace and ocean engineering: &quot;SpaceX could never land a rocket on a moving ocean platform!&quot;",
