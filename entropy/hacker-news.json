      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a software engineer in a midsized Canadian company for the past 2.5 years. I mainly do application level CRUD work. This work is pretty easy and we&#x27;re mostly solving business problems, and never really get involved with technically challenging work. I always wanted to work on harder problems that deal with things lower in the stack. However, I&#x27;m not sure the process to go about this. My undergraduate degree isn&#x27;t in CS, nor did I do any research in undergrad. Past few years I&#x27;ve been rigorously teaching myself CS fundamentals. I&#x27;ve read multiple books about databases and distributed systems. I&#x27;ve played around with these technologies in small side projects. But I have no idea how to pursue a career exploring these concepts in a lower level. Any advice for someone like me?",
