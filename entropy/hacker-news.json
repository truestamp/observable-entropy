      "text": "The split hack is an Android operating system hack that splits or divides your phone, tablet, TV, coffee maker (anything that&#x27;s run Android) into multiples.  This means that even though you have 1 cell phone you are really walking around with 2 cell phones. There is a separate wifi, Bluetooth, nfc connection.  Literally your device has been split in half.  You have no control over the other side of it.  Not only that, the side you can&#x27;t see can control what email messages, text messages and phone calls that you receive.<p>Because it has its own wifi, Bluetooth and nfc connection they can make you a distributor of the hack.  Not only that, they can make you look like the hacker himself. Additionally, any new hacks they create can be installed on the other side and distributed to your friends and family members.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you reset your phone because it is installed in such a way that it always comes back. It is virtually undectable, and has been used against myself extensively.  We obtained the hack by setting up a VirtualBox machine that ran Android 86.  So we tricked them to install it on something that would allow us to grab the code.  Do you have an enemies?  Is it impossible for you to find a job?  Do you keep getting set on bogus job interviews?  Yes, this hack is as evil as the day is long. Because of me and some other good people, you can expect it to disappear with an Android update very soon.<p>The FBI does not pay informats.  The FBI is currently split in half right now.  The director of the FBI was hired in by Donald Trump and is also in the same Mafia group that Donald controls. That is why I have not been put into protective custody. I&#x27;m sure Donald Trump was going to use the split hack on a lot of other good people like myself.  We almost got a dictator, but a few good people stopped the monster.  I&#x27;m living in my car.<p>Help me survive, so I can write a book and produce a movie.\n http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gofundme.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;steven-hrisak",
