      "text": "I don’t have a lot of experience in Node development. From a glance, my idea of a bundler is a utility that takes code from software packages and assembles it with autogenerated boilerplates to produce front end applications that can run without any backend dependence.<p>From looking at a few, my concern is they are inherently bloated and fill a gap that really shouldn’t exist.<p>Shouldn’t JS client code be assembled with packages as a standard, something that compiles together without all this filler nonsense?<p>These things typically produce tens of thousands of lines just to add simple libraries.",
