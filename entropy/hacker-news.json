      "text": "During the last year, I have intensively researched the topic of greenwashing and the possibilities of making ecological sustainability verifiable with the help of Open Science. My goal is to start a company in this field.<p>Unfortunately, during my research I did not find a single company that publishes its ESG &#x2F; sustainability reports on the basis of Open Science, so that the data, models and software used can be reproduced transparently.<p>Why do companies not dare to be transparent with their calculations in this area? Why has not a single company gone this way, although Open Science is very widespread in areas such as Climate Science today?<p>I see massive potential for sustainable companies to differentiate themselves from greenwashing competitors.",
