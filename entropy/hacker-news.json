Privacy for your devices.<p>2. De-Googled Operating Systems usually are open-source and can be actively checked for bugs and vulnerabilities.<p>3. De-Googled OS’ is based on stock Android.<p>4.

Using Google on your device stores your location every time you turn it on. It stores your search history across all your devices in a separate database, meaning even if you were to delete said history on all your devices, Google would still have a record of it.<p>That’s the same for anything you’ve watched on YouTube, every app and extension you’ve used. How often you’ve used them. Where you were and who you interacted with. We would like you to understand that we want to give you back the power of protecting and controlling your data. Detaching from Google would be challenging, but to protect your data privacy, you have to be careful in using the internet and the apps that you use.",
