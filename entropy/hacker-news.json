      "text": "I hear both terms used in either direction. It can be somewhat confusing!<p>The HTTP spec indicates the requests are &quot;downstream&quot; and dependencies are &quot;upstream&quot; [1]<p>nginx indicates the opposite [2], even naming modules based on &quot;upstream&quot; being the direction of dependencies.<p>It may seem trivial, but I get a twinge in the back of my neck every time I hear one over the other; I believe others may have a similar experience. Perhaps the considerable knowledge and experience of the HN community can help clear this up?<p>Simple example:<p><pre><code>  Client -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Load Balancer -&gt; Gateway -&gt; Application Server -&gt; Database\n            &lt;-       &lt;-               &lt;-         &lt;-                    &lt;-\n</code></pre>\nOn the one hand, it just seems natural that &quot;upstream&quot; refers to the inbound request being sent from one system to another. It takes effort (connection pooling, throttling, retries, etc.) to make a request to an (upstream) dependency, just as it takes effort to swim upstream. The response is (usually) easy... just return it... hence, &quot;downstream&quot;. Recall the usual meaning of &quot;upload&quot; and &quot;download&quot;. Upstream seems to make sense when talking about processing&#x2F;effort.<p>But conversely, an individual client request is like a drop of water, that feeds into a trickle (proxy), that moves through the larger load balancer, etc. Certainly, the application server&#x27;s database is most likely much larger than the client. So, the size of the stream (usually) gets larger the deeper into the stack a request goes. Downstream seems to make sense when talking about data size&#x2F;volume.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc7230#section-2.3<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;http&#x2F;ngx_http_upstream_module.html",
