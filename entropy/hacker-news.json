      "text": "Hey HN,<p>again some progress on my little (maybe useless) toy project called tone[1] hoping for feedback.<p>tone is a cross plattform command line audio tagger deployed as a single static binary without dependencies, so a wget should be enough to install on any platform (seems not to work on M1 Macs atm... if someone can help here I would really appreciate it).<p>Improvements since the last post (v0.0.4):<p><pre><code>  - multiarch docker image for all major platforms\n    - docker pull sandreas&#x2F;tone:v0.0.7\n    - docker run -it --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v &quot;$(pwd)&quot;:&#x2F;mnt sandreas&#x2F;tone:v0.0.7 dump my-audio-book.m4b\n  - new JSON metadata format with JSONPath support \n    - tone dump my-file.m4b --format=json --query=&quot;$.meta.album&quot;\n  - metadata writer fixes for m4b audiobooks iTunes\n \n</code></pre>\nGeneral Features:<p><pre><code>  - Supports most common formats (mp3, m4a, flac, ape, etc.)\n  - Most common AND custom metadata fields\n  - Chapter support\n  - Embeddable pictures\n  - Hackable (write your own taggers with scripting language)\n</code></pre>\nThanks and have fun.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sandreas&#x2F;tone",
