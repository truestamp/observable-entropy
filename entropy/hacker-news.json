The solutions I found include Unix Sockets with gRPC (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;aspnet&#x2F;core&#x2F;grpc&#x2F;interprocess?view=aspnetcore-6.0), local HTTP Servers with a REST API or gRPC, even \nJSON over stdin&#x2F;stdout (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xi-editor&#x2F;xi-editor).\nSolutions for datastorage include custom file formats, sqlite databases or bundled mongodb instances into the main application.<p>I figured out the backend part with analysis running multithreaded and writing into a sqlite database.\nFor the IPC I spawn a gRPC Server which clients connect to over HTTP&#x2F;2.\nThat way I compile a platform agnostic backend and platform specific frontends.\nIt all works okish but I feel like it&#x27;s unnecessarily complicated and there could be a common strategy I am missing.<p>*TL;DR: What are modern architectures for desktop applications equivalent to a microservice architecture with backend&#x2F;frontend separation, message queueing, pub&#x2F;sub, authentication, ...?*",
