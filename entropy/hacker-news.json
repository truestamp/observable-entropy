      "text": "Inspired by Facebook&#x27;s whistleblower confession about how Facebook (among some other apps) cares more about negative content and doesn&#x27;t care about privacy, I decided to create an open-source chat app.<p>This chat app doesn&#x27;t save any history or messages in the database. Chat history is active as long as you are in the conversation screen, once you go back or close it, messages are not there. Some kind of &quot;live chat&quot;.<p>I made it open-source because I want people to be able to see how their data is being used and to see the truth behind the scene. By not open-sourcing the code it would by only my word &quot;I&#x27;m not saving history&quot;, in this way it&#x27;s tangible.<p>I published the backend part on GitHub, the app is coming soon. You can follow me on Twitter (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;PozitivnaMirta) for more updates on my progress. Also you&#x27;ll find there Github repos.",

I read some chapters of practical common lisp but it feels a little outdated. Is it still good book to learn lisp? Is there other book recommendation? Is Common lisp a good choice for modern time or is another Lisp recommended now a days? Thanks in advance.",
