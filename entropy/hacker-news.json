      "text": "Hello everyone, I wanted to ask you how do you learn to build complex web apps by just using javascript? It seems to be a common thing to complain in HN about bloated websites with a heavy use of js and frameworks, for example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29703546.<p>Every time I try to build anything more complex than a weather app, my codebase becomes a mess. I&#x27;m still very new to software development and I still have a lot to learn, so maybe that&#x27;s part of the problem. How do you manage your app state, how do you get back your state after a crash or a refresh? All these seem difficult to accomplish without a framework.<p>Any good courses, blogs, repos to study in order to learn this? Thank you!",
