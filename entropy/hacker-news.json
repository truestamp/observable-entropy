I have been an early adopter of Dashlane, among the 10,000 first users and never regretted my choice. Until today. I feel betrayed.<p>I guess that was mentioned somewhere in the legalese that nobody reads.<p>Time to move to KPassX I guess.<p>Note: yes, I know that from a security point of view, using Daslane means trust them with your passwords - since I can&#x27;t tell if they really don&#x27;t keep a non-encrypted version of my data.",
