      "text": "Hi,<p>I am looking to team up with other indie hackers to build some cool projects. I am currently creating a community of tech professionals who can support each other in creating self-standing projects and investing in each other. I have built an MVP that allows for easy collaboration where value added to a project rewards with stake. This stake pays out to all stakeholders when the project makes money. This means no more equity discussions. You get proportionately to what you contribute.<p>The value I can provide coding services for your project, and am currently learning sales.<p>The projects currently under the collaboration tool are making 1 - 2k&#x2F;mo. (starting 1 month ago)<p>If you are interested send me a DM or post a comment!",

      "text": "Since we&#x27;re working from home more often than ever these days, many of us have started to take our day-to-day workflow&#x2F;experience more seriously, and have improved our personal workspaces as a result.<p>What are some of your favorite hacks for improving your day-to-day ease and comfort?<p>For example, in my case, I finally invested in a real DESK, with drawers and everything, as opposed to just having a simple manufactured rectangle table from Walmart. And to improve storage so everything&#x27;s within arm&#x27;s reach most of the time, I bought some adhesive-mounted hooks from the office supply store and mounted them on the inside facing plane, under the desk where my knees and feet are. Now I can keep my BT headphones on a hook, my scissors are there, and a hat for when I don&#x27;t feel like combing my hair but need to be on a webcam :)<p>I fully admit that&#x27;s underwhelming at best, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking. I&#x27;m just looking for ideas to improve my workspace beyond the obvious like &quot;buy a nice chair&quot;, &quot;new monitor&quot;, &quot;input switch&quot;, etc. That stuff&#x27;s all well and good but having already done that, I&#x27;m curious to see what others have come up with. Things that didn&#x27;t even occur to me, that I didn&#x27;t know <i>could</i> be improved, that sorta stuff.<p>So, what are your favorite hacks for your personal workspace? What&#x27;s made your day-to-day more enjoyable?",
