      "text": "Apparently it is possible, that is what ETF-Cripto is trying to do. They have just released their MVP. \nYou can see on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;etfcripto.com&#x2F;investment&#x2F;<p>But what is ETF-Cripto? The project is created so that cryptocurrency investors worldwide can invest in an intelligent token and AI-CRIPTO contracts that group the 10 best cryptocurrencies in the current market. Thanks to artificial intelligence, it is possible to anticipate the fall and rise in the value of cryptocurrencies, reducing the investor&#x27;s risk index. A platform has been generated so that the investor can invest either in the token or in AI-CRIPTO contracts, the difference is that the token has the functionality to be bought, sold, transferred in a wallet; while the AI-CRIPTO contract is a financial leverage contract so that the stock exchange can buy, sell or be transferred in the NYC stock market.<p>What do you think about the idea?",
