      "text": "I believe I created the first and only place to earn crypto while job searching.<p>jobcull.com<p>I would like your insight regarding this marketing tactic and if it&#x27;s a good or bad idea. I am using my own money to payout. Currently capped at $100 a month and divide it out among the users on my platform who chooses to participate. As I payout, they will find it&#x27;s legit and tell others. No one can game the system as it takes way more effort than what the payout is worth, few dollars a month. I figured this would be a better use of my money than advertising into the void. The main purpose of my site is to find a job, job management, get paid each month for doing so.",
