      "text": "As the title says, my psychiatrist has been discussing with me the potential diagnosis of an ADHD (Inattentive type). My symptoms are disorganization, poor memory, frequent switching between topics, inability to start something complex aka proceed in a planned way and etc. Especially, I have been procrastinating so much at work because of one thing or the other and I don&#x27;t really feel that clarity that I think I should have. I suppose whether or not there&#x27;ll be a diagnosis is a different matter (we&#x27;re also looking into sleep apnea). Meanwhile, I just wanted to get insights into how people who later got a genuine diagnosis coped before actually getting on medication and maybe get some validation. (As in it&#x27;s not just me who&#x27;s slacking off because of a potential medical problem and other people did it too I guess, or maybe I&#x27;m misguided in thinking such).",
