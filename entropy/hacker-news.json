      "text": "Hi,\nI am from Pakistan and I recently finished interviewing with a German company. The company was supposed to provide visa sponsorship and relocation package if they offer the role. My friend referred me to the company, the interviews went well and I was very hopeful that I would get the offer.<p>But today I received an email from their HR stating that they can&#x27;t proceed with the process because the waiting time for visa processing is very long (a year to be exact). I was surprised by it and replied with an embassy link stating that it would take around 6-12 weeks to process a work visa. They haven&#x27;t replied yet. I am not sure from where they got their information.<p>Can someone who had recently received visa sponsorship from Germany tell me is this the case or they are making stuff up just because they don&#x27;t want to offer me the role?<p>Should I keep on applying to German companies give the fact that covid has affected visa processing and relocation?",
