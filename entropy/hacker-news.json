      "text": "Hi HN. Do you have any advice for applying to Junior Software Engineering roles? How to get through the automated resume screening, does having projects on GitHub help, etc?<p>I hear the job market is &quot;hot,&quot; but is that true of entry positions too?<p>I&#x27;m a self-taught programmer who recently decided to finish my bachelor&#x27;s degree in Computer Science. I&#x27;ll be finishing in a month or so, and I&#x27;m trying to do some planning in advance.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m asking is: If you were fresh out of college, how would *you* go about getting a job?<p>If anyone is curious about the weird graduation time, I go to wgu.edu, and they let you accelerate through the classes as fast as you can go. I recommend it.",
