      "text": "Hey, HN! When building user interfaces for smaller and mobile apps you&#x27;ve got quite a few tools to choose from. Figma and the like work great for them. But for the complex projects we do at our UX agency, those tools are a pain to use. Designing a control interface for an industrial machine in Figma doesn&#x27;t make any fun. You often need to somehow hack the interactions you need into it.<p>To make prototyping complex interfaces easier, we built Antetype.\nWith layouts that really adapt to changing content and (hopefully) easy-to-understand interaction options. For us, it really helps creating complex and working UIs – to test and validate ideas.<p>Antetype is also build on web concepts: \nThat means you can use any HTML&#x2F;CSS tricks you know and also any JS framework you require. We often use that to embed interactive 3D models or working charts (instead of static images).<p>Video of Antetype&#x27;s features + prototypes built with it: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SUBpJlLJrdY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SUBpJlLJrdY</a><p>Website with examples + demo videos:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.antetype.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.antetype.com</a><p>Register to download it (macOS only):\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.antetype.com&#x2F;register&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.antetype.com&#x2F;register&#x2F;</a><p>(You can use it entirely free. No water marks or restrictions. Our paid plan just takes care of hosting if you don&#x27;t want to do it yourself.)<p>I would love to hear your thoughts – we released it to the public just a few weeks ago.",
