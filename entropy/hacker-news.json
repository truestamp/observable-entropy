      "text": "I live in southern utah near Zions national park a huge tourist destination. I&#x27;m a burned out developer wanting to get into glamping but I&#x27;m lacking the financial resources.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing some market analysis and there&#x27;s many people around running glamping businesses averaging around 100-130 per night according to Airbnb.<p>So if you have 5 units on one property there&#x27;s decent potential as that could gross 3k per unit per month or roughly 15k per month.<p>I&#x27;m looking for someone who&#x27;d take 70&#x2F;30 until paid back and 30&#x2F;70 after including 30 percent equity upon sale of the property.<p>I freelance and that&#x27;s been a little difficult to use in the past for a normal bank loan.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about crowdfunding which could work because I&#x27;d be able to offer a night or longer stay..<p>Eventually I&#x27;d also like to create a mobile glamping retreat business eventually for corporate retreats, festivals, weddings, etc... But I want to get my feet wet first with designing a great experience in a single location.",
