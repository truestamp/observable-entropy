      "text": "My company uses Slack. The amount of noise in channels is extreme due to the low friction that Slack allows for one word channel responses, or people posting just an emoji or gif.<p>It seems like a huge amount of noise could be eliminated if Slack (or other work chat apps) required a minimum amount of characters for a channel post.<p>Does anyone know of a work chat app that allows for this requirement?<p>(For 1:1 chat, I can see not having this restriction. But having say, 100 character minimum post requirement for all channel posts seems like it would force really good chat edict - as well help reduce the “Slack stress” we’ve all come to experience)",
