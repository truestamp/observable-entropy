I would like to pivot to a job with more personal meaning to me. Perhaps something that helps people with addiction, or more generally mental health. Or anything that could help deal with the fentanyl crisis. Perhaps even more generally, any job that works on helping the youth. Has anyone done anything in these fields using your programming background? I&#x27;ve started classes to be a counselor, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a very good fit for such a people-centered job.",
