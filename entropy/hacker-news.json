      "text": "Does anyone know a good valuation model based on organic (google search) traffic?<p>I have a side-project website that over the years grew to attract some nice traffic, and a potential buyer contacted me about it, but I don&#x27;t know how to price it. Because it was a side project, I never focused on monetising it, so ARR multiples would not really make any sense as a model (and I doubt that they would be interested in buying it for the ARR). My best guess is it&#x27;s a proxy for one of the competitors, that want traffic, or someone who wants to boost it a bit and sell to the competitors.<p>The site gets about 2.5m clicks per year from google search for keywords that, at least according to semrush, competitors are paying between 1.5 and 3 USD per click, so that traffic must be worth something. It&#x27;s not even actively optimised for SEO (before anyone starts blaming me, it&#x27;s a side-project), so someone with SEO skills could probably boost that significantly over a short period and then sell on.<p>If you were buying or selling something like this, how would you price it?",
