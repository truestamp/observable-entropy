The first round was a database coding assignment; the second round was a general knowledge interview; the third round was a case study interview; the final round was a presentation on a real-world problem that I had a week to prepare.<p>They got in touch with me again and said that the presentation I gave was good, but they want me to &quot;make my presentation more beautiful&quot;. Is this normal for a junior position? It&#x27;s starting to feel like they are just dangling a carrot in front of me for reasons that I don&#x27;t understand. The only reason I can think of is if I am up against a few other candidates who also delivered good presentations, and it all comes down to who can make things prettier now...",
