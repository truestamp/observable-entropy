      "text": "I have been working as a software engineer for over 5 years. My first few dev jobs involved 100% pair programming. At my current job pairing rarely happens. I&#x27;ve come to realize that my first few years as a developer (spent always pairing) has done very little to prepare me to be successful as a solo developer.<p>To put it simply: I&#x27;m highly incompetent as a solo developer, but people expect me to be somewhat senior because I&#x27;ve been at it for a while. My preference would be not to return to constant pair programming, but it seems like I&#x27;m fated to do so. Has anyone else encountered this? Are there any tricks or resources for learning to stand alone as a developer?",
