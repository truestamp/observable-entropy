      "text": "Hey HN, sharing something I&#x27;ve been working on.<p>I love reading new voices. I subscribe to a lot of brilliant newsletters but found it hard to keep track of all the great stuff I was reading. I&#x27;d read something, love it, never be able to find it again. And then, how do you find new ones worth trying? And which posts do you start with?<p>With Inbox World, you can submit and upvote the best of Substack and other similar platforms. The goal is to build a community around the best independent writing out there. It&#x27;s like HN for newsletters!<p>This is a passion project for me and I&#x27;m not technical at all. This is its earliest v1 form, open to everyone; no logins or data collected, no ads, no premium tiers, everything on one page. And I just added an automated email that sends you the most upvoted links weekly — a newsletter for newsletters.<p>Would love to hear what you think in the comments below. Thanks for reading.<p>PS: If you want to chat about this idea or are interested in working together, I’d love to talk. Ping me here or send me an email at kabir.chibber@gmail.com",
