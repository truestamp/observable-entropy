      "text": "Over the past week I built a project to let people self-host an entire maps stack so they don&#x27;t have to send data to the big G. Right now it includes a base map, geocoder and directions server. Currently only bicycle directions are supported, and I&#x27;m only hosting tiles for Seattle because I&#x27;m unemployed and can&#x27;t afford to host data for the whole planet. Check it out!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.ellenhp.me&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maps.ellenhp.me&#x2F;</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ellenhp&#x2F;headway\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ellenhp&#x2F;headway</a><p>Ultimately I&#x27;d like to really focus on transit routing (not implemented) but I&#x27;ll probably throw a driving mode in there too.",

Maybe books will be more like this in the future?<p>By way of example: I&#x27;d like to see a continually updated book on climate change, that is both an in depth look at where we are and where we think we&#x27;re going (new tech, etc). Wikipedia is something like this, but it&#x27;s not linear, and that format is really helpful for onboarding people to ideas without assuming a lot of background knowledge.",
