Quick Examples: Bubble.io[1], OutSystems[2], Microsoft Power Apps[3] that targets this sort of niche, but there&#x27;s plenty of more. They&#x27;re far from perfect, but they don&#x27;t feel like a fad this time.<p>Most of these low-code&#x2F;no-code platforms are proprietary and often expensive; I want to contribute to alternatives. What FOSS low-code&#x2F;no-code platforms exist, and which have the most potential?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bubble.io\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.outsystems.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;modern-development&#x2F;\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;powerapps.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;",
