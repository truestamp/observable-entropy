      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a little obsessed recently with why PageDraw failed (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16467387). Pagedraw promised to generate react code from sketch or figma designs.<p>It would make my life much easier if they had succeeded. In that world, when my cofounder and I finish polishing our designs in figma, we click a button and (most of) the React UI code is written for us. All we would have to do is wire up the generated components to data sources, and voila. Take the rest of the day off.<p>If it had worked well, it could automate a good amount of the boring UI work I need to do on a consistent basis. Why am I still manually writing styled components when the information is all there in figma already?<p>What do you think, HN?<p>Curious if anyone knows of great solutions for this problem or thinks that something like this should (or shouldn&#x27;t &#x2F; couldn&#x27;t) exist.<p>What do folks think of Anima? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.animaapp.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;design-to-code&#x2F;how-to-export-figma-to-react&#x2F;<p>Or Overlay? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.overlay-tech.com&#x2F;<p>Figma&#x27;s own blog post on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.figma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-figma-to-react&#x2F;<p>A reddit discussion: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;FigmaDesign&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ht9krs&#x2F;best_way_to_convert_designs_from_figma_to_react&#x2F;<p>Is anyone else working on this?",
