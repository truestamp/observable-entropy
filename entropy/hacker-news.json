      "text": "One thing that&#x27;s become clear to me after months of threads and comments both online and in person is that folks have strongly held and divergent opinions on what their ideal office setup would be. From people who would be happy to never step foot in another office to those who miss the in-person interaction and everything in between.<p>But what is the actual answer then? I&#x27;ve seen lots of what people want, but how can you compromise these positions in any way? Or perhaps there&#x27;s nothing that works for every company but instead you&#x27;ll pick a place to work partially based on their office policy?<p>(Disclaimer: I have zero power to make these changes in my office or anyone else&#x27;s I just am curious what people think)",
