      "text": "Building on the &quot;Who is Hiring?&quot; threads, here comes a monthly thread for folks who are in search of a co-founder. Let people know what you are building and what you are looking for in a co-founder. Please state the location and include REMOTE if you are open to building a company remotely. When remote work is not an option, include ONSITE.<p>Please only post if you are the founder (or one of the co-founders) of the startup. No recruiting firms, venture builders, or job boards. Only one post per company (how many co-founders can one look for anyway). Please explain on a high level what your company does.<p>Commenters: please don&#x27;t reply to these posts telling people why their idea won&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s off-topic here.<p>Readers: please only email if you are personally interested in committing yourself to a co-founder role. No &quot;CTO for hire&quot; companies!<p>P.S. This is simply following on from threads posted by &quot;whoisbuilding&quot;, as there hasn&#x27;t been a new one since August.",
