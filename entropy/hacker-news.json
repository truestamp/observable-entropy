      "text": "Long story short, I&#x27;m eligible to join a state funded program on web&#x2F;e-commerce development. It features over a thousand hours of training (and internship), over half of them being about the Magento 2 platform. It wouldn&#x27;t cost me anything but it&#x27;s a major commitment time-wise. It seems an interesting opportunity but I worry about overspecialization. Despite dabbling in programming and being on HN for 8 years, I don&#x27;t come from a technical background so I can&#x27;t fully understand the reliability of the platform and the future payoff of such training. I asked around my trusted dev friends irl, but I&#x27;d like to hear the opinion of HN users as well, especially the ones who had to deal with Magento 2.",
