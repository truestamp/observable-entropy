      "text": "Dear Community,<p>I have a problem with Google handling my GDPR request. Before forwarding this issue to my lawyer and notifying my local data privacy authority, I want to try my luck here.<p>The issue is that it is impossible to delete Google Calendar entries permanently. Even if not visible in the Calendar (and dust bin) anymore, those entries are still visible in Google Takeout with the status &quot;CANCELLED&quot;.<p>How to reproduce:\n1. Create a calendar entry\n2. Delete that calendar entry\n3. Empty the dust bin\n4. Download your Google Calendar entry via Google Takeout\n5. The calendar entry is still visible, so it must be stored on Google servers still.<p>I tried contact the support multiple times and also asked them to escalate this case, which was done. But in the end I always receive a generic answer that I should delete my cookies and cache and try again. If that does not work, I should fill out the Google Takeout feedback form.<p>Has someone else had the same issue? How should I proceed to get my data deleted?",
