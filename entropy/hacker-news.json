I&#x27;ve been developing large apps in my day job but today I&#x27;m looking to develop a simple web app connected to a few data sources like Airtable. I&#x27;m amazed of the complexity of today environments and what you need to learn to have something up and running. I&#x27;ve used MERN, RoR and other things but there&#x27;s so much hidden complexity and that it&#x27;s difficult to use for small projects (just getting to an env that works is a pain). What would you recommend ?",
