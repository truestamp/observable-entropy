      "text": "So let&#x27;s say someone (me) has been iterating a data tool for a few years and wants to make a reasonably nice UI for it, and then open-source the whole thing. And let&#x27;s say person (me) doesn&#x27;t want to deal with React or any other libraries, but does have a bunch of portable UI code from other projects that happens to work fine for drawing UI components to display these big data models.<p>Is it gauche to include your own UI components in data projects these days? I&#x27;m talking about things like dialog boxes and waiters, progress loaders, simple component handlers and things like that. The goal here is to <i>not</i> have dependencies, but to also have a usable client-side app for people without coding skills. Is it frowned upon to just include a custom framework?",
