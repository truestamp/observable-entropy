      "text": "There&#x27;s no question the iPhone changed computing, but as someone who was too young&#x2F;not plugged into tech enough at the time to remember, I&#x27;m curious what the release was like.<p>How far in advance (if at all) were touch smartphones viewed as a revolutionary piece of technology?
