Both my ip and billing address point to Krasnodar, Russia.<p>I immediately tried to contact them about the mistake by email, in live support and on twitter, and got dead silence in response.<p>It is frustrating, but after 7 years I need to find a new cloud provider to host my projects.<p>Which ones would you recommend? Basically need a cheap VPS mainly as a web server and a VPN.",
