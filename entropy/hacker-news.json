      "text": "I love music and I&#x27;m always trying to discover new music that I can enjoy. In the past years I was using a fairly tedious process of organizing the music albums (or DJ sets, radio shows) in a few lists:<p>- Want to Listen<p>- Listened<p>- Listened (and liked)<p>I wanted to keep track of these lists, what I discovered each month&#x2F;year and share all this activity and lists with my friends. For that, I was using a combination of tools that weren&#x27;t made exactly for this job (Discogs+Spotify+IM apps), resulting in a cumbersome experience.<p>So a few months ago I started this hobby project, with the purpose of streamlining my process (make it as easy as possible) and making it fairly simple to share it with fellow music explorers.<p>The basic idea is that you add items to your &quot;Want to Listen&quot; list - these are music albums (or even mixes), that you want to listen. After you listened to them, you can mark them as &quot;Listened&quot; or &quot;Listened and liked&quot;. Your activity is then shared with your friends, and you have a public profile where this activity and your lists appear. You can think of it kinda like &quot;Goodreads but for music&quot;.<p>There are a few ways to add items to your lists (more to be added in the future):<p>- search by artist name or release title<p>- add using a Discogs release URL<p>- add using a Mixcloud URL<p>- add using a Spotify album URL<p>It&#x27;s still in super early version, so there are a lot of missing features and for sure a lot of rough edges. I&#x27;m open to feedback and suggestions!<p>You can find it at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digs.fm. A public profile:<p>Stack: Rail, Postgres (also powers the full-text search capability)<p>External APIs used: Discogs, Spotify, Mixcloud<p>Data provided partly by: Musicbrainz (~2.6M releases indexed currently)<p>Hosted on: Render.com (but I&#x27;ll probably move it to a VPS)",
