      "text": "For the last two years I have been a DevOps and AWS cloud architect at a FinTech startup in Europe.<p>I have just been offered to take on a project which would consist on transferring ~300M EUR worth of customers from a partner to our company as a Project Manager.<p>Previously to being a DevOps, I was a Cybersecurity consultant for a Big4 company for two years.<p>As I am still 27 years old and I have always having dreamt of joining a FAANG company and&#x2F;or starting my very own startup, I am unsure whether this opportunity (which looks like being a project coordinator) would be positive to my CV in the tech world especially in non-european countries such as the USA. Although I have the feeling that I&#x27;d love the job, I am afraid this would be the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; for a short tech career.<p>How did you guys face this kind of situation? What would you do?<p>Thanks for your feedback",

      "text": "Hi HN.<p>I built Payload to make file transfers easy for less-technical users who need large&#x2F;fast transfers, so I have focused on auto-discovery, drag-and-drop, visually distinct device icons.<p>It&#x27;s using Tauri (an &quot;Electron alternative&quot; built on Rust) which keeps my binaries small and bundles to .msi, .dmg, .deb and .appimage. No CLI, iOS or Android support (yet).<p>The network stack is a separate binary written in Go. It uses mDNS for local network discovery and TLS over TCP or Quic, with a public Ed25519 keypair for each device. The protocol is ad-hoc and symmetrical control stream using JSON and binary data streams. Planning to open source these parts eventually..<p>Transfers should saturate the local network link. It reaches ~116 MB&#x2F;s wired at my home, but if you have a &gt;1000 Mbit link, I&#x27;d be curious to see how much speed you can squeeze out.<p>See also:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21575869\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21575869</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24351111\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24351111</a>",
