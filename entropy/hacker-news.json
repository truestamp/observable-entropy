      "text": "It seems like the state of hiring is getting even more ridiculous, and I&#x27;ve struggled to find anything for over a year. In particular, almost every frontend job runs some homework or hackerrank thing based on React, regardless of whether it&#x27;s specified as the most important requirement. I don&#x27;t tend to win these competitions, and I don&#x27;t tend to use React, and it&#x27;s an unsustainable way to live. I didn&#x27;t jump on the bandwagon meanwhile about everyone else in the world did. I could probably refine my knowledge of it a bit, but most &#x27;React devs&#x27; have been grinding it out professionally for years. Is it even worth trying to conpete in a massive market like this where the skill is so commonplace? Is there another area I could focus my energy like Vue where maybe there isn&#x27;t as many people out there? I can only do so many 3-8 hour react based tests that I ultimately miss a test case on or simply don&#x27;t compare favourably to the 1000 other people who applied.<p>More broadly, I&#x27;m a programmer, I&#x27;ve been doing it for years, and can&#x27;t make money doing it, so I&#x27;m in a manual labour job that ends soon and pays like shit. I know JS quite well, learn quickly, and establish good rapport with colleagues, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be effective. Wtf do I do to actually put an ostensibly useful skill to actual use?",
