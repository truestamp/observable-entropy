      "text": "Hi there,<p>I&#x27;ve build a bunch of smaller projects trying to give people alternatives to social media (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;potato.horse) and noticed that a lot of people actually decided to subscribe to the content through email. The problem is that I didn&#x27;t expect any significant traffic, so ended up sending emails personally (I&#x27;m THAT lean).<p>Although this is great from marketing perspective (people like speaking with real people, who would&#x27;ve guessed), this scales very poorly.<p>I&#x27;ve used Mailchim&#x2F;Mailgun in the past, but I was wondering if anything changed in the past few years in that domain.<p>Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s important to me (in order of priority):<p>- a good API client, well documented API (I want to spend max 1 day of setting it up and plugging into 2-3 projects)\n- custom domain support\n- no privacy-dubious practices (ideally, I&#x27;d just call the API with a list of messages and store the contact list on my side)\n- good record with spam blockers (I&#x27;m aware that this depends mainly on my domain)\n- ideally less than 10$ per month for ca 2000 emails<p>What I _don&#x27;t_ care about:<p>- any marketing related features, I just want to automate email delivery<p>Most of my sites are on Vercel or Cloudfront, but  I&#x27;d rather avoid spending too much time with AWS and go for something really simple. I don&#x27;t want to spend too much time on infra.<p>I&#x27;m happy with any &quot;mainstream&quot; language, but I&#x27;d rather use node + Typescript since I use it on a daily basis at the moment.<p>Got any tips? Should I use a SaaS platform for that? Or should I just set up a DO Droplet with a service and use that instead?",
