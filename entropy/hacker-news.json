      "text": "I received an email from Google Fi this week. Google claims that I have used too much international data roaming (I typically use around 1gb per month) and have not used the service in the US enough, according to the latest terms &amp; conditions update. I have read through the latest terms &amp; conditions, the acceptable use policy, etc. - and there is nothing specifically stated about this. So, if you are also a Google Fi subscriber and not in the US 100% of the time - be aware, and you may want to consider seeking alternatives soon.<p>Given how Google tends to kill products&#x2F;services on a whim, I guess I should have expected something like this at some point. For some reason, as a 5+ year paying customer, owner of multiple generations of Google(Pixel) phones, etc., I didn&#x27;t expect to be blocked with only a 30 day notice. The lack of transparency, proactive communication, and overall terrible customer experience is making me think hard about subscribing to anything from Google again after this.",
