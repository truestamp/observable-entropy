      "text": "** First off, I&#x27;m aware this topic has a strong political side to it and being aware at that risk it is NOT my intention to turn this into a turf war. I acknowledge propaganda isn&#x27;t one sided. This post is about US companies, not about the geopolitical situation. Please stay civil in the comments. **<p>I opened Twitter today and I was just shocked.<p>In my western EU democracy, I woke up to the trends in all of social media looking like the discourse is completely dominated by an actor that represents the absolute opposite of any respected media source or any of my peers.<p>Investigating those posts and accounts, all of which try to sow doubt in the media and general disinformation, just all of it is fishy. The people aren&#x27;t real. The network is shallow and unconnected. There are strange typos. The accounts posted meaningless fluff before and &quot;woke up&quot; to spew out carefully crafted psychological warfare.<p>It just seems so completely obvious to me that this is a carefully orchestrated attack on public discourse and I feel weird that just nobody seems to speak up about this.<p>And it is Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and others fueling this with the social proof of their brands by letting this happen.<p>I&#x27;m all for free speech by real people, but after all we&#x27;ve learned over the past years, how come that in 2022 social networks silently stay behind this with their brand? Where are the employees speaking up? Where are the executives hiding?<p>I am just so shocked and I didn&#x27;t know where else to bring my frustration.",
