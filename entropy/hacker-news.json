I&#x27;ve never accepted a managing position though have been asked.<p>Looking back on my career, I noticed that I tend to leave or avoid startups that have created a management layer between executive leadership and ICs.<p>I understand management is necessary (at a Peter Drucker-level understanding) for a growing business.<p>However from practical experience, it seems to me that when you start hiring managers is when you start introducing overhead, cruft, and the dead weight of bureaucracy to your organization.<p>As an eng, I can happily move from company to company lending my strengths as an IC in early stages, and jump ship when things get too formal.<p>But is there an argument for founders to consider that managers ultimately do more harm than good? The first counter that comes to mind is that you simply cannot scale without management. However, I&#x27;m curious to hear others thoughts on this and if they&#x27;ve witnessed alternative approaches that show promise.",
