In conversations with strangers I become anxious and the exchange of words invariably fizzles out. I struggle to cross the divide between being being an acquaintance and being a friend. I’d like to get over my shyness and become a more friendly person. How have you all gotten over inherent shyness? What approaches to making and keeping friends have you all found work? How does one become a people person?<p>Thank you for your advice!",
