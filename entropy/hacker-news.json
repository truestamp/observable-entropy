      "text": "Hi, I need to be able to quickly create software architecture diagrams for our customers. I have previously been using presentation software (e.g. Google Slides) and graphics editors (e.g. Affinity Designer). And while they allow me to create quite beautiful diagrams, they are not very fast if you have to e.g. add additional elements which don&#x27;t fit the existing layout.<p>For smaller architectures https:&#x2F;&#x2F;diagrams.mingrammer.com works really well, but it often breaks for more complex layouts.<p>What are your recommendations?",
