      "text": "Hi HN!<p>I&#x27;m a developer who noticed that I haven&#x27;t done much experimentation lately. I decided I wanted to change that this year.<p>This month I built a simple resume builder with the main goal of practicing front-end development, and to scratch an itch I had when updating my resume. :)<p>After it was functional enough, I casually shared with some friends to express my enjoyment of crafting something just for the sake of having some fun. To my surprise they ended up asking how they could send to others. So I went one step further, due to my pure excitement, and hosted it on Netlify to make publicly available.<p>In case you&#x27;re curious, I used the React component library Mantine[1] in this project. I loved it, so I definitely recommend to check it out for your next React project.<p>Have thoughts to share? I would love to know! :)<p>If you&#x27;re postponing starting that project you have been thinking of, just do it. Right now. Just create a new dir, load up your framework of choice and start it, even a couple of lines are enough to get you started. We should never forget that to play around is awesome.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mantine.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mantine.dev</a>",
