My spouse is very supportive but we both need some kind of professional help to avoid burnout. Any advice&#x2F;help would be totally appreciated. Thanks hackers.",

      "text": "I have a job board I am building with some people, and to begin gaining traction we bulk uploaded current employers we work with for them to later verify their profiles (about 50,000 so far). We have tried some simple GPT-3 description generation, for the company descriptions, with a few variations but with 50,000+ employers we are getting penalized with low content pages and soft 404s on certain profiles.<p>I am looking for strategies or work-arounds to do bulk profile&#x2F;url uploads and avoid being penalized for low content, duplicate content, soft 404s, etc.<p>It may be helpful to add that these employers are in the same industry, and their differences are names, websites, and phone numbers. We have looked at beefing up internal linking but are open to any suggestions.<p>Thank you - notgeorge",
