While there are a few services that enable interviewees to schedule a mock interview to help prepare for their interview but almost none of these services seem to enable interviewee to select a particular interviewer based on their experience, expertise and background.<p>Professionals working in the field can signup to become an interviewer and set their own price as well.<p>Would this kinda service be useful to you as an interviewee or interviewer?",
