      "text": "How can i reach Gmail and other megacorps to let them know an account was probably compromised? These people don&#x27;t even have a contact form...<p>Long story: So i was hanging out on this perfectly legit forum when a sketchy person started to ask if we could provide them 1TB storage that they could pay for but would rather go with a friendly transaction rather than through a business. Sounds nice so far, maybe a fellow FLOSS hacker has too much stuff to backup?<p>They claimed it was 1TB of <i>logs</i> which raised our suspicions but they said it was all legit and we could look through it they wouldn&#x27;t mind. So we got a 2MB sample zip but inside were stolen credentials from a third person, as well as - you guessed it - malware named &quot;Passwords.txt.lnk&quot;. It looks like the credentials were compiled by a malware called Redline.<p>So now i have tons of passwords for this poor 3rd party but no way to contact them to let them know they&#x27;ve been pwned. Any ideas? I thought about contacting gmail &amp; others so they can probably SMS this person, but for most of those accounts i could not find contact info for the sysadmins or security team.<p>Going to the police is probably not gonna help and might get me and other friendly people in trouble for accessing this data in the first place so i&#x27;m not going for that. To be clear, i haven&#x27;t tested any of these credentials but i&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re real since the usernames&#x2F;passwords have some resemblance yet subtle variations.<p>What would you do?",
