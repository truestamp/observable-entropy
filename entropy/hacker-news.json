      "text": "Forgive any potential misuse of terminology (not my primary field of expertise), &quot;fully Kubernetes-native stack&quot; here is meant to mean that all services and infrastructure (or as much as possible) are deployed within the cluster itself.<p>For example, rather than using any AWS&#x2F;Google managed databases, queues, or caches, deploying open-source varieties using standard Kubernetes objects instead.<p>If so, does anyone have any useful guides&#x2F;manifests&#x2F;charts or advice for setting up and configuring something similar? I have a bunch of old devices I&#x27;ve been steadily repurposing as compute&#x2F;storage for experimentation at home, and it&#x27;d be cool to develop closer to a real world distributed environment without footing as large a bill. I would guess I&#x27;m not the first person to have been interested in doing this, so at this point just trying not to duplicate any work if this is already a solved problem.",
