Also there are &quot;project management&quot; apps which present similar concepts constrained within the view of completing a project.<p>But I am looking for a lower level data-centric API or app. It should provide a way to log chronological events with a time, location, and attendees (and other dependencies). From there a logic of chronological flow can be established from one event to another. Any recommendations?",
