      "text": "There have been several posts of an article today that have all had several upvotes, but been flagged and removed with no warning or message as to why, and I have to assume it is because the article in question dared to suggest that maybe, just maybe the woke response to offensive situations is the wrong response and we should instead take a more thoughtful approach. Posts that have a political narrative, or have to do with schooling seem to be allowed, but only if they fit a certain narrative. You don&#x27;t flag an article on how medical equipment is racist and that&#x27;s obviously systemic, but you do flag an article on how we shouldn&#x27;t knee jerk react and be terrible people in offensive situations. It&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s an opinion article, those are all over the place, so the only explanation that I can come up with is that it was removed because it was of the wrong opinion.",
