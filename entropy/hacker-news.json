      "text": "I&#x27;m a 20 y&#x2F;o bootcamp grad with no college degree and 6 months of professional experience. I&#x27;ve been out of employment since May this year, and since mid-September I&#x27;ve been applying for software engineering positions across the US. Also I&#x27;m from Europe and I&#x27;m currently living in SF on a tourist visa, meaning I would need sponsorship for an H-1b work visa.<p>Let&#x27;s assume for a moment that I&#x27;m job searching correctly; I&#x27;m applying to places that I would actually want to work at with a relevant resume and a well-written cover letter, I&#x27;m networking on Linkedin and setting up phone calls with engineers and recruiters, I&#x27;m leveraging my existing network and reaching out to almost everyone I know, etc.<p>So far I&#x27;ve had zero responses, despite me having referrals to a bunch of companies. After getting speedily rejected from FB, even with a relatively strong recommendation, I managed to get feedback from the engineer that it&#x27;s basically because companies aren&#x27;t willing to sponsor for entry-level positions, especially if the candidate doesn&#x27;t have a degree. Is this true? Is there a limiting factor of my situation here? Why am I being ignored?<p>My resolve is starting to break because I have zero visibility on _what_ exactly is going wrong. If it&#x27;s something about my situation that doubles the bar, then that&#x27;s fineâ€“ I&#x27;ll go work in Europe for a few years, and I&#x27;ll be back in the US soon. No hard feelings. But because I know that I&#x27;m more than competent enough to hold down the positions I&#x27;m applying for, I wonder if it&#x27;s something about my situation or something that I&#x27;m doing wrong.<p>What are the conditions that companies offer sponsorship on? Is there a hard limit on the # of times a company can sponsor? Am I not being taken seriously because I&#x27;m too young? Or because my only experience was a 6 months? Is my job gap a problem?<p>Fuck all these questions though, my single biggest fear is that I&#x27;m wasting my time. I don&#x27;t care about comp or prestige, I just want to work and build things. But I&#x27;ve had to instead spend the last few months writing fucking cover letters, using all the businessy buzzwords. It&#x27;s so cringe and debilitating to me.<p>Am I doomed? Or am I being too fragile? Should I keep calm and carry on? I can do that, but I have a vauge sense of angst that I could be wasting my time without knowing it.<p>What do?",
