      "text": "I’m developing a B2B SaaS product that uses a subscription model. I’m looking at services like Okta&#x2F;Auth0&#x2F;Azure AD B2C for customer identity &amp; user account management. To manage subscriptions I’m planning to use a service like Chargebee&#x2F;Recurly&#x2F;Chargify or maybe just Stripe.<p>What I don’t see is a product that marries these 2 services. Is there a reason most SaaS companies end up developing their own licensing provisioning tools? It seems like this is another product&#x2F;service that could be offered?<p>I don’t feel my requirements are all that unique.  I basically need a customer front end that allows subscription owners to assign licenses to specific user identities.  My app would then just have to validate that the current user has an active&#x2F;paid subscription.<p>Am I overlooking a product or service that’s already out there? Or is this something I’m going to have to develop myself?",
