      "text": "Hey HN! I browse this site quite often and have finally reached a &quot;breaking point&quot; so to speak. I&#x27;m a self-taught developer located in the US and got my first dev job around 6 months ago. It&#x27;s a remote position paying just over $20p&#x2F;h. I enjoy writing software and pay wasn&#x27;t a huge factor at the time. I was just happy to collect a paycheck doing something I love.<p>However, I browse this site and frequently see 6 figures thrown around casually for Jr. Dev positions and it blows my mind. I come from a very poor family and the thought of making &quot;even&quot; $70-80k feels unrealistic. I&#x27;ve applied to job listings in and above that range, but have yet to receive so much as an email back. Skill-wise I would probably put myself a bit above the &quot;average&quot; Jr. Dev and feel I have a lot to offer, but when I every day on HN I see discussions of salaries that are several times what I make for the same job I can&#x27;t help but wonder what I&#x27;m doing wrong to not be receiving offers in these ranges.",
