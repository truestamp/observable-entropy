      "text": "Going from a novice to intermediate coder was fairly engaging, and I still find problem solving for problem solving sake an interesting use of time, but its hard to motivate myself to work on a large scale project simply for the sake of practice. I feel I am qualified to be paid to program on at least a junior level, and doing a serious project for no pay which benefits nothing but my resume is not motivating.<p>It seems common to run into the problem: &quot;If it&#x27;s useful, it&#x27;s probably already made by now.&quot; What are some projects one can work on worth more than just showing off?",

      "text": "Something I&#x27;ve recently realised is that, when I compare feelings (rather than thoughts) I derive just as much pleasure from sitting at home playing video games as I do living out &quot;dreams&quot; in the real world.<p>Its a slightly different type, of course, but joy nonetheless. Its been hugely freeing as I had been having some thirty-something angst about prior life choices (as you do).<p>In other words, its like there&#x27;s a natural &quot;limit&quot; on the happiness I can enjoy at any given moment, and going to great lengths to &quot;live the dream&quot; might be pointless.<p>Has anyone else experienced this? Perhaps if a far more common idea that I realise and there&#x27;s proper terminology for it.",
