      "text": "I&#x27;ve recently moved to Mac OS after a life on Windows and Linux (because M1 seemed quite good). I was honestly a little shocked by all of the paid apps (both one-time fee and subscription) on Mac OS. For example, Bear, RogueAmoeba apps, Fantastical, Paw, etc.<p>Have I been spoiled by FOSS? And am I being selfish for wishing these high-quality apps were free?<p>Also, an opinion question: would it be unethical for someone to clone (non-unique) features from paid apps and then release the software for free? If you spend a lot of time and effort on that, you could potentially screw over another dev&#x27;s source of income, but would it be better for everyone if high-quality applications were available to all for free?",
