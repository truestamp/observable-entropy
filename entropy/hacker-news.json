      "text": "Hey HN, I&#x27;m Mehul, founder of codedamn. I&#x27;m glad to release codedamn creator (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creator.codedamn.com&#x2F;) in public beta today - the first (and only?) interactive course creating platform available to create truly interactive programming courses.<p>Unlike existing solutions of embedding iframes from different code execution services, we have built the whole system from the ground up - allowing the course students to work inside a powerful in-browser editor solving code challenges.<p>This will enable you to create highly interactive courses on virtually any topic.<p>Want to teach people solidity by running a local blockchain inside the browser? Possible. Want to teach React.js and evaluate if they passed specific tests written in the react-testing-library? You got it. Want to build a Python course with numpy and other data science concepts having in-browser practice? You got it. Need support for Rust or Golang for an excellent course you have in mind? You got it.<p>I&#x27;ve been learning as a programmer since I was 13, and the interactive elements I saw on sites like codecademy and freeCodeCamp inspired me to develop a platform to create and sell my interactive courses. So I did that on codedamn.com.<p>After building and selling tens of interactive courses via codedamn (we do close to $3000 MRR on our in-house courses), we&#x27;re now opening this platform for other developers to come, build, and sell their interactive courses without worrying about underlying practice infrastructure.<p>You can add videos, labs, quizzes, and markdown enabled articles as individual course items at the moment. Some important information:<p>- You get the ability to host your courses on your custom domain under your branding.\n- We do not make any revenue from your sales right now. Yes, our fees is 0%. (except for fees charged by Stripe)\n- You get a free *.codedamn.dev subdomain for hosting your courses (claim at the time of registration)\n- All sales happen via Stripe.\n- All creator payouts will happen via Stripe too.<p>Interactive learning is the future. I&#x27;m looking forward to all those developers out there share their knowledge with others and make money building one of the best courses online. Happy to hear any feedback you have!",
