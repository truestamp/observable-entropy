I also think younger workers who enter the force in the next couple of years will be familiar with test proctoring software. (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4&#x2F;29&#x2F;21232777&#x2F;examity-remote-test-proctoring-online-class-education&#x2F;)<p>I guess my big question is how a WFH employee base could mobilize to stop something like proctoring software from becoming the norm. After all, unlike in a physical plant, workers scattered across the country or the globe in remote teams are not going to have the same chance to organize and garner collective bargaining power if something like this is mandated from the top down.",
