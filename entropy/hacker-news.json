I&#x27;m a solo developer, doing it in my free time, with the intention to release a great product (and make money from it).<p>I personally dislike Electron Apps and try to avoid them if possible. However I understand the appeal behind them for developers.<p>With my current time, skills and funding - I&#x27;m either able to release an Electron application with decent support for all 3 major OSes with all the drawbacks of Electron (big binary, maybe-slow [my core logic is done in Rust, and JS is used primarily for the UI], alien-looking); or a native for 1 platform, MacOS in my case.<p>I believe in having clean UI and smooth experience, hence the choice of Electron bothers me a lot. On the other side, most of the drawbacks of Electron are expressed by (mainly) tech-savvy people.<p>So, dear HN - what would you pick: Electron or MacOS Only native?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moneypin.app&#x2F;",

      "text": "A little context to come along with my question.<p>Since i graduated Greek high school i started reading books. I started wanting and needing to learn and read books. I discovered that history is not just a meaningless course that tortures you with details of the past: names, dates, locations, who f* who, who killed who etc. I discovered the beauty of books and more precises the beauty of words and the meaning behind them.<p>As a person who has dyslexia school didn&#x27;t provide me anything other than loathing for the subjects that i truly admire right now. It taught me how to fear learning and not how to learn. That fear, to this day, is still here with me. For instance, right now i want to study for my Digital Design course but every time i think about it my body fills with fear and then i&#x27;m searching for something else to procrastinate on (like writing this ASK HN thread).<p>A while ago, made the decision that, whatever i do with my life, i want learning, reading books and writing to be a fundamental part of my life, of my identity. I can&#x27;t think how my life would be without them. Like it used to be. I lament about the fact that i lost so many years not reading and learning, instead i&#x27;ve developing social media addiction and crippling fear of even trying anything i want.",
