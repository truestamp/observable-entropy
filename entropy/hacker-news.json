      "text": "I majored in CS and never really explored much outside of it, so I didn&#x27;t give myself a chance to learn about the reputable names, concepts, or theories in economics. I&#x27;m going to start applying to jobs soon and would like to learn about personal financial literacy and historical and present day economics to get a better understanding of the context before I get paid. I&#x27;m hoping learning about these things earlier can lead to making smarter moves earlier and more financial stability. If you have any books, videos, articles, podcasts, sites, or news sources or whatever else that you liked, I&#x27;d love to take a look!",
