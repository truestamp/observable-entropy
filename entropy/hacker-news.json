      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I have two projects in mind, both require web scraping (to build a dataset) and data analysis (random forest).<p>Down the line I would like to automate everything, but for now my goal is to create a process (scripts and programs) that I can perform to get my analysis as needed.<p>I&#x27;m asking for guidance on getting started with web scraping and data analysis. I have a beginner level understanding of R-Programming, which seems to be a great choice for analysis.<p>I have zero experience with web scraping. I&#x27;m trying to decide between Python, VBS and Bash scripting. I have a little experience with all three.<p>I&#x27;m also thinking about  getting some books and taking some online classes, any recommendations?<p>Thank you all in advance.<p>P.S. The projects have to do with stock market swing trading and weather patterns.",
