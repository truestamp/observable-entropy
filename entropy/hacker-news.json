      "text": "Considering the unstoppable force that they are, glacial movement while slow, have a lot of energy. I imagine there could be some glaciers that have such a long track that we have the potential to insert a quantity of anchors into the glacier and run cables from the anchors to a generator.<p>Some problems that I foresee are mechanical stresses increasing the temperature of the anchors and making them slip free. The torque would be tremendous for an initial gear at the generator, if gears are used. A suitable glacier might have to be larger than expected to accommodate a vast quantity of anchors(so that there is less force per anchor which might fracture or melt the ice). The initial gear might not be able to handle the mechanical strains and thus could not transfer the energy to remaining gears&#x2F;generator. The environmental temperature would fatigue equipment quickly.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;worlds-fastest-glacier-sermeq-kujalleq<p>&gt; Sermeq Kujalleq, also called Jakobshavn glacier, is known as the world’s fastest glacier. Like rivers, glaciers are constantly flowing, pushed forward by the weight of their own ice. This one travels an average of 130 feet in 24 hours and calves more than 11 cubic miles of icebergs each year into the Ilulissat Icefjord.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20140222172708&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu&#x2F;tbw&#x2F;ncc&#x2F;Notes&#x2F;chap3.landforms&#x2F;erosion.deposition&#x2F;glaciers.htm<p>&gt; flow velocity in a glacier is greatest near the surface of the ice and decreases towards the bottom.\nglaciers typically move 1000 feet a year, about 10 inches a day although some move more rapidly.<p>I am not able to calculate how much electricity could be generated.",
