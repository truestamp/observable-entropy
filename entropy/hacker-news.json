      "text": "Hello everyone, I’ve been a HN reader for a long time and this is my first time posting here.<p>I’m currently doing my thesis for a CS degree about to graduate, but I don’t have internship or work experience any other than the work on my university courses.<p>I would appreciate any suggestions to prepare for the HR, behavioral and technical interviews and how all of the interview process works. Should I grind Leetcode or specialize in a specific framework?<p>I also get lost when I start searching for a job since all of them ask for a lot of qualifications that I don’t feel prepared for, hence I feel like I have to prepare and prepare but never actually apply for any job since I&#x27;m stuck in this &quot;preparing loop&quot; where I don&#x27;t have a path to follow. I’m lost and not sure what to do or where to start.<p>Lastly, for economic reasons, I have a part time job (~30 hours a week) which is hard work and not tech related at all, which also makes me think about on what to spend my time on, whether to focus on my thesis, or preparing for interviews, or both? I&#x27;ve even considered getting a job as a help desk or something since my current job is very exhausting working under the heat, but again, I don&#x27;t know what keywords to use when searching for a job. I don&#x27;t have any contacts  since I&#x27;m a (legal) immigrant and recently moved here (USA). I&#x27;d appreciate any advise for this.",
