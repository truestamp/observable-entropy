We are building a market-category-defining cloud data security company for the dynamic world of the data and app ecosystem. We are backed by top-tier VCs, and angel investors as CEOs and security leaders from Google, Stripe, Facebook, etc. The founding team consists of serial entrepreneurs and early engineers from startups and cloud scale companies. We are looking for product managers (customer obsessed PMs), system engineers (Golang), product and platform security engineers, fullstack developers (React), and DevOps engineers (CI&#x2F;CD, Grafana, K8s, etc.) with hands-on experiences with cloud-native and SaaS products. Open for fall and winter interns (PhD and MS only). You will play a critical role in building products working closely with our early customers, founders, and collaborating with senior engineers who have built and shipped $1B+ products (alumni from Google, Facebook, Nutanix, Rubrik, ZScaler, Netskope, AWS, IBM Research). You will gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies (Kafka, Docker, K8s, etc.) and many others from the open-source world. We are looking for characteristics such as ambition and agility, commitment to build an enduring product and an enduring company, self-driven and self-motivated, diverse and growth mindsets, and intellectual curiosity to innovate!
