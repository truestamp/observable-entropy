      "text": "Hi HN!<p>We&#x27;re happy to announce the launch of Mapedia.org, an open source crowdsourced learning map!\nMapedia is a new kind of learning platform at the crossroad between Wikipedia, Google Maps and Khan Academy: a learning map built collaboratively to support online learners to learn any topic seamlessly.<p>We built an interactive learning map of topics to be able to visualize the different fields of knowledge, what concepts are included in them and how they relate to each other. This allows for curiosity based exploration, identifying knowledge gaps (unknown unknowns) and figuring out what to learn next (and in which order).\nFor each topic you can then find community and expert curated resources, learning advices and smart recommendations in order to learn as efficiently as possible.<p>We want people to spend time learning rather than figuring out how to learn, and in particular to empower self-directed learners. \nThe idea came out of the frustration and inefficiency of learning online, and I&#x27;ve been working on it for 2 years now. The vision in itself for it is not so new, Mapedia is rather a different take on it that particularly believes in the potential of crowdsourcing and online communities. Our roadmap includes implementing learning groups based on shared goals rather than shared course&#x2F;learning material, customizable &quot;constructive&quot; feeds of learning materials and adaptive learning paths.<p>The topic map is obviously far from complete and we are still in the early product iterations, but you can checkout a few examples here:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;explore\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;explore</a> -&gt; The explore map from the top level topics<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;explore?selectedTopicId=AvgsEAdEM&amp;mapType=CONCEPTS\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;explore?selectedTopicId=AvgsEAdEM&amp;mapTyp...</a> -&gt; the map focused on functional programming, showing how concepts relate to each other<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;functional_programming_(programming_paradigms)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;functional_programming_(programmi...</a> -&gt; the  page for the functional programming topic, with curated resources<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;learning_paths&#x2F;learning_how_to_code_only_with_games\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;learning_paths&#x2F;learning_how_to_code_only...</a> -&gt; an example of a learning path (this feature is in a very alpha version)<p>Let us know what you think!
