I&#x27;m slowly realizing our codebase is too lax regarding automated tests, and frankly code quality in general (e.g. no teamwide style guide).<p>This must lead to a lot of problems which I&#x27;ll only face after ramping up, but even onboarding is painful if you don&#x27;t have e.g. clear automated testing set up.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the industry for about 10 years and testing has always been an important part of the job. I guess I saw it as a given; to me part of the job _is_ writing tests. I assumed this was fairly obvious in 2021.<p>How should I approach this with the team and my manager? Keep in mind I&#x27;m new and a IC, not very senior. Others in the team might already have struck this chord in the past as well. Or perhaps I should drink the cool-aid and shut up.",
