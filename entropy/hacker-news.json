However, I know it can be a bit frustrating and difficult for a lot of people.<p>I expect to find some resistance, but I truly care about their experience and want them to feel well - hopefully better - in their new environment.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear about individual experiences and also maybe from IT departments that went through a similar process - changing from Windows to Linux.<p>What was the most difficult thing when doing the transition? What do you like and especially dislike about the new platform?<p>For example, a lot of these artists are creating images for blockbuster movies&#x2F;shows and care a lot about the small details. Things like ugly or fragmented interfaces are sometimes OK for analytic&#x2F;engineering people, but they can ruin an artist&#x27;s experience.<p>Anything else that I should pay attention to?",
