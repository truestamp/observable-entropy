After contacting support, a week later  I eventually learn that my XRP address was added to an exclusion list. This means I get nothing. The total amount that I am owed is easily in the thousands of dollars over the duration of the airdrop (which is over a three-year period):<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flare.xyz&#x2F;further-information-on-the-spark-token-distribution&#x2F;<p>It says:<p><i>Other than Ripple inc and the non-participating exchanges, there are a few groups that are completely excluded from the distribution. These are Jed McCaleb and accounts that are known to have received XRP as a result of fraud, theft and scams.</i><p>So I am guessing they assume my XRP was fraudulently obtained, so I get nothing. However I never engaged in fraud. I received XRP in 2020 as payment, but how was I supposed to know at the time something was wrong? That is not the issue, the issue is I am excluded for a lot of money.<p>So what should my next step be. The holding company is in the UK:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xrpchat.com&#x2F;topic&#x2F;38453-company-incorporation-info-for-flare-networks&#x2F;<p>I am not even sure what the assessed damages will be given that the airdrop has not actually commenced yet, or if there is any way to proceed legally.",
