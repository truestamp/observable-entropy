      "text": "I’ve been searching for an app to enhance my planning and reporting as a creative freelancer, and I feel like Neo at the start of the Matrix at this point. So much searching.<p>Currently I just plan my days with time blocks in my calendar (using iCloud for what it’s worth). When I need to invoice a client I then just have to go through the calendar weeks and note the blocks for that client manually. It’s a stupid system.<p>I’ve tried using some freelancer &#x2F; small business apps like Harvest or Cushion, but I have found that they are a bit much for what I need to do.<p>I have tried apps like Trello and Notion more recently, and they make a lot more sense, except both have drawbacks.<p>What I think I need in an app is:\n- multiple views including list, kanban and timeline\n- a calendar view for scheduling &#x2F; planning\n- calendar sync of some kind would be great, but not an absolute must\n- ability to tally up the time I have spent on a given project\n- ideally offline usable\n- strong preference for pay once. I’d feel much better about paying $100 (or whatever appropriate amount) for software once than $10 a month on a subscription.\n- not needed: any team oriented features. I have no team.<p>Hoping I can get some help on this as I’m driving myself insane.",
