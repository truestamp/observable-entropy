      "text": "I like the databaseless idea of todo.txt but it&#x27;s very complicated to manage projects with complex tasks. Only easy todos like &quot;walk with a dog&quot; or &quot;read a book&quot;. I like taskwarrior and dstask as proof of concept, but come on, to add a task with needed tags and parent I need to write literally five times as much as task is. I don&#x27;t have such a good memory to remember all the tags and flags that are out there. I like Org-Mode, but I&#x27;m Vim user (un)fortunately.<p>So please, post here task&#x2F;project&#x2F;todo management software that you found really nice and useful. That have tags, maybe trees, maybe something else. CLI, TUI or GUI.",
