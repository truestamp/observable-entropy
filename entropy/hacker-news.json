To reset the password, Google keeps sending a verification code to the same email of the account that I&#x27;m trying to reset the password for.<p>I really do not get the point, I do not have the account logged in on any of my devices. I have tried all the previously used devices to reset the password from. It still keeps sending the code to the same email.<p>It&#x27;s an account I use for AdSense and I have unpaid revenue in there. I have literally tried 5 different devices that I have used the account on, I can verify the phone number but then it keeps asking me to verify a code that&#x27;s sent on the same email.<p>Now that I&#x27;m trying potential passwords, it asks me to solve a captcha everytime and I&#x27;ve tried so many times that it says I&#x27;ve entered the captcha wrong even though it&#x27;s correct. We&#x27;re 3 people literally looking at that and solving it and it&#x27;s done that 10s of times.",
