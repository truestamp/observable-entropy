      "text": "I came across a word in the Postgres source code that I&#x27;d never seen before: &quot;frammish&quot;.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;postgres&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;backend&#x2F;storage&#x2F;lmgr&#x2F;lwlock.c :<p>&gt; Therefore, they offer both exclusive and shared lock modes (to support\n&gt; read&#x2F;write and read-only access to a shared object).  There are few other\n&gt; frammishes.  User-level locking should be done with the full lock manager\n&gt; --- which depends on LWLocks to protect its shared state.<p>It sort of makes sense in context, as a &quot;feature&quot; or a &quot;flourish&quot;. It also appears on the pg_hackers mailing list:<p>&gt; There has been some talk of separating the power to create new users\n&gt; from the power of being superuser (although presumably only a superuser\n&gt; should be allowed to create new superusers).  If the planned pg_role\n&gt; rewrite gets submitted before the 8.1 feature freeze, I might look at\n&gt; adding that frammish into it.<p>and here, from 19 years ago:<p>&gt; And we get ragged on regularly for the non-SQL-standard features we&#x27;ve\n&gt; inherited from Berkeley Postgres (eg, the implicit-FROM frammish that \n&gt; was under discussion yesterday).<p>No amount of googling turns up a formal definition or usage outside of the Postgres community. &quot;frammish.org&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be related.<p>Are Postgres developers starting to evolve their own dialect? Should we call an anthropologist?",
