      "text": "I am a little late to the party but after all of the discussion about the shutdown of Fast, I started thinking about the one click checkout business model more and companies that are still pursuing it like Bolt.<p>A common similarity between all of these one click checkout business models is the decision to offer one click checkout via a server side integration. One of the main takeaways I observed from reading about the downfall of Fast is that while a server side integration offers better security and much more control over the checkout experience and the data that is exchanged, this model has a massive cost of maintenance, integration, and sales that make margins extremely tight.<p>My question is why we have not seen any of these companies take the opposite approach and offer the service client side? It seems like an easier and more cost effective route to just complete checkout on behalf of the user, and many apps like 1Pass already offer an autofill feature so it must be feasible to some extent. I must be missing something here and I don&#x27;t have enough knowledge about frontend technology to answer my own question.",
