      "text": "I&#x27;ve just recently become aware of a few companies pursuing long range &#x27;wireless power&#x27;. I only have a very basic physics understanding of it -- IIRC magnetic field strength, which I assume is what&#x27;s being used (like wireless iPhone, toothbrush chargers), is inversely proportional to distance (1&#x2F;r). Does anyone have any numbers on how this actually makes sense as a long range power source? If multiple sources were using long range &#x27;wireless power&#x27;, wouldn&#x27;t the magnetic fields become non-uniform (non circular) and therefore mess it all up. How is this a feasible infrastructure solution? I have only a basic understanding of this concept from classical physics, so this question might be naive.",
