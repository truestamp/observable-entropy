      "text": "The gist of this question is, what can I do differently so as to work fewer hours and have more time for enjoying life?<p>I&#x27;m the sole income earner and need to provide for my family. I find it difficult to put in all the hours I need to in a day. (Theoretically, I&#x27;m a salaried employee, but I also need to account for eight hours five days a week).<p>I want to be there for my family. My son built a game and would like to put it up on the internet. My wife has written a novel and it needs proof-reading, and so on.<p>I go to bed tired and wake up the same way. I am actively looking into improving my health. I did just get back from a vacation, but, well, needed a vacation from my vacation.<p>What can I do?<p>I haven&#x27;t talked to HR where I work. Would that accomplish anything? (I am a programmer, and am in demand; maybe there isn&#x27;t too much downside). Maybe I could ask to work fewer hours in a day -- but I fear that might mean I lose benefits. [I would expect to be paid less; I would have to weight the pros and cons].<p>Starting my own business -- I tried; it went nowhere. (I did learn a fair bit, high among it being that I can&#x27;t stand marketing). And I don&#x27;t have the oomph for a side-gig right now.<p>Looking for other jobs -- maybe. Suppose I did; are other employers likely to, say, let me work six hour days?<p>I did look into taking a stress leave. Here in Alberta, Canada, I could do that for a few weeks, and get something like half my income from the government, which honestly is great, but even though I wouldn&#x27;t say money is tight, it would be a struggle to get by.",
