      "text": "I&#x27;ve been learning about zero trust systems, homomorphic encryption etc. There are new startups in that areas who are trying to provide the technology.<p>What I have hard time finding are companies using these technologies. It&#x27;s also unintuitive why would they do it, given that they feed on user data.<p>I can see how this could work for b2b, in a non-zero sum game where both companies gain by being able to do for eg. zero-knowledge proof, or share some encrypted data for processing.<p>I would like to hear your take on these questions:\n- have your company used FHE? where &amp; why?\n- can you think of b2c where business have incentive to use FHE?\n- do you think that because there will be zero-trust alternatives, users will choose those, and other will have to follow?<p>thanks &amp; have a good Sunday!",
