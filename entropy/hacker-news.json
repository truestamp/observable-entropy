Mostly because I turn into a hot mess and lose organization when discussing my experiences during interviews.<p>I&#x27;ve done some of the typical stuff like writing down key points and rehearing answers  ahead of the interview. I also seem to do ok with the coaches I&#x27;ve occasionally enlisted.<p>Love to hear from someone who has solved a similar problem.<p>I am also curious how and how much do most people practice (esp the ones who aren&#x27;t exactly glib talkers)",
