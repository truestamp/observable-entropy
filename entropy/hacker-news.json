      "text": "We have been with stripe for over 2 years and on Sept 2, they shut us down without explanation.  We tried to reach them and their help and call button have been disabled.  We are a small online gym and since they shut us down, its been impossible to reach someone for help.\nSince then we have not been able to generate any revenue so we have lost thousands of dollars.  We have employees that depend on us and not being to generate any income has been a tremendous burden.\nWe decided to move to another payment partner and Stripe has still not sent us the file with our customer data so we can move on.\nWhat else do we have to do for the file migration?  We have done and provided everything you requested and we have not heard from your technician and you are not responding to emails.<p>Carol Price\n8136108294",
