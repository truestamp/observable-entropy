      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>Flowful is a collection of ambient music generators designed to fade into the background while you work.<p>I made Flowful out of frustration with ambient music playlists on streaming platforms either skewing my recommendations, or launching me into something very distracting once the playlist is finished.<p>The music is procedurally generated real time in your browser using Javascript by piecing together a bunch of custom-recorded samples.<p>Its free to try without an account, and the premium tracks rotate to become free on a weekly basis, meaning if you wait long enough, all the tracks would have had their turn on the free week.<p>There are currently around 20 tracks (not including the combinations) and I plan on adding one or two new tracks each week (or whenever inspiration strikes).<p>Any and all feedback is very appreciated! :)",
