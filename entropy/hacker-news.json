      "text": "Many argue that the right&#x2F;left political divide is particularly pronounced at the moment in the United States - perhaps too much so.<p>I&#x27;m not for a moment suggesting that this problem should be &quot;solved&quot; per se - a healthy political divide is necessary for the exchange and development of ideas. But I wonder if there&#x27;s a way to render it more effective, and at least mitigate the seemingly visceral divide in American society. Any ideas on how the internet could help in this realm (for once)?<p>What about a website where ordinary citizens of opposing views get matched up, and are forced to have a video call with one another on a particular issue e.g. abortion. I presume a video call with a stranger would somewhat encourage &quot;listening&quot; and general &quot;politeness&quot;, more so than on Twitter&#x2F;Facebook.<p>Maybe you could record the calls and post them for others to watch.<p>Any thoughts on this topic?",
