      "text": "Dataplane is the data platform that makes it far easier for your data team to build and scale a data mesh with automated data pipelines and workflows.<p>It is early days for Dataplane with the first beta release. Still much to do! I would love to hear your thoughts and for you to get involved.<p>Go check out the demo at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dataplane.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dataplane.app</a> or use the quick start guide to install a cluster locally using either Docker Compose or Minikube.<p>Here are the highlights:<p>* Written in Golang and compiled to machine code for extreme performance with a low memory and CPU footprint. Front end built in React with secure JWT tokens, real-time Websockets and GraphQL.\n* No code drag and drop data pipeline builder.\n* Built in online Python code editor – no more configuring developer spec laptops for your data team to get going or to train new data team members.\n* Granular permissions for teams to collaborate with segregated access.\n* Secrets management with logging redaction allows team members to use secure resources without revealing passwords or API keys.\n* Scheduler with multiple time zone support and per second scheduling.\n* Setup isolated environments to develop, test &amp; deploy across data mesh domains.\n* Distributed computing with worker groups. You can configure different types of workers for different parts of a data pipeline, for example, NLP or AI deep learning workers versus vanilla Python with pandas data frame workers.\n* Monitor worker nodes in real-time resource usage and logging.\n* A Dataplane cluster can horizontally scale to many instances connected over a NATS message bus, providing self-healing, resilience and scale – this includes leader election and distribution locking for data pipeline run time safety.\n* Cloud native – deploy and scale on Kubernetes in your favourite cloud provider.",
