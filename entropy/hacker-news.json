      "text": "Hi HN<p>I am about to blow a gasket! Is there someone on here who has managed to create a stable jupyter lab  setup using vim mode? I am constantly switching between two subpar solutions:<p>1) Use Jupyter lab GUI + Jupyter lab vim extension. The vim extension is super unstable and inconsistent, for example pressing &quot;ESC&quot; you can not enter insert mode again without manually clicking a code cell.<p>2) Use VScode and connect to local Jupyter server and use Vim extension from VScode. Here Vim works fine, but VScode has an infuriating input lag, I type and then 2 seconds later the input appears.<p>Wondering if anyone on here has found a stable setup?",
