      "text": "In light of recent news, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg suggests the search engine will now filter results based on recent political events [1]. For those considering or aware of alternatives, what are they?<p>For me, DuckDuckGo was supposed to represent private (not selling user data), unbiased (i.e. apolitical), fast search results. Ideally a replacement would meet as many of these goals as possible. Some alternatives I&#x27;m aware of:<p>* Searx - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searx.github.io&#x2F;searx&#x2F;<p>* Brave search - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;search.brave.com&#x2F;<p>Note this is not a discussion about the morality of DuckDuckGo&#x27;s recent actions.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;duck-duck-go-reverses-course-will-demote-russian-propaganda-in-search-results-014336389.html",
