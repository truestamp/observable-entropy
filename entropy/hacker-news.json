      "text": "Product Hunt was once a curated collection of interesting new products, shared to a small newsletter list of enthusiasts.<p>Today, it has become a pyramid scheme of paid upvotes, shill accounts, and rampant spam. And nobody is talking about it.<p>Have a look at Today&#x27;s #2Product of the Day with 500+ upvotes. They are ALL sock puppet accounts, and most comments and upvotes within a short period of time.<p>The comments are all obvious astro-turfing, with names like &quot;AccountHolder2&quot;. Most of the other top products of the day have the same problem. See for yourself here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;teyuto-2<p>Something is deeply rotten with Product Hunt. There are maybe 2 or 3 posts in the top products of the day that aren&#x27;t full of utter garbage comments from fake accounts.<p>I shared a link to this before and it was marked as Dead. I&#x27;m assuming because the system thought it was promoting someone&#x27;s Product Hunt launch rather than pointing out a huge failing in one of the most  important communities online.<p>Most upvotes are commercially driven. It seems like something that could be fixed with reasonable moderation.",
