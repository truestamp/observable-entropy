One of the things I struggle with is communicating and collaborating with other teams that are working on the project or working on something similar and relevant. I try to schedule sync meetings with key members of other teams and stakeholders, but those often lose steam after a few meetings. It&#x27;s much easier for me to work in isolation without with my team without all the distraction, but that&#x27;s not ideal for the company.",
