      "text": "This is a re-post from 2011. \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2282875<p>While talking about the Windows 1.0 to Windows 7 upgrade video, I offhandedly made a joke at Trumpet Winsock&#x27;s expense[1].\nIn the comment below, nailer mentioned that the creator of Trumpet Winsock saw very little money from one of the most widely-used pieces of shareware then in existence. Magazines and ISPs distributed the full version of his software but very few paid for it[2].<p>My first experience connecting to the internet was using Windows 3.1, Trumpet Winsock and Netscape 1.22 (I think) to browse the nascent web. Later I wiled away (too many) hours on IRC.<p>At the time I didn&#x27;t have two 50c coins to rub together. Today, partly due to that early internet exposure, I am a well-paid software engineer.<p>In the same thread I have alluded to you will find that we identified Peter Tattam and two of us (badmonkey0001 and I) contacted him independently.<p>At our prompting Peter has set up a Paypal account where you can make donations. I invite you to chip in to reward a man whose work let so many of us open the door, for the first time, to an important part of our lives.<p>Thanks, Peter.<p>---------------------------------------------<p>Donate to payments@petertattam.com<p>---------------------------------------------<p>Edit: now cross-posted at Reddit in non-karma-harvesting format (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reddit.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fwciq&#x2F;peter_tattam_created_trumpet_winsock_enabling&#x2F;)<p>[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2281698 [2] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=2281770",
