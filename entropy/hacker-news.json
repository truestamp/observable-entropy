I was excited to join a big company and had interest in finance as SWE. But those dream didn&#x27;t manifest. I&#x27;ve started interviewing. But HR has been making my life hell. Everyday they call me, WFH, and give me list of &quot;violations&quot;. Late to meeting by n minutes, slack wasn&#x27;t green at 11pm, didn&#x27;t complete x points last sprint... etc.<p>My question should I wait to find new job or get fired, or just quit now.<p>I&#x27;m never working for loser corporations, where all toxic boomers gather up in HR. Like you must get off making people miserable, some people seek purpose and impact in their work, and some might be like oh boy can&#x27;t wait to see that employee crack under pressure, I think today is the day, lets see what bs I can pull this morning. I mean how sad you have to be that&#x27;s the bar of self fulfilment.<p>Teammates: A+<p>Processes: C-<p>Management: F-<p>HR: Cancer",
