      "text": "Strange (or maybe not so strange?) thing happened.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a good name &amp; .com domain for a product for some time now. Just tried a new guess and the .com is available. I was quite enthusiastic about this option. Or so I thought...<p>It just so happens that the previous owner was a person that died from cancer couple of years ago and hosted some semi personal stuff there - judging from a quick read on web.archive.org, mostly promoted their books, but the topic of disease was present and books were somewhat related.<p>Apparently there was no one around them who would take care of the site and pay for the domain (or maybe there was, but they decided it was better not to). Related Facebook account is deleted, too. OTOH books are available on Amazon.<p>Now I don&#x27;t feel like taking this domain would be the right move. Both emotionally and business wise.<p>Curious if you have any thoughts or maybe have seen some similar situations.",
