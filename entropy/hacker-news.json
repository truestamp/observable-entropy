However, the company now believes developers don&#x27;t need QA since they can do their own testing.  Devs should write code, do all their unit, int, system testings, run their code reviews, save testing artifacts, and work with key stakeholders across the company to close requirements gaps etc.  We&#x27;re basically the entire sdlc minus devops.<p>This is great for small features, but it gives me pause for mid or large features.
