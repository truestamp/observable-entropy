      "text": "Occasionally a link to a tweet will be submitted here as a story by itself. Unfortunately twitter is going the direction of quora, pinterest, and medium by making the site nearly unusable without an account. Until a few days ago you could read all the tweets you wanted but clicking any of them would pop up a “join twitter” screen. Now you can perhaps read ten tweets or replies to a linked tweet without an account before the same thing occurs.",
