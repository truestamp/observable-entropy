      "text": "Hello, I started working on a side project during my free time, and I was thinking of converting it into a side hustle. The side project involves ensuring data-integrity and ownership of a file by storing metadata about it in blockchain (the actual file isn&#x27;t stored). I was thinking of letting others use it, but what if it&#x27;s not secure enough? What if people use it and something happens, would I be in hot water?<p>Once I develop the project enough, I do plan to make it open source, and only after that I would launch. At least that&#x27;s the plan. I was wondering how to do good enough security audits on your own when the software is finally built. As I am merely a sophomore in college, I can&#x27;t afford professionals for the same.<p>What do you guys suggest?",
