It would be so easy too- keep the existing version free but create an iOS&#x2F;Android app with some bells and whistles like longer words and boom rake in the cash. Being so hell bent on your vision commands respect. But I can&#x27;t help but feel that the guy is about to let someone else benefit from his creation and am not sure how to feel about that (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zachshakked&#x2F;status&#x2F;1481345622938685443).<p>Apple is cracking down on blatant Wordle clones in the appstore right now but there is demand there, there is going to be a different app with a different name with a different ui with some added features like multiplayer that is probably gonna make some good money for a few months.<p>If someone is gonna inevitably end up benefiting from it, I&#x27;d rather the guy who made the original rather than an app cloning team in China or some bay area tech bro. I am putting myself in his shoes and even if I had the vision that he has, I would not be able to stop myself from monetizing it even if just to not let the copycats make as much of a windfall.<p>What do people here think of this situation?",
