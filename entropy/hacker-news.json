      "text": "Hi Hackernews!<p>Longtime lurker here, and I finally have a question.<p>We have an existing product with a file archive as part of the feature set. Currently files are stored in MSSQL in the same database as the rest of the data. This isn&#x27;t ideal, since it leads to long backup&#x2F;restore cycles, not great performance, and expensive database SSD storage. The larger instances (single tenant) are ~2-3 TB of which 90% are files, but we predict file archive usage only going up.<p>Requirements:\n- On premise hosting\n- Search file contents (Word&#x2F;Excel&#x2F;PPT support)\n- Good backup support (differential backups would be great!)",
