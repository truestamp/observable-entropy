The value of local currency against dollar is depreciating every day.\nThe only way out of this is to bring in more dollars. I have no clue how effective it would be though.\nI would like to know if you were to hire from Sri Lanka, what is your considerations be? are there any factors limiting that decision?<p>We need outside help now. More remote jobs from abroad can help us bring more dollars into the country.\nIf you can hire more Sri Lankans for open positions in your company, please do it.\nAnd also share what do you think below. Thank you.",
