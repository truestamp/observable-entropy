But it&#x27;s also disheartening that these companies are very vocal about a stance in environmental protection while they stand to burn tons of rocket fuel and create a space tourism industry that will certainly not help environmental protection efforts.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that all the burnt rocket fuel and heat generation and that sending rockets into the atmosphere will not amplify our path towards peril. It would make a lot more sense if we just gave all the funding and authorization back to NASA and accountable scientists if you ask me. It also bewilders me that government would allow this level of pollution for vanity purposes, including launching a car into space for no reason (a few years ago) when we&#x27;ve already got a growing &quot;space junk&quot; problem brewing too.<p>How destructive to the environment are these &quot;space tourism&quot; trips?",
