      "text": "I&#x27;m a founder of a tech startup and I have been trying to get my product in front of companies in the field (automotive&#x2F;AV). However, I am fairly new when it comes to how B2B sales&#x2F;intros work in this field.<p>I recently gave a technical overview of our product to an R&amp;D group with a pretty well known brand name with the potential promise of introducing me to companies in their network if there was a good fit. It initially seemed odd to me that an R&amp;D company would introduce an external startup to their network but I decided to go through with it because they had a fairly well known automotive brand associated with them.<p>They also asked me to share my slides with them so that they could share it with their team and other companies.<p>I was wondering whether this sort of thing was normal and if there were any risks with sharing my slide deck with them.<p>Do such organizations in Silicon Valley generally operate ethically or is shady behavior the norm?",
