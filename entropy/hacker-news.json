Is this idea worth further development?\n2. Have you seen any potential use cases of it?\n3. Are you interested in trying it when MVP&#x2F;v1 is ready? If yes, would you like to share your email for contact.<p>Appreciate any comments&#x2F;feedback, it helps me to decide what to build, reach out cao@columns.ai",
