      "text": "Hey HN, I had a great time working yesterday to the sweet tunes of Alan Kay&#x27;s OOPSLA talk &quot;The Computer Revolution Hasn&#x27;t Happened Yet&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY) -- it really got the creative juices flowing. I love that kind of stuff. Douglas Engelbart&#x27;s &quot;The Mother of All Demos&quot; is another good hacker classic -- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY.<p>I&#x27;m seeking more content in that wheelhouse. What are your favorite hacker talks or presos?",
