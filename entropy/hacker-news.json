      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I really into NFT and believe that it can be a perfect fit for mass adoption in the future. If you&#x27;re an NFT creator or collector let&#x27;s talk!<p>Just imagine people can collect NFT&#x27;s to own a little piece of the internet while it belongs to all internet users. Having a piece of the internet that&#x27;s fundamentally yours — something that you think is beautiful and unique and special — is not something we’ve been able to do until now. Or you can support your favorite artist, brand, or community by collecting their NFT&#x27;s.<p>Right now I see several problems:<p>1. It is hard to create, sell or buy an NFT because of the poor UX of crypto billings. You need to set up your wallet, buy some crypto, spent it on gas and etc. This problem is similar for both creators and NFT collectors. I see it&#x27;s as a bottleneck for mass adoption. Maybe it is needed to create a simple payment system that connects your credit card with crypto so you can buy NFT just like you buy any other stuff on Amazon. Something like Stripe for NFT.<p>2. There&#x27;s a lot of competition between creators on popular marketplaces. Most talented creators need to promote themselves and learn how to sell, while they want just to create a new type of art.<p>3. There&#x27;s no place to show your NFT collection. When in the offline world we can go to galleries or museums, online we only have marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible.<p>If you&#x27;re an NFT creator, collector or just interested in it let&#x27;s talk to find out what we can do with that!",
