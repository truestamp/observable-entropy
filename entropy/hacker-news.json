I&#x27;m not gonna tell anything about my education either because they don&#x27;t require any bachelor certificate. They have system design interview, some coding interview and some behavioral interview. Now I&#x27;m learning system design, CP, and also building a project with golang. What should I do to increase my chance of being accepted? Thank you",
