      "text": "Hello everyone, how do you hire remote workers abroad? Meaning that they work from their countries permanently and never come to your country.<p>So this is not a work visa or anything, I&#x27;m talking about full time remote work.<p>For example, imagine you have a small self-bootstrapped company company in Belgium (my case), and you want to have a few full-time workers in India (developers and content creators for example).<p>How does that work? Can they just issue you invoices as freelancers in euros and that&#x27;s it?<p>Or do they need to have their own company?<p>What happens if they don&#x27;t have a company?<p>Would using an intermediate platform like Upwork help in any way?<p>I understand no one here is probably a lawyer, and I will take the advice with a grain of salt and confirm with a professional.<p>But I would love to know about the feedback and personal experience of other entrepreneurs in a similar situation.",
