      "text": "Over the years I&#x27;ve started many, many side projects and most of them were completed but never launched because I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked and couldn&#x27;t improve them.<p>Common advice for people like me is to use a framework and&#x2F;or template. I&#x27;ve used bootstrap in the past which is fine for very simple apps, but I struggle with anything even remotely complicated. I&#x27;ve spent money on premium bootstrap themes but the end result never looks the way I imagined.<p>I&#x27;ve also hired a couple of designers on odesk with no success. I showed them what I was working on and explained how it worked. I basically got back the same thing with different colors.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to express exactly what I find difficult. I see webapps like notion, github, basecamp etc and by comparison, my stuff just looks terrible. Has anyone here struggled with design before and what did you do about it?",
