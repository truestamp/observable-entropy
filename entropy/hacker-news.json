      "text": "Hi guys!<p>We&#x27;ve been working on Kolor having your previous feedback in mind and here we are with the second version of the app.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.kolor.social&#x2F;<p>We need your feedback!<p>Go ahead and try it. Posting is free, you just sign the post with your wallet. You also have the ability to save it to blockchain or mint it as NFT.<p>Right now it&#x27;s running on Ropsten Testnet and Binance Smart Chain, but soon we are planning to deploy on all popular blockchains and integrate them into the dapp (multi-chain integration is live).<p>Feel free to comment all your thoughts. We need to know whether Kolor makes sense.<p>Thanks in advance!",
