I am not sure if I can rest &amp; vest in my company but assuming I can I wonder whether resting &amp; vesting would solve my burnout. At the current stock price I should probably interview &amp; rest and vest elsewhere.<p>1. What is life like after you are done resting &amp; vesting?<p>2. Does resting and vesting fix burnouts? I&#x27;d be on call every four weeks &amp; be attending meetings and doing some work on the non on call week.<p>3. I am the kind of person who likes doing things &amp; growing. Resting &amp; vesting makes me paranoid about future job prospects &amp; burning present time where I could be doing those things. Would I just lie in the interviews about my past few years and then work hard in the next job if I choose to?<p>I wonder if resting &amp; vesting would fix my burnout. I tend to feel guilty for not working while getting paid well(all things considered).",

If we were coordinated, could we not solve some major problems in the world instead?<p>I first had this thought years ago when I would drive past fields of young and adult sports teams practicing and competing.  I pondered what they could do if they offered one day a month, with guidance, to improve their town.  There are some organizations such as Habitat for Humanity and many others who do this, but it is still much smaller scale than the number of available people who already give their time to team efforts.<p>We here are largely underutilized, creating our own challenges to solve (outside of the workplace).  What if we could identify a few major challenges which would serve humanity while also giving us something interesting to tackle?",
