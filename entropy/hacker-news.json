      "text": "I’ve been wondering this a lot lately. Apple’s photo processing is just phenomenal. (You could probably say the same about other high end smartphone makers too)<p>Moreover, popular camera software and build quality is just solidly “okay” in my experience.<p>My thought is that if Apple were to produce full-size cameras, they would be far better than anything else on the market. I would probably buy one immediately.<p>I’m wondering why they haven’t done it. Maybe making cameras is really hard? Cameras are too much of a commodity and the market is really saturated? Full size lenses are hard? Not enough profit margins? Maybe it would cannibalize iPhone sales?<p>I’m curious to know what others think about a full-size Apple camera.",
