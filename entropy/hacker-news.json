      "text": "Hello dear community,<p>I have been working single-mindedly on my first MVP since last fall.  I am so glad that I am now just a couple of weeks away from finishing it. My app runs on the desktop and helps users doing data science.<p>I can&#x27;t multi-task easily so this has been my main focus for nearly a year.  Now however I realize I need to spend another couple of months to iron out the next step.  I am getting worried now because I have no idea what that is.<p>My main goal is to put the whole thing on automatic meaning let it grow on the side, give it until the end of the year and if it is successful by then, doing it full time. Otherwise, I will just move on.<p>So, my big question, what do I do next and are there low cost sites that can do it for me?",
