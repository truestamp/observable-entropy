      "text": "When is the price of a good at Amazon so competitive that it&#x27;s worth spending the money at, arguably, a pretty rotten company. For example: &quot;Music Theory for the Bass Player: A Comprehensive and Hands-on Guide to Playing with More Confidence and Freedom by Ariane Cap&quot;, is one of the best books for beginning bassists.<p>With shipping but before tax: \n- On Amazon, it&#x27;s $31.45 \n- Better World, a social benefit bookseller, it&#x27;s $44\n- Bookshop.org, which links readers to independent bookshops it&#x27;s $38.45\n- Barnes and Noble, $34.95  \n- Even gave Walmart a go: $31.45, the only company to match Amazon - although FakeSpot suggested a WalMart seller for $30.45.<p>Until FakeSpot&#x27;s suggestion, I was going to go with Barnes and Noble, reasoning that at least it&#x27;s a brick and mortar bookstore. Not exhaustive, but an interesting cross section. Given this list, at which price point &quot;is Amazon worth it&quot; for you? Why?<p>To put other ways: How much above Amazon are you willing to pay to shop at a local or independent seller?<p>How does one calculate that from an economic perspective, and is it growing, or shrinking?",
