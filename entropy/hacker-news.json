But as a privacy orientated company and mailprovider, why do you submit so much e-mail header information?<p>Your mail-header is really full with information not everyone else needs to have.<p>I just found out, that you&#x27;re stripping sender IP information when sending mails (in the past you had to choose an extra smtp &#x27;565&#x27; port for it).\nThat&#x27;s nice, as you internally know the IPs - but no one else (no receiver needs to know my sending IP!).<p>But why not also strip the X-Mailer entry AND \nalso delete information within the Mime Version entry?<p>No one needs to know the system I&#x27;m sending mails from - and also does not need to know which software version I&#x27;m running.<p>As it doesn&#x27;t have any impact on mail-delivery it would be a nice move from your side to protect user&#x27;s privacy a bit more as you already do.<p>Thx.",
