      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m based in the UK. I&#x27;m university-educated with a good, relevant degree. I make 24k&#x2F;year before tax. After tax that&#x27;s about 17.4k&#x2F;year. I don&#x27;t live in London or any major technology center.<p>I was hired fresh out of university at that salary and it&#x27;s stayed that way for one year. After the first six months, I had a perfomance review that indicated I need to improve my productivity, though my work was good.<p>Other than the technologies we use in-house, I have no experience with skills that are glamorous elsewhere. I don&#x27;t do web development, so I don&#x27;t know any React&#x2F;Vue, but I have a little (Github) experience with Postgres, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.<p>I&#x27;m aware that my salary is low - whether for when I started, or after one year of employment. The advancement opportunities are somewhat secret; all I know is that there&#x27;s a performance review at some point once or maybe twice a year.<p>To that end, it&#x27;s been hard to find jobs. Nobody wants someone who doesn&#x27;t have &quot;commercial experience&quot; with what they&#x27;re looking for, and most jobs seem to want two years minimum &quot;commercial experience&quot; to even apply. I&#x27;ve received nothing but rejections so far.<p>Ideally I&#x27;d like to transition to back-end web or fullstack, provided I&#x27;ll either be trained or I can do that in my free time with public projects before applying (i.e. &quot;commercial experience&quot; isn&#x27;t a hard requirement, only &quot;some experience&quot; is).<p>I feel stuck, because this job doesn&#x27;t seem to give me skills to further that kind of job, nor does it really give me skills (other than <i>language</i> skills - and that&#x27;s about three languages at maximum, not framework&#x2F;methodology&#x2F;technology skills which are sought after).<p>My main objective is a salary increase of anywhere above 20% (above inflation). Still, work here is laid back and I&#x27;m doing well.<p>To any software engineers in the UK (or anywhere), what would be the best course of action with only one year of experience and few marketable skills other than dabbling Github repos from four years ago?",
