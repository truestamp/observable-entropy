      "text": "I have some conflicting thoughts and emotions about the Holmes verdict.<p>I believe this case was pursued due to the flagrant disregard for the health (and thus safety) of Theranos clients. If it was &#x27;just&#x27; financial fraud against investors, I don&#x27;t believe the public would have been so angry, and the prosecutor so motivated.<p>However, Holmes was found not guilty on the charges related to blood tests. One of the jurors said they believed she was &#x27;one step removed&#x27;. The blood test charges were also not directly health related, they were fraud charges, as in the patient was defrauded into believing the tests were accurate.<p>The comment about being &#x27;one step removed&#x27; made me think of safety culture and how no executives at Boeing were prosecuted for the 737 MAX debacle (so far as I know).<p>Laws do not punish moral failings directly, no matter how big or flagrant. It is quite clear that Holmes failed to establish a safety culture that put accuracy of test results over profit or funding. But there is no law that directly addresses that particular failing, and it&#x27;s hard to see how American jurisprudence and society would frame or accept such a law.<p>So while I do see that Holmes was punished for her lies, and those lies were related to health and safety, I do find it hard to reconcile with the idea that health and safety are more important to maintain than legitimacy and fidelity of funding a startup.<p>What does the Elizabeth Holmes Verdict say about Rule of Law and Safety Culture?<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2UXicFk5q50 - Dropout Podcast on the verdict and juror point of view.",
