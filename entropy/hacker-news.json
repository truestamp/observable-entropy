      "text": "I’ve been seeing steadily more spam in my Gmail inbox for a long time now but the past couple weeks it has been on another level completely. At least 3 or 4 emails a day going to my inbox that follow the same pattern of gibberish subject line with a PDF attachment. I asked some coworkers and I don’t think it’s just me. Is there some subtlety to this situation or has Google just completely dropped the ball here? How are emails from strangers with PDF attachments not subject to a level of scrutiny that would catch this easily?",
