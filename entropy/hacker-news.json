      "text": "Hi folks,<p>I have recently been on a few Twitch streams as a guest and it seems like a totally different way to learn things. I was curious if you watched streams (on Twitch, youtube or elsewhere) and if so, what kind of technical topics you were interested in.<p>Also, any tips for great streams and&#x2F;or methods to learn better while watching (follow along, review later, etc)?<p>(I know lots of folks watch gaming on Twitch, but I&#x27;m more interested in it as a new way to learn about software development.)",
