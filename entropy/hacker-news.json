      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for advice om whether I should publish my research code? The paper itself is enough to reproduce all the results. However, the implementation can easily take two months of work to get it right.<p>In my field many scientists tend to not publish the code nor the data. They would mostly write a note that code and data are available upon request.<p>I can see the pros of publishing the code as it&#x27;s obviously better for open science and it makes the manuscript more solid and easier for anyone trying to replicate the work.<p>But on the other hand it&#x27;s substantially more work to clean and organize the code for publishing, it will increase the surface for nitpicking and criticism (e.g. coding style, etc). Besides, many scientists look at code as a competitive advantage so in this case publishing the code will be removing the competitive advantage.",
