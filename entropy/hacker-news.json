      "text": "I&#x27;m working as a data analyst&#x2F;scientist for two years and I&#x27;m already tired. In theory everything is amazing, the math, the algorithms, until u get a job. Useless and endless meetings, useless requests, arbitrary and weird decisions to make the boss and customers happy. We end working 40+ hours&#x2F;week but the job could be easily done in 30 or less, that is another thing that kills me inside. We all could be living our lives in those hours that we pretend we&#x27;re doing something. I know it sounds like I&#x27;m depressed and all that but I love life, my problem is with the state of things in the corporate environment, the faking and pretending that all is perfect in the way it is, and in the job but in the end everyone is unhappy and feeling like shit and waiting for friday. I just dont know what to do because it sounds to me that every company is the same. Does anyone else feels like that? What do you do to overcome this feeling?",

In the era of iOS 15, where Apple places more emphasis on privacy, why are users helpless with such super cookies?",
