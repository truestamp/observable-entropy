I am confusing myself (probably overthinking this) as to how exactly to keep track of hand progression at each table.<p>Any help&#x2F;direction would be greatly appreciated.<p>Cheers!<p>I did try researching this of course, but any search for &quot;poker database best practices&quot; only turns up countless poker tracking softwares.<p>And unfortunately not many private poker websites talk at length about their setups.",
