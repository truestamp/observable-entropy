      "text": "With companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, NVidia, and a slew of startups, all working on Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, I find it bizarre that Apple hasn&#x27;t taken this area more seriously. In the long term, it definitely could cost them.<p>Siri could benefit from LLMs, and given Apple&#x27;s customer base, an LLM-powered customer support could help them provide answers to questions quickly and only forward the tricky ones to human customer supports, saving cost and time for Apple.<p>When it comes to autocorrect, the situation with iOS is a joke compared to Android and even Windows. A better AI-powered autocorrect could put Apple on par with Google and Microsoft.<p>Some might say Apple is <i>secretly</i> doing all of this, but given the nature of such models, I find it difficult to believe that Apple wouldn&#x27;t open-source [part of] their model.<p>There&#x27;s just so much going on in AI and the hype around it is mostly exploited by Apple&#x27;s rivals, while Apple has been mostly silent and irrelevant.",
