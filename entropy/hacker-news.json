But having a look at youtube-dl&#x27;s repo, there&#x27;s more than 109k stars, which shows how popular the thing is. Even a DDG bug that would exclude youtube-dl from the search results received so much attention by HN.<p>Still though, I don&#x27;t understand why downloading from yt is so important nowadays. To be clear, I&#x27;m not asking whether it&#x27;s ethical or not. I&#x27;m asking <i>why</i> do people need to download stuff in the first place?",
