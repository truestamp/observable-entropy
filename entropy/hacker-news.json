      "text": "In ML there is a term: overfitting ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Overfitting )<p>There is currently a lot of booster talk and it seems it protects ~ 10 weeks.<p>I&#x27;m fully vaccinated ( Pfizer), if I plan to have the booster now then it&#x27;s reasonable to assume I will get one again after 2-3 months.<p>In that scenario:<p>- Vaccine ( = 2 x )<p>- Booster 1 ( January)<p>- Booster 2 ( March)<p>Then in March, the Omicron booster will be ready so it&#x27;s reasonable to assume I&#x27;ll receive one again in June. If Omicron protects ~3 months against reinfection and the peak of infection is end of January in Europe.<p>In the scenario that there becomes a Omicron variant that is more infective and more dangerous, it&#x27;s not unlikely that it will spread around March-April pretty fast. Before the next booster in June.<p>Could the human body have an overfitting problem because I was vaccinated too much against the current variant? This is in the scenario that I haven&#x27;t received a Omicron booster and there is no &quot;new variant booster&quot; available.<p>Or is this not how the body works?<p>I&#x27;m curious about any related resources or research based opinion to this hypothesis ( it is a hypothesis, there are many variables that could change it and that&#x27;s not what i want to discuss&#x2F;find answers to. ).<p>Note: I&#x27;m just wondering how the human body works and I don&#x27;t know where i can ask my question.
