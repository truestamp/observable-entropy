I&#x27;ve scoured the web but for the life of me couldn&#x27;t find anything substantial. Does anyone have links or anecdotes about TeamViewer they feel comfortable to share? \nPersonally, I&#x27;m of the opinion that these breaches happen due to human error, but I&#x27;d love to know more. \nThanks!",
