      "text": "Aside from the readings way back in school, I haven&#x27;t touched any fiction. I haven&#x27;t felt the need for it (I went into the sciences), and in general I just no longer have the patience to follow entire storylines (eg I also don&#x27;t watch any shows).<p>However, as I spend more time in social science and humanities spaces, I find myself running into literary references (especially the classics) more often that I would have expected, to the point where I&#x27;m now wondering how much am I missing out on if I don&#x27;t understand these references? How much am I missing out on if I&#x27;ve never read these classics, or just fiction in general?<p>Ironically, I feel that now as an adult I&#x27;d appreciate these a lot more than back then when it was required.<p>If I were to try reading fiction, especially the classics, where&#x2F;how should I start? Maybe some shorter titles that may help pique my interest in fiction? Any particular works that are must-reads, more so than the others?",
