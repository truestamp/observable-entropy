I do it by sampling digital indicators, rendering the data in useful ways, and injecting domain-specific insights. The UI interaction happens by foot pedal so my paradigm retains the traditional way of working with your hands.",

For a time maybe 15-20 years ago, maybe peaking around the era of Snowden it looked like technology was going to truly democratise the world.<p>Now we are being led into an orwellian hell hole.<p>For what tech produces it is overly rewarded economically. The true economic value of some companies like facebook or amazon may be negative.<p>What can we do or is it already too late to save the world from the big tech monster?<p>I think it is already too late. The internet is like an opiate or stimulant for the masses and a vampire, feeding off of and feeding into emotions and mass popular delusions allowing people to be manipulated as sheep and resulting in time and energy being wasted by literally billions.",
