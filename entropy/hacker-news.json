      "text": "This app was born out of my own needs. I prepared for Microsoft Azure certification, but usually, it was on the go. I wanted to find an app that will help me to prepare for exams via my smartphone, but I didn&#x27;t find what I need in 2020. Then I decided to develop it myself and it looks like I am not alone with such a problem. Currently, Learn Azure has 50,000+ downloads for iOS and Android together and good feedback from users.<p>The app is absolutely free and without ads. I&#x27;ve added donation option only when I decided to fully dedicate myself for Learn Azure project. More about this compelled decision is here - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnazure.app&#x2F;supportus\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnazure.app&#x2F;supportus</a><p>There are a lot of to tell about this project. Will be glad to do this in thread.",
