My intuition is leaning\ntoward using the standard trick of towers of types. Is it\npossible to show a system of arithmetic is consistent\nusing higher order types?<p>Which raises the question of self-modifying Turing machines.\nThis leads to the concept of a meta-Turing machine.<p>Not only must the &quot;instructions of the machine&quot; be &quot;on the tape&quot;\nso they can be modified but the &quot;structure of the hardware&quot;\nalso has to be &quot;on the tape&quot; so that changing the &quot;structure&quot;\nchanges the way the machine operates. A simple implementation\ncan be created in an FPGA which generates modifications to its\nown Verilog definition and reloads itself, becoming a fundamentally\ndifferent machine.",
