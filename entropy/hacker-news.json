      "text": "After looking at the recent front-page link about an HP product (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hpdevone.com), it hit me that Apple is quite possibly the only large website I visit without a cookie banner (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.com).<p>It&#x27;s delightfully refreshing to see an entire screen covered in website content, where step 1 isn&#x27;t to find a tiny &quot;x&quot; button on a popup.<p>It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t set cookies - they do. So what does Apple know&#x2F;do that everyone else doesn&#x27;t? And can I follow whatever they&#x27;re doing when building my own site?",
