      "text": "Trying submitting again. Previously shown here[0], Tamagui is now in beta.<p>Tamagui is the first UI kit for React that has an optimizing compiler - one that not only extracts styles at build-time, but even evaluates inline styles and inline logic like ternaries &#x2F; conditional spreads. It also flattens components (even those logic-containing ones) completely down to a div or View on Native when possible.<p>All of this leads to amazing performance gains[1], especially on the web and low-end mobile devices.<p>I think Tamagui is also really special outside of just the performance. It has an incredibly powerful theme system which you can truly change every aspect of every component through, it supports a `size` prop on every component that just works, and it has incredible first-class animation support.<p>Read more on the recent Beta blog post:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tamagui.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tamagui-enters-beta-themes-and-animations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tamagui.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tamagui-enters-beta-themes-and-anim...</a><p>---<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29321748\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29321748</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tamagui.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;benchmarks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tamagui.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intro&#x2F;benchmarks</a>",
