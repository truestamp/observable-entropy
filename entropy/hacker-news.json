I&#x27;m not even sure if when we get our customers if it will be fun then.<p>I will admit I&#x27;m not 100% into what I&#x27;m making but I got into this situation where I&#x27;m a founder in this thing&#x2F;have a partnership.<p>Still I just have so much work to do. It is hard to stay consistent.<p>I&#x27;m trying to find ways to keep me engaged. I&#x27;m doing stuff like small checklists so I feel good like I got things done. Another idea is to keep a status&#x2F;errors page to see things happening&#x2F;usage that might help me get more drive to make it good&#x2F;see the numbers.<p>The plus side is I have complete control of the tech and it has various domains that I can work in.<p>Anyway I have a few more months before something has to happen (we make money or I leave).<p>Edit: there is pay, but I make 40% of what I used to make so I&#x27;m sinking further into my existing debt.",
