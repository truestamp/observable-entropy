But for someone without the hind sight, looking into the future, what types of indicator would you look for? Also assuming that even if singularity is achieved (?) at some locations, the effects would take times to spread. Say it&#x27;s already reached at the opposite corner of the world. How long would it take for it to be apparent and what are some indicators? Also, happy thanksgiving.",

      "text": "When and why did we start splitting software engineering into front-end and back-end?<p>Was there a time when one could have been just a software engineer building websites or did the specialization was there since the beginning of HTML and CGI servers?<p>From Google Trends [1], it looks like maybe we started using this term in 2010.<p>My personal recollection: Around 2006 we had new projects like Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and JQuery which enabled additional complexity in HTML&#x2F;JS. In 2010, angular.js and backbone.js started and helped address a sentiment that JQuery was not good enough for large projects. It became hard for a software engineer to handle the new front-end frameworks while keeping up with the backend as well. So it would make sense to have the front-end engineer title introduced around this time. However, I don&#x27;t recall if there were discussions or blog posts explicitly introducing it.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=all&amp;q=front%20end%20engineer,back%20end%20engineer",
