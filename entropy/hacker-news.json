      "text": "The following article describes a sticky situation Nebraska is in (and therefore likely everyone in the world).<p>It explains how the Blackshirts of history have rooted themselves in geo-central Nebraska, how their weapon and final solution to the class problem is (GMO) corn.<p>The article links to articles around the rest of the internet and uses basic reasoning and visual literacy to make points.<p>However, this conspiracy is so powerful and menacing that this post will likely be flagged before it ever makes it to the front page.<p>It will be flagged by those for racism as well as those against it. It will be flagged by Germans and it will be flagged by the Jews, both racist and anti-racist.<p>So try to be wiser than that, just this one time for me, Hacker News, and reserve your judgment. Please approach this article without becoming overly critical and flagging it, because its important people hear about this.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewworldpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;05&#x2F;the-university-of-nebraska-supports-fascists-who-are-sterilizing-billions-of-people.html",
