We&#x27;re in the same market segment, but our software solutions differentiate themselves slightly differently.<p>The stakeholders are obviously interested in seeing an integrated software solution that provides the strengths of the two existing solutions in one service.<p>Obviously, there are technical challenges with this: the two existing solutions use extremely different tech stacks, where neither of which is appropriate for &quot;plugging in&quot; the other one. The technical people involved also want to take the opportunity to fix some long-standing scalability problems when it seems like they have to restructure the top-level architecture anyway.<p>But I&#x27;m more concerned with organisational problems. I feel like most of these integrations easily turn out wrong or inferior to either original service.<p>Do you have experience with this type of work? What did you learn? What would you suggest?",
