But life is short and it is not possible to commit to all of them and test my limits in each area, so I really need to do better and find a way to focus. I just don&#x27;t know how to do so. Anyone else been through this?",

I have some projects on my resume to talk about and I have no desire to study&#x2F;practice Leetcode&#x2F;DSA problems because I would rather learn a new skill, refine existing ones, or build something from a tutorial&#x2F;course&#x2F;idea. Not sure what to do since I know most new grad interviews focus on some copy pasted problems from Leetcode instead of talking about skills from previous projects, but I&#x27;d rather build something.",
