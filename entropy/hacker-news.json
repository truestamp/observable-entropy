I would think that junk mail filtering systems would have a rule that mail is never junk if it is from someone who I just sent a message to, and especially if the subject line is similar to that of my recent message.<p>Why does this ever happen? In case it matters, my mail is hosted by gmail, and I access it via Mail on my Mac. I don&#x27;t know whether gmail or Mac Mail is marking this stuff as spam, but both companies should know better!",

      "text": "My recent experience coding makes me wonder about the possibilities of including a well-researched depiction of the genesis of a certain technology in a work of literary fiction. Is there any programming language, hardware revolutions, or companies that you think could work as a central element of literary fiction? These technologies run our lives, but I find them stunningly difficult to depict. I have to wonder if I am simply looking in the wrong place. I wonder how Tolstoy would write about today’s world and the forces that drive it.",
