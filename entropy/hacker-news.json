      "text": "Hello HN crowd.\nI worked on this project on weekends and evenings. I&#x27;m excited I made it into a presentable MVP, and it is so satisfying.<p>I would like to get some honest feedback from this great community.<p>I made www.freeoptionscreener.com, to scratch a personal itch. I myself trade options as a hobby, and I didn&#x27;t find a screener that satisfies my need to be able to explore raw options data freely and without preset constraints. So I made this app that allows playing with options market data and extract interesting opportunities.<p>The techs used:\n- Laravel + Jquery + Mysql\n- Tradier API for market data \n- DigitalOcean for hosting\n- OVH for domain name<p>It costs me 5$&#x2F;month to run the website. I&#x27;ll be glade to continue if it proves to be a viable product in the long run and maybe I will take it to the next level and try monetize it.\nNote: the app is not suitable for phone screens yet, although this is a planned feature.",
