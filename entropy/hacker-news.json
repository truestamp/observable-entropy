      "text": "Dropshippping [1] is hugely popular and has flooded online marketplaces. For example, Amazon and eBay are filled with dropshipped listings. Even Etsy (&quot;handmade, craft, vintage&quot;) is swamped with dropshipped products.<p>Many product categories are now dominated by dropshipped products. We&#x27;ve all seen the same product photos listed under different &quot;brands&quot; by diffrent sellers with different prices - essentially the same product. Trudging through page after page of dropshipped products can be a chore.<p>I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone running a dropshipping business, but at the same time it does feel that many dropshipping sellers do not really care for the quality of the product they sell. If there is any product differentiation it rarely goes beyond sticking a logo on the product.<p>Is the picture of dropshipping above a fair one?<p>What are you thoughts on dropshipping as a customer? What are your thoughts if you are a dropshipper?<p>[1] Shopify explanation of dropshipping: <i>Dropshipping is an order fulfillment method where a store doesn’t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, the seller purchases inventory as needed from a third party—usually a wholesaler or manufacturer—to fulfill orders.</i>",
