The app seems to be discontinuedas there have been no updates since 2019, but still works fine. Could anyone help me? If needed, I can post some contact info of mine here, since I don&#x27;t even remember which e-mail I used (pretty sure it was my old spam gmail account)<p>source:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hidroh&#x2F;materialistic<p>screenshot of me signed in:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;ZlyIyqh.jpg",
