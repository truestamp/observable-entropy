      "text": "I received an email from Google Fi this week. Google claims that I have used too much international data roaming (I typically use around 1gb per month) and have not used the service in the US enough, according to the latest terms &amp; conditions update. I have read through the latest terms &amp; conditions, the acceptable use policy, etc. - and there is nothing specifically stated about this. So, if you are also a Google Fi subscriber and not in the US 100% of the time - be aware, and you may want to consider seeking alternatives soon.<p>Given how Google tends to kill products&#x2F;services on a whim, I guess I should have expected something like this at some point. For some reason, as a 5+ year paying customer, owner of multiple generations of Google(Pixel) phones, etc., I didn&#x27;t expect to be blocked with only a 30 day notice. The lack of transparency, proactive communication, and overall terrible customer experience is making me think hard about subscribing to anything from Google again after this.",

The aim is to bring a culture of collaboration to educational software by making a developer-friendly platform that can still be used by non-technical teachers.
