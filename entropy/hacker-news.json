      "text": "There&#x27;s more thinkpieces than you can count out there about why humans are incapable of interpreting risk, of the cognitive biases that inform our thinking, of the ways in which we underprepare for everything from asteroid impacts to stock market crashes.<p>What it comes down to is the fact that humans are emotional, intuitive creatures that like to do the kinds of things that FEEL right, even if they don&#x27;t bring the best outcome.<p>This makes sense, except for when you run up against the fact that we, as a society, have to figure things out for the whole as well as for the parts within it.<p>Does some of our thinking run aground because we can think about ourselves, but have no way of thinking about the whole, or the other way around?<p>From where I&#x27;m sitting, seems like the naive divison of dem&#x2F;repub is based on how we think about risk and what things we pay attention to losing, but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>All that to say - what is the weirdest thing about risk to you?",
