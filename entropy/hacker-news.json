      "text": "tl;dr: I made yet another background noise. It is helping me and people around me to concentrate better (tried with coding and reading books). Showing it here may be it is suitable for others too. Criticism is much appreciated or comment if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.<p>Problem: I felt claustrophobic when I listened to white noise (or any other color of noise). But sometimes I needed to block outside sound or the movement in the music I was listening to was simply distracting. I also like to listen to something that has some artistic value instead of mechanical randomness. So I made a piece of music to fulfill these needs, hence I am calling it pragmatic music. Something along how alarm buzzes was superseded by ringtones. They do have an artistic value but more importantly they serve a purpose.<p>Solution: I started with a brown noise (to mask distracting sounds, like human voice) and included some predictable alteration in volume, cut-off frequency, etc. to bring a sensation of passage of time. I then added 8 different Arias synthesized specially not to distract attention (avoid high pitches as our brain associates it with attention, added more consonances, subtlety regarding the noise, etc.). I also stretched them to trick the unconscious mind to believe there is no urgency needed while giving sensation of time.<p>Result: An hour long minimalistic track which I have uploaded to major music streaming stores called &quot;Serene Disquiet&quot;\non Spotify: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;open.spotify.com&#x2F;album&#x2F;4D8svNMd2Zpeq62ji39OiX",
