They may even attend a summit (eg in Minsk) or give promises (eg about expansion) but not really act on it later.<p>A = Ukraine\nB = Donbass<p>A = Russia\nB = Ukraine<p>A = USA and NATO\nB = Russia<p>PERPETUATION: The vast majority of regular people don’t want to take arms to fight over this stuff. But the politicians their country’s mass media and schools indoctrinate their population into supporting their concerns at one level while ignoring the concerns of others at other levels. “We are good, they are bad”<p>SOLUTION:<p>We have to start untangling this at the highest level first.
