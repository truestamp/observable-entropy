I realize functionality like that would be a large undertaking however if it were open-sourced and modular (so support can be added for whatever people want&#x2F;need), it seems doable. If there isn&#x27;t one, do you guys think there would be enough interest to start a project like that?\nWould be nice to have email (gmail, outlook, etc) alongside Discord, Telegram, stackexchange, github, etc in one place.",
