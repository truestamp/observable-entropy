      "text": "I am pretty extroverted and derive a lot of meaning and enjoyment from working with people IRL, not just across a Slack connection. My previous job went from tolerable to intolerable as a result of the pandemic caused 100% WFH. These days it&#x27;s hard to find an in office job, and even when you do, it feels like that would be s red flag anyway, since WFH is seen as a perk by most, or realistically I worry I&#x27;m going to go in to the office and be the only one there.<p>I just like being able to grab lunch with coworkers and shoot the shit. I find i care more about my work when I feel more connected to the other people who are affected by it.<p>(BTW I don&#x27;t mind partial WFH, thats just obviously beneficial for everyone.)<p>Are those days just over? Am I doing &#x2F; thinking about this wrong in some way? Is it not as bad as I think? Are there places out there for weirdos like me?",
