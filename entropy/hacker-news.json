I expect that number to rise and also I don&#x27;t expect to sell this year.<p>I have heard of ways to go about selling crypto without incurring capital gains tax. The most recent way was using a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7CMks9_PVqs<p>What are some other methods to avoid some (or all) of the capital gains tax and then possibly withdraw low (or no) taxes on the interest generated?<p>I&#x27;m in the Midwest, USA.",
