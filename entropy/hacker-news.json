      "text": "Hey folks!<p>My co-founder and I built a tool that lets you segment your Twitter audience. We parse your followers bios and then do some keyword analysis to determine interests, occupations, and other keywords. We also grab all of the available public metrics that Twitter&#x27;s API offers, like followers, follows, likes, etc...<p>If this sounds interesting, feel free to reach out on Twitter or just shoot us a note at email at wildfire.so, and I will give you an HN discount!<p>We&#x27;re curious what use cases this might support or what value people might gain from this. We have a hunch that the answer is basically zero. People like the data, but aren&#x27;t sure what else to do with it. In posting here, I was hoping folks of HN might have some ideas.<p>Let me know what you think!",
