I am a fluent Russian and Ukrainian speaker\nMy English is better than enough<p>The most recent mini-project that I needed to collect data for training NNs and other ml algos:<p>- Bypassed the requirement of having an XXX account by buying it on one of million Russian websites that sell hacked accounts freely (worth noting I bought empty auto-made accounts and not stolen)\n- Bypassed the requirement of having an XXX log-on by modifying and using an old library written in TS (worth noting it didn&#x27;t have the source, and I had to work with clusterfuck in js)\n- Bypassed form completion and puzzle captcha control using puppeteer\n- Bypassed captcha itself by training NN using fast.ai and deploying it*\n- Bypassed the requirement of phone number with matching by country IP address using 2 separated services \n- Packed everything together in less than 30 hours of focus time<p><i>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filipvitas.medium.com&#x2F;how-to-bypass-slider-captcha-with-js-and-puppeteer-cd5e28105e3c\n* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;zyoi&#x2F;ed5d351fb99b792c69a807223406ceb9<p>P.S. I don&#x27;t do evil things, I work with sites that never have APIs<p>P.S.S. Relevant old draft for ask hn that I didn&#x27;t post:<p>Where to report Twitter recommendation system abuse?<p>I made an account on Twitter in 2012, but barely ever used it.<p>A few months ago I installed the app to read English-talking data scientists.<p>I do not post or comment on anything. I only like some of the posts as save feature.<p>But since the installation of the app, the only notifications I get are recommendations about Russian-talking sex workers posting their nudes. Russian is the language I talk and my app is in it.<p>The most recent post confirmed my suspicions: they are paying to get recommended. The text says: «Some sluts again in your recommendations!».<p>I also was wondering if that&#x27;s just a self-perpetuating cycle where I get shocked by the content, visit it, and then it gets recommended even more. But ignoring or marking it as uninteresting does not work.<p>Honestly, I was thinking about how Russian-talking individuals, under the government and not, are abusing western platforms to their liking long before this incident.<p>I googled it, and the term that popped up is state-sponsored Internet propaganda. I have seen it times and times again going wild on western platforms with Russian content.<p>From my perspective, if western platforms want to protect users from the effects of such behavior, they need to hire people that are familiar with both abuse and the language it happening on.<p>Because at the moment it feels like the war they are not even trying to fight.</i>",

It means that the person can think of a problem critically, independent of any programming language and then design a solution. Then they can implement it in whatever language it needs to be implemented in. And does so efficiently. Ofcourse, to do this, they have to know the entire stack from the highest of high to the lowest of low abstraction levels of the machine.<p>Is this possible in practice? If so how? Any books?",
