      "text": "Hi HN, I am writing and maintain a open source python library for making network visualisations [1]. Since that is a fairly specialised task, the software typically only gets a couple dozen downloads a day on PIPy (the python package index). It is a labor of love, not my source of income, so that is totally fine by me.\nHowever, last weekend, there was a huge spike in downloads: instead of the 0-5 downloads that are typical for a normal weekend day, there were 2000 downloads, both on Saturday and Sunday [2]. I would love to know what happened here, or at least, I would like to be able to find out the next time something like this happens. Obviously, unlike a normal business, I don&#x27;t control the distribution, so I can&#x27;t measure the traffic with Google Analytics or similar tools.<p>I would love to hear how other people that have open source projects are getting their intel into their user base.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paulbrodersen&#x2F;netgraph<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pepy.tech&#x2F;project&#x2F;netgraph",
