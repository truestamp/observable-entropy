      "text": "I built https:&#x2F;&#x2F;veryla.io - a minimal website for Los Angeles.<p>After growing tired of the chaotic, fast paced, attention-economy focused state of the web, I decided to build something simple and quiet. A site with no &quot;real&quot; database (just a json file I update by hand), no email signups, no ads, no pop ups, no data collection (besides google analytics), and no comment section filled with highly polarized politics. A site updated only 1-2 times per week.<p>It&#x27;s just unique information in a simple and accessible format. The goal is for people to <i>not</i> check veryLA every day. I don&#x27;t want people hitting refresh for emotionally charged SEO packed news to react to. My goal is for people to check out veryLA 1-2 per week and then go into the real world and have fun with the information they found.<p>Hope you enjoy if you live in Los Angeles or are planning to visit!",
