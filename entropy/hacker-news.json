      "text": "I am looking at building a relatively small desktop app. It would handle confident information that I don&#x27;t want to have to handle for other people and storing it on the web might in fact deter some potential users. That&#x27;s why I want to build it as a desktop app rather than a web app which would be where I have the stronger skill set.<p>The app should be lightweight, since it won&#x27;t do that much (think fancy note taking for a few specific use cases), but ideally it also would be cross-platform. An Electron app would give me the cross-platform, but it&#x27;s definitely not lightweight and might even feel sluggish. I know everyone here loves to hate Electron. Right now I am inclined to just write it in Swift and make it only support the Apple ecosystem where it also would fulfill all my personal needs, but miss out on lots of potential monetization (which realistically will never happen if I look at my past side projects). Another option would be Qt which I used to write 20 years ago, but it seems very expensive.<p>What other options would you look at for building a desktop app in 2022?",
