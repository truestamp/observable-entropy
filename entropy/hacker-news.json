The link is about the possibility of adding  JSON specific command line options in curl. There are a lot of interesting comments and the submission quickly raised to the top HN rank. A few hours latter, the title of the submission has been changed and the submission is now below rank 50 or lower.<p>I&#x27;m ingeniously curious about it. It seems to me that this kind of submission stays longer in the HN high ranks. Does the HN also detects something about it?",
