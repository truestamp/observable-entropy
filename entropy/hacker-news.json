It works now but I still don&#x27;t fully understand why it works.<p>This is not uncommon in devops and test, but happened to me more than once in embedded code and even in other places. Sometimes I spend some official or private time investigating it, sometimes I put it into a backlog and in some cases I don&#x27;t even bother due to lack of time.<p>How much time, if any, do you spend investigating something that is already working? Will you loose sleep over it?",
