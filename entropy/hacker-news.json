      "text": "We created FedScale, which has a diverse set of challenging and realistic benchmark datasets to facilitate scalable, comprehensive, and reproducible federated learning (FL) research. FedScale datasets are large-scale, encompassing a diverse range of important FL tasks, such as image classification, object detection, word prediction, and speech recognition. Our evaluation platform provides flexible APIs to implement new FL algorithms and includes new execution backends with minimal developer efforts. Check it out, and feel free to join the FedScale community via Slack(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.slack.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;fedscale&#x2F;shared_invite&#x2F;zt-uzouv5wh-ON8ONCGIzwjXwMYDC2fiKw)!<p>Paper: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2105.11367 and Github repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;symbioticlab&#x2F;fedscale<p>Cheers!",
