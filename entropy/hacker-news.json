      "text": "Hey! This is a reader mode browser extension I built that hides noisy page elements rather than extracting and re-rendering their text content. The idea is to not make all articles look the same [0], have them still render graphs, and ideally to work in more cases.<p>There are a few &quot;tricks&quot;: patching the site CSSOM to apply simpler mobile styles even at desktop width, cleaning up parents of DOM text nodes, blocklists for class names that contain words like &quot;sidebar&quot;, plus manual CSS patches for popular sites.<p>I got carried away and also added a dark mode, page outlines, privates notes &amp; inline Hacker News comments. [1] \nThe last feature works by parsing every top-level HN comment with a quote in it (formatted with &gt; or &quot;&quot;) within a few minutes, and anchoring these quotes in the story article HTML. So when you open a link you&#x27;ll directly see the parts people are talking about here. [2]<p>The extension code is all on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindylearn&#x2F;unclutter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindylearn&#x2F;unclutter</a><p>---<p>[0] Unclutter vs the Firefox reader mode: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindylearn&#x2F;unclutter&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;comparison.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lindylearn&#x2F;unclutter&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;compa...</a><p>[1] The linked website show some examples for these.<p>[2] It&#x27;s also fun to try this on some of the &quot;HN classics&quot; that got 30+ quote comments over the years.

      "text": "What services and best practices would you advise for centrally managing multiple emails over multiple domains ? These would include a personal email domain and several business &#x2F; side project domains. Each domain would obviously need several adresses.<p>From what I’ve seen Gmail and Office 360 don’t seem quite suited to this scenario, since you tend to have to spread things out over several paid accounts.<p>Obviously, good deliverability would be a strong requirement as well as ease of use. Some interesting features to have might be the ability to merge or keep separate inboxes depending on their intended use and offer private inboxes to employees.<p>If anyone has any experience in doing this or any services to recommend, it would be much appreciated !
