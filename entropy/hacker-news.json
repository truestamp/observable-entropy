Where do I find people to work with me? How to others here do this? How do you start a project you know it&#x27;s bigger than just you?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been pretty skeptical until I had a recent epiphany brought on by a16z&#x27;s enthusiasm for the market.<p>There have been rising standards of living around the world so that many people can afford a smart phone that connects to the internet. Many of these people are unsophisticated internet users. Add to that large number the large number of younger teens in the Western world who can now have smart phones and always on internet access. This is a huge number of people who are susceptible to clever marketing about web3 being the next version of the web, so they better get in on it.<p>Why should I care if the teenage son of a wealthy banker in Switzerland wants to blow his Dad&#x27;s money speculating on NFT&#x27;s? How about the sons and daughter of wealthy Arabs in the oil countries? Surely it doesn&#x27;t matter if I, as a member of the Silicon Valley elite, take them for a ride and teach them a valuable lesson while profiting handsomely?<p>I&#x27;m searching for my moral compass, but I&#x27;m kind of losing my interest in finding it as I think about all the money to be made from the great numbers of wealthy kids who won&#x27;t be made homeless by the tricks of Silcon Valley. I&#x27;d be doing my part to balance out wealth inequality, so I&#x27;d actually be performing a useful service for society.",
