      "text": "Hey everyone.<p>Lot of talk about how the market is super hot right now for programmers with experience, was hoping we could share numbers and experiences with each other to get an accurate view of things, whether it&#x27;s worth putting in the effort to find another job (for me, relearning algorithms).<p>So I make 145k a year, no equity, I&#x27;m the only developer in a small company that has has a software product. Live in a tax-free state in the US, not micromanaged, can take off for a couple hours in the day if I want to. Probably do 30 hours of dedicated work a week. Have ~7 years of experience, manage everything, backend, frontend, servers, etc.",
