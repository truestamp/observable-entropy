      "text": "I suspect this idea has already appeared quite a bit on HN already, but I&#x27;d quite like to train a language model to detect language intended to persuade. The model would then be exposed via an API so that I could build a browser extension which would examine social media posts and mark them accordingly.<p>Quite apart from the expense I&#x27;ll incur training this model, I&#x27;m struggling to figure out a way of finding enough definitive propaganda to begin with given that it&#x27;s such a subjective topic. Ideally I&#x27;d use a wide variety of propaganda types such as advertising, political propaganda, social media comments plugging a given product or service, and other categories of propaganda. Is anybody here on HN aware of any collections of propaganda I can easily ingest in a machine-readable form or failing that, have any ideas of how I could go about constructing one myself?<p>This is purely a personal project with no desire for monetisation, I&#x27;m just curious to know how much of my browsing does actually consist of propaganda given it&#x27;s such a topic of discussion at the moment.",
