      "text": "School sports are important but inherently sexist. I propose some sports, e.g., basketball, ultimate, soccer, be played by women for one quarter, then the men, and so on, until the game is over. It&#x27;s a small step but unites the whole school behind each game. The order is unimportant (the team winning the coin toss could decide which group to field first) but the idea, the equal value of all to the outcome, is far fairer than the status quo.",
