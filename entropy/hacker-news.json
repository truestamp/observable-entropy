I have tried all the previously used devices to reset the password from. It still keeps sending the code to the same email.<p>It&#x27;s an account I use for AdSense and I have unpaid revenue in there. I have literally tried 5 different devices that I have used the account on, I can verify the phone number but then it keeps asking me to verify a code that&#x27;s sent on the same email.<p>Now that I&#x27;m trying potential passwords, it asks me to solve a captcha everytime and I&#x27;ve tried so many times that it says I&#x27;ve entered the captcha wrong even though it&#x27;s correct.
