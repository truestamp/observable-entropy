      "text": "I&#x27;ve never felt like I&#x27;m good at being creative, coming up with original ideas, my own unique independent thoughts. Even though I have spent years practicing &quot;creative&quot; skills - traditional and digital art, writing, gamedev, programming. I&#x27;ve made a lot of things, I&#x27;m pretty proud of some of my projects.<p>But &quot;creativity&quot; still feels like a mystery to me. I&#x27;ve had a few good ideas over the years, but they happened by accident, and I can&#x27;t make them happen deliberately. Sometimes I can go months without an original thought. If I want to intentionally invent a new idea for an app, or a game, or a story, or a business - I feel like I can&#x27;t, no matter how hard I try.<p>And generally speaking, in life, I feel like I&#x27;m pretty bad at having my own unique take&#x2F;opinion on things, even though I&#x27;m trying. Most of my &quot;controversial&quot; thoughts and opinions came from the controversial&#x2F;unpopular books&#x2F;essays&#x2F;posts I have read.<p>How do people like Scott Alexander, Paul Graham, Eliezer Yudkowsky, etc, just think of all these unique and original things? It seems like they just have a boundless source of insightful ideas. How can I get better at this?",
