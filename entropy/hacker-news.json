      "text": "I read that a lot of people here take privacy online very seriously. I think of privacy as a trade-off between privacy and convenience. Sure I could install an ungoogled android and only download apks from a alternative AppStore or I could just use Google Play and avoid a lot of effort. The price is my privacy. I understand that but if it comes to it convenience always triumphs over privacy. I don&#x27;t understand why I should care if some mutltibillion dollar company knows where I go and what I buy.<p>Is there something I am missing? As I understand it the battle for privacy is long lost because most people, like me, just don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s tremendous effort to fight against it. Even if you do manage to stay &quot;off the grid&quot; what&#x27;s the upsite?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using MATE+Compiz on Archlinux since 2015 because I was used to it and it had a lot of GUI features that I didn&#x27;t find elsewhere. At around the same time, I did give Gnome 3 a spin and found a lot of clunky behavior and bugs. Fast forward to yesterday when I was considering buying a new laptop to replace my ThinkPad x250 which is starting to show its age, I thought I give Gnome on Wayland another try.<p>OMG! It is nothing like I remember it. To put it succinctly, it&#x27;s MacOS interface for linux. It&#x27;s smooth, performant, beautiful and functional. I can do everything I used to have on Compiz, here on Gnome and it&#x27;s built-in. I haven&#x27;t actually needed any Gnome Extensions so far.<p>Well done Wayland, Gnome, GTK and every other project involved in making what&#x27;s essentially the best Linux Desktop experience I&#x27;ve ever had.<p>As for getting a new laptop, that idea went out the window fast. My machine feels like new and I can attest to a significant performance boost of GUI apps as the result of switching to Gnome.",
