      "text": "A few others commented on a recent thread [0] mentioning that they no longer browse the the internet, and that the internet &quot;forgot how to let itself become browsed&quot;.<p>This really got me thinking about this whole phenomenon. Of proliferation of &quot;walled-gardens&quot;, of search engines like Chrome becoming less effective due to SEO optimization and thus users having to look elsewhere, whether that&#x27;s Reddit, Quora, HN, etc.<p>Obviously, we all still occasionally browse the web, but it really doesn&#x27;t compare to back in the days, at least for me.<p>What&#x27;s happened to the web??? How much is because of shifts in technology, and how much is because of a <i>cultural</i> shift, of how we use the web, of the type of information we seek (eg preferring people-mediated information like Reddit&#x2F;Quora&#x2F;HN, rather than static information sources like a website dedicated to a topic)?<p>Maybe this isn&#x27;t necessary bad thing? Or is it? If we could dream up a different search environment and different technologies surrounding the internet and the WWW, what would it be?<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31111394#31114748",
