      "text": "Hi HN,<p>In the past I&#x27;ve made many HTML5 web games as a freelancer, before becoming a fulltime full stack engineer. Luckily, at my current job I was given the freedom to make a wordle clone with the ability to create your own custom words.<p>The game is coded in TypeScript with PixiJS and Greensock for the tweens. It also has a simple AWS backend to store the user created words and map shortened urls to them. The graphics were done by a graphics artist from the same company I work for.<p>You can play the game here - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;words.gg&#x2F;nNkbh<p>In order to create a custom word, click on the bulb icon in your upper right corner. You can also try a non-dictionary word. After that, you can share the custom word link with your friends.<p>Please let me know what you think and I&#x27;ll be happy to answer any questions you have.",
