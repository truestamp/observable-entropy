      "text": "I learned about UML in a course, but have never used it or seen it in practice as a junior developer. Sometimes I&#x27;ll see a flowchart, but that&#x27;s not too common. Is this the same in other companies?<p>With some of our code, the designers are either gone or sometimes unavailable, and it can be tricky to see how all the pieces fit together. A good IDE makes the job a little easier (finding references, ctrl+click to go to declarations, etc.), but it&#x27;d be nice to have a diagram or something for visualization.<p>So, is it a good idea to try documenting the code design through some sort of visualization? If so, using UML or something else? I suppose there might be tools for doing this automatically in some languages? Otherwise I think if it was valuable enough, it could be something we make sure to review and update along with code changes.<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated!",
