      "text": "per wikipedia: &quot;Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) is a diagnostic communication protocol used in electronic control units (ECUs) within automotive electronics.&quot;  If you have a car&#x2F;truck&#x2F;motorcycle&#x2F;boat&#x2F;tractor&#x2F;etc produced in the last few decades it likely has one or more ECUs that use this protocol.<p>What is the point of UDS?\nTo make ECUs faster to develop and more testable by specifying a standard set of primitives for remote procedure call (RPC).<p>Why did you make this?\nBecause it saves time at work.<p>Why did you publish this?\nBecause I can. Because I couldn&#x27;t find another free implementation. To get us to the singularity a few seconds sooner by reducing duplicated work. To attract commentary from domain experts that might erode my ignorance.",
