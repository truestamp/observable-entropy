      "text": "Yeah yeah, another todo app . But not really.<p>KissTodo spawned from my dislike of the currently available task management tools. It combines focus and simplicity to offer an improved experience over the other solutions on the market.<p>Most developers try to create a todo app as their first app and as such does not come from a real need and provides no real value.<p>I was truly disenchanted with the current task management apps out there and I am truly satisfied with KissTodo (been using it for close to 6 months).<p>I don&#x27;t know if KissTodo is for you or not, but I believe it can bring value to those that like flexibility, simplicity, minimalism and nimbleness.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m ready to get roasted<p>I welcome any comment, discussion, suggestion or insult haha<p>Cheers!!<p>(My apologies for reposting, I really wanted to do a proper &quot;Show HN&quot; and also post with a working link )",
