      "text": "A client reached out to me after seeing my online portfolio and wants me to build him a backend for a product he&#x27;s developing for his personal business. I&#x27;m less concerned with the technical requirements (I know I can handle those!) but am fairly clueless when it comes to pricing, a contract etc. I have an initial meeting coming up and want to appear as informed and professional as possible.<p>1. How do you decide how much to charge once you&#x27;ve determined all of the requirements for a given project? I&#x27;m staying away from hourly billing.<p>2. Does anyone have a good contract template they can provide for project-based billing? Is this worth pursuing on LegalZoom? Is there a boilerplate solution already floating around out there that you would recommend?<p>3. Is a ballpark price during the initial meeting something to stay away from? I don&#x27;t want to pull a number out of thin air based on an on-the-fly assessment.",
