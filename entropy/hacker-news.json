      "text": "I have found it hard to really kick off my career in Web3.<p>I&#x27;m a dev with some free-time experience from Web3. I have studied the basic concepts myself and built some small dApps for fun, but I have never properly worked in the field.<p>My plan has been to first test Web3 as a freelance contributor in DAOs before looking for a permanent career shift. However, I have struggled to find my place in these orgs. You participate in discussions, vote in proposals, and still might miss a project if you&#x27;re not online at the right time (happens often to me since I&#x27;m from Europe...).<p>Certainly another opportunity would be to look directly for full-time crypto opportunities. Yet, I would feel much more comfortable to start out with freelancing – most projects seem to (understandably) prefer devs with some more experience, and I&#x27;d like to be sure I&#x27;m capable of delivering value from the get-go.<p>In my opinion, there has been two main problems in getting started with DAOs:<p>- Finding organizations: Where do you find these orgs today? Should I just somehow find my way to the correct Discord servers, or what&#x27;s the process? Certainly everyone knows the biggest few, but I&#x27;d like to ensure I stay on track of the latest project launches and the most exciting new opportunities.\n- Finding work: While &quot;traditional&quot; organizations often promote their opportunities in some job sites or on platforms like LinkedIn, I haven&#x27;t found any similar sources for DAO projects. Again, being in Discords seems to be the best option – but it just feels so inefficient!<p>To solve this, my co-founder and I founded Kleoverse (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kleoverse.com&#x2F;). We gather together all DAOs and open Web3 working opportunities, so that it&#x27;s frictionless for you as a developer to find the most suitable projects and organizations to start working with. Kleoverse is the single source for all open Web3 projects – just log in and start contributing to those that look exciting!<p>Soon, we&#x27;ll help you to build your Web3-native professional identity so that you can verifiably prove your talent. Makes it even easier to find work in Web3 and DAOs :)<p>If you find this interesting, ensure your early access by signing up today",
