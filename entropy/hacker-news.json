      "text": "I&#x27;m a founder at a stealth startup building a novel software for a specific industry, which in our tests have shown to be able to reduce costs for a specific budget anywhere between 20 and 35% for the client, which are very big private organizations, per annum. We&#x27;re about to go to the market for the first time after the tests, but we have been thinking about the best way to price for the annual billing.<p>Our line of reasoning right now is: if our tech will allow our clients to spend let&#x27;s say 1M&#x2F;y less than before, it would be perfectly fine for us to charge somewhere between 25-35% of the benefit (250k-350k&#x2F;y). Is this valid, in yours opinion?<p>We don&#x27;t have good estimates for what our real cost of service will be, but we&#x27;re sure we can make it work if we charged 25-35% of the benefit.<p>I think I should mention the cost for our client to adopt our technology is very very low compared to the benefit, so it&#x27;s not much of relevance in pricing.<p>Any ideas or resources for reading would be much appreciated. I&#x27;m sorry for not being able to tell all the relevant info, but I&#x27;m happy do discuss and answer questions.<p>Thank you!<p>PS: English is not my primary language.",
