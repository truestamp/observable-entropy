I began noticing I received more upvotes and engagement when I pandered to views or opinions that are either the direct opposite of what the original content suggests (through cherry-picked exceptions), or I&#x27;ll find a tangentially related view that&#x27;s either current and popular, or supports a topic or viewpoint I&#x27;d like to know more about - often pandered with some popular topic.<p>Often this results in a thread about stuff that I actually want to read about, or someone <i>actually</i> knowledgeable on the subject will correct me - and call me out, but will receive far less approval (and often be flamed for criticizing me). On the plus side, I get to learn from someone really knowledgeable about how something works! (EDIT: Later I&#x27;ll often go back and reply to the person saying they are correct, I was wrong - and thank them for their reply.)<p>Here&#x27;s one of the worst examples (which I regret) because it perpetuates a view about a place I&#x27;ve never been, I&#x27;ve never stepped foot in the continent of Africa - it&#x27;s one of the few times I wish I could go back and &quot;correct the record&quot;: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9309170<p>I know nothing about IP law - &gt;200+ upvotes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27035901<p>I know nothing about, and have never been through Australia&#x27;s ACCC courts - almost 200 upvotes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26787289<p>I&#x27;ve never hosted any copyrighted media, ever: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;context?id=16955522<p>I know nothing about tax havens, I&#x27;ve never even submitted my own taxes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;context?id=16809428<p>Does anyone else do this?",
