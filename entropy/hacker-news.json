I simply Google around with whatever feel relevant only to realise, months later, that there is a much better field-specific term or some vague jargon&#x2F;synonym of what I was supposed to be searching for.<p>I assume this should be a somewhat elementary issue to vet startups and do competitor analysis.<p>How do you do that?<p>Also, what measures do you use to figure out the strength of the competing solutions?",
