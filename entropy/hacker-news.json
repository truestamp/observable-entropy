      "text": "I am really struggling making a decision to get the new Macbook Pro 14, I had even ordered one already with 32GB and 1TB, looked a long time at that 3200€ before clicking the button and just cancelled the order again. I was wondering if others have the same thoughts.<p>Short background: I use my laptop 95% for development, mostly web, including docker. My current Macbook Pro 15 2011 died two years ago and I resurrected it with Ubuntu. The reason it died was probably Docker, it was running at 105% every day for multiple months, and performance was still very bad. After switching to Ubuntu I could not believe how snappy everything was again, not only Docker.<p>With Macbooks before M1 it would have been easier, because you could run everything plus you had the best OS, but those have other problems (Keyboard etc). Now I somehow cannot justify spending so much for being completely closed in the Apple system and getting worse performance doing dev stuff.<p>I think the M1 is superior when it comes to video, graphics etc. what seems to be the core target group of buyers for Apple. But for development I think the best times are over. Working as a freelance dev on my last jobs actually most were running Linux.<p>Only problem is getting a setup that runs with current hardware, and then I just found out that you can actually order a Lenovo X1 Carbon with Ubuntu preinstalled, it just has a long wait time (&gt; 6 weeks).<p>What probably annoyed me most with the new Macbooks, is that not only is everything soldered, but they take 460€ tops for getting 32GB Ram - even by Apple standards this is ridiculous. For Lenovo it was 50Euro to get 32GB :))<p>So what do you think? Is anyone getting a M1 Pro for doing dev stuff? Or maybe using a normal M1, maybe even a Macbook Air and using it with Docker (Postgres, Redis etc)? That would be another option I am thinking about...<p>Curious on your opinion and experiences!",
