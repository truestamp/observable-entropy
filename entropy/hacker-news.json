      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using tools like Ledger, Org-mode, Groff and TeX for many years and feel like they&#x27;re much more efficient and provide an overall better experience than popular WYSIWYG software. The only case WYSIWYG feels better to me is in the initial minutes or hours of usage&#x2F;learning, afterwards it&#x27;s so much more flexible and easier to get the exact output I want.<p>But there are professions in which these tools play a much bigger role than mine, and I see these people using Microsoft Office everywhere, often barely able to open plaintext files. I really want to understand why. Am I missing some advanced Office features? Is it just lack of experience on my part? Does my experience with programming languages or Emacs play a large role? Is Microsoft&#x27;s influence and lock-in too strong?",
