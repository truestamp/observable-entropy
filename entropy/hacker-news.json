      "text": "I have heard and experienced that open-source projects have an edge in development speed. Is it the case for you as well? For Jina(an open-source Neural Search framework), it took 1 year to move from v0 to v1; 3 months to move from v1 to v2; and 6 months to move from v2 to v3. And this seems quite impressive to me, given that my other closed-source projects had long development cycle. We have had 205 contributors. Looking forward to hear your experience, do you also feel open-source increased the development speed?",

      "text": "I&#x27;m curious where the HN community has found luck finding freelancers for mobile app dev.<p>I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m just not going to have enough time to learn how to build for both android and iOS and handle the release cycles for both. I need to find a mobile developer that can build the MVPs so that I, and others, can iterate on them from there. I can find a mobile app developer to knock out MVPs on iOS and Android in a way such that the apps are well documented, tested, and maintainable after they leave the project.<p>My website was built from scratch using Django and Postgres. It is up and running with Stripe integration (proud of that) so the website provides a working Beta to build off of. The web app that I&#x27;ve built is not complicated -- think something like a TODO app -- but I imagine integrating with the website&#x27;s existing Postgres database will be tricky. Further, I&#x27;ll require the mobile app developer be skilled in prompts and notifications for their platform of expertise as well as in managing accessibility features.<p>Any thoughts on the above places for finding a good mobile app dev, either for iOS, Android, or both?<p>Tentatively I&#x27;m willing to spend $5k to $10k on a contract basis to get this done right.<p>A couple of areas I&#x27;ve thought of finding mobile app devs:<p>* Direct messages for referrals on LinkedIn (no luck just yet)<p>* &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring&quot; on HN (haven&#x27;t posted yet, not sure if consulting is appropriate for this thread)<p>* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codementor.io&#x2F; (hit and miss)<p>* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lever.co&#x2F; (seems like overkill for what I&#x27;m after)<p>* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.devteam.space (Had a less than great experience with customer service but thinking of going back)<p>Please let me know! Thanks.",
