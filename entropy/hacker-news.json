People sitting atop thousands of pounds of jet fuel which is burned at incredible force.<p>There must be so much that can go wrong but perhaps some of the fundamentals are being solved by SpaceX (and others) to the point that some of the previously scary stuff is more so part of a boring checklist?<p>I know there’s a few rocket scientists around here :)",
