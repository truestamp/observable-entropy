I wanted to turn over a new leaf, a fresh start.<p>But now I still have a few weeks to resist the urge to log back in, ugh.<p>I&#x27;ve emailed a bunch of support teams, here is the last reply I got from a company.<p>&gt; Thanks for reaching out to the Community Support Team. To maintain the integrity of our process, there is a 30-day period before the account is permanently deleted. Unfortunately, we are unable to fulfill your request. If our policy changes, we&#x27;ll let you know right away.<p>Integrity.",
