      "text": "A while back my wife called their main customer service number and got a gift card scamming operation.  On their site they have this number 1 833-888-0776 listed for online customer service https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;56WctZu.  If you call it you either get the normal TJ Maxx welcome message and number tree but sometimes you hear a message like &quot;please wait because the number may have changed&quot; and then either a message about a gift card or press 1 for English and then it forwards to a credit scam call center.  I called some of their technical staff last night and this morning but it is still happening as of me writing this post so I figure I need to post it publicly as well to get some publicity since this is really not ok.<p>It seems probable that someone managed to put a number in the load balancing of their system and is shunting off a subset of calls out to another call center.",
