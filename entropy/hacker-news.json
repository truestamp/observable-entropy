      "text": "Hi HN aficionados,<p>I was wondering if anyone has a good system for keeping track of replies to comments you posted on HN. As far as I am aware, HN doesn’t offer any type of notification mechanism that would include notifications for replies to your comment (it would also be nice to be able to subscribe to all comments for certain posts). The lack of a notification mechanism means you need to manually monitor your comments page and see if there were replies. I was curious if anyone has a good solution to this.",
