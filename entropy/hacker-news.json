      "text": "It used to be everyone had their own phpBB or vBulletin forum for discussion on niche topics and it was a sort of proto-social-media where you had the ability to &#x27;like&#x27; or &#x27;star&#x27; posts, build up friends and followers, etc. All tools which are now the staple of social media.<p>But lately I&#x27;ve noticed a lack of these forums in search results. It used to be in the good ol&#x27; days you would search for a topic and some forum would discuss it at length, with hundreds of comments, and then the topic got locked as the issue was resolved.<p>I still see forums in search results, but they&#x27;re mostly old-timer forums which have sufficient funding and a credible userbase, and are staying regardless.<p>Did social media absorb these forums? Did messenger apps absorb them? Did Discord absorb them? Did Reddit absorb them?<p>Where&#x27;s have all the forums gone?",
