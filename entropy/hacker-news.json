      "text": "Hey HN, I find that I always have a long list of books to read, and to be honest I can only read one book at a time, and it takes me a week or two to read it. For this list I compile self-help, learning, entrepreneurship kind of books, not the fiction entertainment kind of book. Fiction I can consume much quicker. A good self-help book usually means actionable, concrete guidance with just a sprinkle of theory.<p>The reviews from Goodreads or Amazon are inconsistent and often just false, and I&#x27;ve found the only reliable source of good books are my friends (and only a handful of them).<p>What system are you currently using to narrow that book list down and find the truly helpful reads?",
