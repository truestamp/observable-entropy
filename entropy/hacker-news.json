      "text": "Hi, I am currently at the end of third year at my university. I need to do a research in my fourth year to complete my degree.\nMy lecturers recommended doing a software engineering related research. We don&#x27;t need to develop a product but a conclusion is enough.\nI am passionate about web development. Can you give me some ideas. I really want to put some effort into this research. Please point me some worthy areas to consider.(anything old but overlooked is fine tho)\nThank you.",
