      "text": "Teams I&#x27;ve worked with often have a few scripts that are needed by other non-technical teams or team members. These scripts do things like make a couple of API calls to our backend, or run a SQL query, or generate a monthly report. Typically, we tell these folks to make the calls from Postman. If we&#x27;re really nice, there might be a Jenkins job they can input a few params into and run (we usually want to keep it simple and avoid building UI&#x27;s).<p>Has anyone else run into this problem? It feels weird giving non-technical team members this much access and I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s any better solutions out there.",
