      "text": "I&#x27;ve had exposure to various UI libraries ranging from plain Win32, MFC, WindowsForms, Swing, wxWidgets and Qt.<p>But the DX and design of Flutter library amazes me, the flexibility and possibilities are endless with the &quot;everything is a widget&quot; paradigm and I have not seen anything like that before. The data classes (describing padding, margins, box decorations, border radius etc) among many other idioms once learned, feel very natural.<p>IMHO Flutter might have its problems NOW but I don&#x27;t see it going away unless Google itself pulls the plug. There&#x27;s nothing like that in the space especially if you&#x27;re looking for custom look and feel.<p>Few questions:<p>Surely, it drew some inspirations from React which is a great idea in itself but what other influences are on the Flutter&#x27;s UI SDK&#x2F;class&#x2F;architecture?<p>Are such things designed by a committee or a single architect or a small closely knitted group?<p>Would appreciate if there&#x27;s some history as well.",
