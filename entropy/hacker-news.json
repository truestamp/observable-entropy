      "text": "Why are we even paying for Slack?<p>Mar 29, 2022, 10:37 AM PDT<p>Dear support\nwe do have an employee in Ukraine: Dmytro\nhe can’t access his slack account anymore.\nDmytro is living in Ukraine close to the border with Russia in Bakhamut (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;6ub2BqXW64eS1ApA9) Ukraine.\nDmytro is a Ukrainian citizen who is living in Ukraine. We would love Dmytro to have access to slack again without VPN or similar.\nCan you please assist us?\nBest<p>-----<p>Paul (Slack)<p>Mar 30, 2022, 7:17 AM PDT<p>Hello Daniel,<p>Paul here from Slack. Thanks for your writing in with your question, although I&#x27;m sorry for the trouble your colleague is having connecting to Slack. Can you please have this person reach out to us here directly at feedback@slack.com so we can investigate on their behalf?<p>We&#x27;ll be standing by for their outreach.<p>Warmly,\nPaul<p>-----<p>Hello Paul,<p>I would like to continue the correspondence started by my management and clarify the point.<p>As Daniel mentioned in his previous letter, I am located in a town that is officially under the control of the Ukrainian government and has not been occupied by Russian military forces. Feel free to check the location via this link (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;6ub2BqXW64eS1ApA9). My IP address is 176.121.230.29 to make it even more precise.<p>I consider it to be genuinely unfair that Slack limited my access to the software considering my town to be a part of Russia or any other restricted area. This fact is offensive to me as a citizen of Ukraine and a part of the resistance to the Russian invasion.<p>I hope this issue can be resolved soon.<p>Best regards,\nDmytro<p>----<p>Paul (Slack)<p>Mar 30, 2022, 2:26 PM PDT<p>Hello Dmytro,<p>Thanks for letting us know. We&#x27;ll review the information we have and will get back to you soon.<p>Warmly,\nPaul",

      "text": "The company I work for has a system that defines and manages &quot;roles&quot;, &quot;teams&quot;, &quot;operations&quot; etc. to enforce best security practice (minimal privilege principal for example). It works by mandating some sensitive operation (for example ssh to our production environment machines to investigate issues) to require an &quot;approval&quot; from manager to explicitly allow the operation to proceed. And there&#x27;s also an &quot;elevation&quot; mechanism that will give your current account privileged role for only a few hours (to elevate, approval is required as well).<p>The thing is, that&#x27;s a very internal system tightly depending on network environment (e.g., only on-prem machines understands the lockbox request). Recently I&#x27;m working on a project that is purely cloud-based and have no access to such tool&#x2F;service, yet I wanna add the &quot;approval&quot; and &quot;elevation&quot; mechanism to my project to ensure some security practices are maintained. I searched on github and no luck.<p>My questions are:<p>1. Is there any similar framework that does the job without needing me to implement the whole thing?<p>2. If I want to create a open-source project to do this, is it going to &quot;end up okay&quot; or has any value? I mean there&#x27;s probably to tons of questions and problem to think about.",
