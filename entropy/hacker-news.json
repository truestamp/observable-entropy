      "text": "Hello. I am the owner, of a tech startup with almost 30 people on board. I spend 80% of my time on programming (nothing fancy, cruds etc.) and 20% on the rest of the stuff (managing, hiring). I&#x27;ve heard that CEO&#x27;s should do things that others can&#x27;t (sales), but I really hate selling and love coding.<p>I want to grow my startup, so my question is: is it possible with my attitude? Are there any examples of other companies that were run by shy coder?<p>Not sure if I would ever be able to allocate 80% (or even 100%) of my time to sales-related activities.<p>edit: I found this article accurately funny: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getlighthouse.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;company-growth-25-employees&#x2F;",
