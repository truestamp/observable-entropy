      "text": "I&#x27;m a United States resident. I attempted to sign up for a $5 droplet today using my personal Discover credit card. DigitalOcean&#x27;s UI refused to accept the card, simply stating that &quot;something went wrong.&quot; I used their PayPal option instead (ugh, PayPal is evil) and PayPal gladly took the same card and charged it. I was able to order my droplet.<p>I then emailed support and asked them what&#x27;s going on. I got this reply:<p>&gt; <i>Due to a disproportionate number of fraudulent transactions originating from your bank or card issuer, we can no longer accept payments from this institution. In this case, you will need to use a different credit card or use PayPal in order to make a payment.</i><p>My Discover card is issued by Discover themselves; there is no intermediary or third-party involved. Does this mean DigitalOcean no longer accepts <i>any</i> Discover card? Speculating here, but perhaps Discover themselves or whatever payment processor DigitalOcean uses cut them off from accepting Discover cards?<p>What gives?",
