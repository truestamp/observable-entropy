Thousands of twitter accounts being hacked daily and being changed to Elon Musk&#x27;s likeness to scam people. I wonder how they are getting all these accounts..this is thousands of accounts per day, day after day, forever. Brute forcing? Obviously there is some weakness that is allowing this to happen, which twitter is unable or refusing to fix. I am not even sure they are aware of this.<p>Could be something like:<p>1. scape millions of twitter accounts daily<p>2. run a list of the the 100 most common passwords on them,  via cloud clusters , so one IP  per x login attempts.<p>Landing page:<p>BCRYP. NET<p>one of the addresses<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blockchain.com&#x2F;btc&#x2F;address&#x2F;1MuskihuVqz86PGj5ypjeMJhWFDxmtLwbe<p>there are many of these addresses, rotated hourly. the scammer(s) probably earns more in a week than a google engineer or quant makes in a year. 0.11 btc=$7k in just hours. Probably only Forbes 100 execs and top entertainers earn more. But no media coverage about this huge widespread fraud on twitter and how thousands of twitter accounts are being hacked daily. Email scammers make less money yet ISPs cracked down, so why can&#x27;t twitter stop this? We&#x27;re talking millions stolen in stealth mode. Even ransomware gang Revil does not make this much and they take much more risk in terms of feds.",

      "text": "For experienced lisp users: how important have metalinguistic capabilities been for your work? How often do you create DSLs, interpreters, compilers, language extensions, syntactic features, etc.?<p>For those of you who find it vital to the way you work&#x2F;think, do you think the same level of power is possible with anything other than Lisp?<p>Would you rather work with a system that embeds various computational approaches into an environment with metalinguistic capabilities, such as lisp? Or would you rather use a system that glues together various tools that are focused on whatever approach is needed for a specific piece?<p>By computational approaches I guess I mean a lot of different things here. Functional, imperative, and relational programming. Binaries, web UIs, desktop GUIs, etc. I think the main difference would be having different pieces be first class citizens in the core environment.",
