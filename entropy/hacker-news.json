      "text": "I signed up for Copper CRM as I was thinking that I was getting a good deal for their 20% lifetime discount to sign up on May 01 2022. I signed up and realized that this was not the product for me. And I cancelled the service, but these people refused to stop charging and as I just saw my credit card statement, was charged for June as well.<p>I understand that it was my fault completely that I should have used their app for the trial version first before signing up, but having to penalize a client for 12 months and enforce their obligation, because of a 1 day use is in my opinion not a way to treat a customer.<p>In my opinion, what seemed fair and also as I requested them, was to charge me for a full month of May for not checking out the software first.<p>Buyer beware!",
