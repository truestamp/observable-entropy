      "text": "A few years ago, our team built an app that allows you to share a whiteboard (or any analog surface) online, in real time. The reason was simple: we love whiteboards - they&#x27;re very effective; we want to use them when some&#x2F;all of us are not in the same room.<p>At first, the pandemic drove a boom in interest: product managers and developers wanted to whiteboard with distributed teams, educators were looking for tools to run remote&#x2F;hybrid classes. Beginning in late 2021, however, something different started to happen...<p>Many of the people we spoke with - historically, ardent whiteboard enthusiasts - simply stopped whiteboarding altogether. In many cases they replaced actual whiteboards with digital whiteboards (e.g., Mural, Miro). In some cases they changed processes to essentially eliminate the visual collaboration step entirely.<p>IMHO, there are certain cases where a whiteboard is simply irreplaceable. But perhaps I&#x27;m just a luddite? Is the whiteboard dead?",
