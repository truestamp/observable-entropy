      "text": "Microsoft released an emergency patch and stated that the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild. All the news articles describing the RCE are implying that any internet-connected computer running Windows is at risk. This can&#x27;t possibly be true, can it? My question is: does the PrintNightmare RCE (CVE-2021-34527) require a privileged position, such as a Windows user account, or at least local network access? I&#x27;m assuming regular consumer routers do not expose random ports to the internet.",
