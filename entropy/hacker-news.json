I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to the barber.<p>That makes me wonder what other changes people have made that they will stick with. A lot of folks picked up hobbies, video games became even more prevalent, some people grew gardens. Some of those changes were likely just made to kill time and solve boredom and loneliness and once the restrictions are lifted, many will returm to the life they enjoyed pre-pandemic.<p>What changes will stick with you?",
