      "text": "I can&#x27;t help but notice the similarity between an OS instance and an organism. It has a boundary and defenses (firewall), various ways of interacting with its environment (network), it has resources and &quot;organs&quot; of its own (processes, RAM, nonvolatile storage) etc. The instances don&#x27;t (yet) themselves reproduce, but are cloned ad infinitum.<p>The metaphor goes further when recognizing that computer &quot;viruses&quot; infect these &quot;organisms&quot;, commandeering their capabilities for propagation.<p>What if we treated an OS instance more fully like an organism, and allowed it to evolve and &quot;fight&quot; for its survival? Could it become more secure by virtue of its survival being on the line?<p>What if OSes could reproduce sexually?<p>I know this is getting weird but... we use genetic algorithms to evolve solutions to problems.<p>Is there a place for evolving the operating system itself?",
