      "text": "I am starting to appreciate how Python type serve as extra documentation, as well as how they are bing hacked to make stuff like data classes.<p>Nevertheless, I feel they are sometimes overused, and maybe we need to think about guidelines, so we can have a better balance between clarity and verbosity.<p>We learned from experience that clear code doesn&#x27;t need comments. Functions and variables with good naming do not require comments. For example, is the following comment useful?<p># Adding a and b and putting results in c\nc = a + b<p>Not saying that comments aren&#x27;t needed at all. In fact they are essential for the subtle details not that clear. Or as John Ousterhout put it, “Comments augment the code by providing information at a different level of detail.”<p>Now with type hints, I want to argue the same, obvious stuff don&#x27;t need to be annotated. Here are some examples.<p>- <i>args and *kwargs: We all know that these are lists and dictionaries respectively.However, I&#x27;ve seen code where they are annotated still.\n- dictionaries: Like 99% of the time, the dictionary keys are strings, yet I&#x27;ve seen them being annotated with Dict[str, float] or such. Sure, maybe you are dealing with a case where the dict keys are something else, but then I&#x27;d argue that the reader needs to know more about that dict then and what it carries then its types.\n- When a function doesn&#x27;t return anything, should we still annotate it with None, or we are kinda stating the obvious here. \n- When the variable name is obvious. Do I still need to tell the type if the variable is called timestamp, days_since_creation, is_valid, num_item_sold, currency, or amount_paid?  \n- All data scientists use df to refer to DataFrame, the name df should be enough to infer the type and a type hint here will be just noise?<p>The point is, I want to know what do people smarter than me think? Maybe, I am wrong about it, and type hints still offer some value that I miss here.<p>Finally, one might argue that obvious types hints need to be stated still to be enforced by tools like mypy or so. That&#x27;s a different argument, and personally, I feel like type checking is a way to hack a dynamic language like Python to become Java. So, I&#x27;m only interested here in the documentation value of type hints.</i>",
