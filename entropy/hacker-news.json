      "text": "Hello,\nI am looking for a malware scanning service to offer to clients. One that has a good API so we can do the billing and is well priced. And one that is good at detecting any malware on a website.\nDoes anyone have any experience with VirusDie? They look to be good, my only concern is that they not be good at detecting all the different kinds of malware, and i was a little concerned that they are based in Russia, as client may not like that.\nI am after some 1st hand experience if any has any? Or a recommendation on another provider.",

      "text": "I have a need every few months to receive a short message or config file from somebody via Keybase for work purposes. Thing is, I&#x27;d rather not install their app for a lot of reasons, biggest of those being I simply have no trust in Zoom or Keybase whatsoever. It&#x27;s bloated, it&#x27;s unmaintained since the Zoom acquisition, and I have no guarantees that the published source code is actually what they release to the public. There&#x27;s also mention in the readme&#x27;s on github[1] of &quot;privileged tasks&quot; being run; I see no reason they need any privileged access at all, which further erodes any credibility they might have had in my mind.<p>I can&#x27;t get others to switch (I&#x27;ve tried) and I have no choice but to use it <i>somehow</i>, so I&#x27;m trying to find a way to use the keybase CLI, some alternative client should it exist, or some other (preferably not VM based) install method for these infrequent one-offs, but I&#x27;m not having much luck with my search results. I&#x27;d rather void using a VM for this (seems like it shouldn&#x27;t be necessary and it&#x27;s a huge system resource drain for something so small) but will resort to that if there&#x27;s just no other option.<p>So can anyone recommend an alternative installation method or client that lets me use actual real keybase.io without having to run their bloated, untrustworthy abandonware? Thanks for your help.<p>EDIT: I don&#x27;t see any way to use the website to get messages sent to me or files for some reason. Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s an org setting or something, or an app-only feature for some reason.<p>1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;keybase&#x2F;client&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;osx",
