      "text": "I noticed that when there&#x27;s a backlog of notifications in your notifications queue, the phone intelligently shows calendar events at the top depending on when they&#x27;re actually important with other metrics I actively track on the phone, like sleep quality and sleep duration. (This was a sleep reminder based on when the phone saw that I&#x27;m routinely going to bed, presumably). Whereas other calendar events I&#x27;ve been ignoring the last few days due to other obligations did not show up at the top of the queue despite being more recent &quot;events&quot; in my life than some of the backlogged items I still haven&#x27;t bothered to clear out yet.<p>Would be cool to work at Apple on that stuff. Both the hardware and the software are sooo gorgeous. Super smart calendar reminder in the notifications. I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s the notification&#x27;s system being very intelligent about what to show at the top and when, or if it&#x27;s the calendar app itself running checks periodically on what reminders you actually care about historically, and weighing that in deciding which events&#x2F;reminders to put at the top of the queue?",
