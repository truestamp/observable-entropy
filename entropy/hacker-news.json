      "text": "Title says most of it -- I have an interview at $BIGCO for Big Data team.<p>The hiring manager + technical recruiter told me the initial phone screen would be ~1 hour of primarily data structures and algorithm questions. Then a 5-hour virtual interview if I pass, which will focus on Systems Design + Integration and questions about concurrency&#x2F;distributed systems.<p>I&#x27;ve been building software professionally for a bit under a decade. I am not nearly as concerned about the practical interview as I am the phone screen.<p>Never needed algorithms for the sorts of software I build (Microservices&#x2F;API&#x27;s, data tools).<p>How nervous should I be about these algorithm questions? Is it something anyone can pick up in ~1 month of leetcode, or am I screwed?",
