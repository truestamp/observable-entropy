      "text": "I find myself wanting to know if I have this or that variant of a number of genes. Seems like getting a complete copy of my own genome could be useful. But I&#x27;d prefer not to have a third party have a copy of it. I don&#x27;t want to get swept into some FBI search because my genetic code happens to be related to some criminal&#x27;s, or because my skin cells were somehow sitting at a crime scene I walked by or whatever. Also because what can be hacked will be hacked.<p>So... what are my options for sequencing my DNA without ending up in 23andMe&#x27;s database or whatever?<p>There are some sequencers for sale in a price range I could contemplate, such as here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.labx.com&#x2F;dna-sequencers<p>Would a few-thousand-dollars sequencer really do the job?<p>How hard is the prep work?<p>Looking for some thoughts on this topic.",
