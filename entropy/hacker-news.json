      "text": "Hi HN, types-ish &#x2F; FP-ish question. I&#x27;ve asked around and not found a good answer so I wanted to ask here.<p>When I represent a system&#x27;s state, I am often searching for a type that neatly bijects to it. A dumb example is maybe, with a stoplight I might use a tagged union with 3 states (Red | Yellow | Green) over a struct with 3 booleans isRed, isYellow, isGreen, because the latter admits invalid states. A more realistic example is say, in a platformer when I see a boolean isJumping (in the air) and isFalling (in the air and also falling) when a union of (Grounded | Rising | Falling) might be more compact.<p>Likewise I might want to avoid a type having multiple values representing the same state. If I have a time series for temperature from a thermometer that&#x27;s only sometimes on, I might prefer a list&lt;optional&lt;int&gt;&gt; over a list&lt;pair&lt;bool,int&gt;&gt; where the bool is the on state, since the int doesn&#x27;t matter if when it&#x27;s off.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the compact representation is always better but there&#x27;s certainly some utility or at least aesthetic quality. Is there a word for this? The words I&#x27;ve been using here have just been pulled out of the air.",
