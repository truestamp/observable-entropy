      "text": "This question is, of course, related to Russia&#x27;s invasion and the various reactions in so called Western countries.<p>Recently, the main dairy company of Sweden cancelled Kefir (Russian Yoghurt), with a political explanation that the logo looks similar to the famous church near the Red Square. And there&#x27;s been a lot of these things lately. When I&#x27;ve talked to friends and acquaintances about it, we can agree that it&#x27;s a ridiculous thing that doesn&#x27;t change anything. Yet, in PR, media, and other popularity-based professions, there seems to be a very different arrangement of perspectives and emotions.<p>In my opinion, this is an era where more people should be exposed to Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; and similar perspectives, but all we get is some sort of synthetic flock mentality.<p>I was too young to notice all the details in people&#x27;s behaviour in the post-2001 political climate (and I&#x27;ve never been to the US). Anyone with some interesting perspectives who remembers?",
