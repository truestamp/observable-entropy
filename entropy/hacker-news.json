A social media straight out of the camera.<p>A home for all the casual clicks that you would not post on social media, all the funny and weird moments of different circles of friends that eventually get lost when shared via other chat applications.<p>Featuring a moment-centric chat system, retrieve and discuss conversations that happened at the time of the moment.<p>Capturing moments and adding to threads is so easy that you create memories categorized based on threads without even realizing it. You can create multiple threads like one for your dog, one for your loved one, one for your gang, and add your friends to it as well.<p>This place offers zero noise as you can&#x27;t add screenshots or memes or, be it, any jpeg file; you can only add what is captured from the camera.<p>The product is in its early stage and out in play store. We are looking forward to suggestions and thoughts from people for making this product better and probably shedding light in new problems that we can solve.<p>website:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frames.live",
