      "text": "Hi all. I&#x27;m looking for resources, be it courses or books, on how to get better at my job.<p>I already know plenty of resources on how to make better code. But besides programming, I&#x27;m looking to become a better professional by itself. That is, being more reliable, to come up with better and more structured procedures, and to provide good services despite less than ideal contexts (which is, almost every company software project)<p>For starters, I got the book &quot;How to Work Effectively With Legacy Code&quot; for the technical part.\nMy guess is to read about scrum and agile.\nThen about git flow and collaborative software projects.\nThen a bit about devops so I know what platforms support the product I&#x27;m trying to make.<p>Am I missing something?<p>Thanks in advance",
