      "text": "Looking at how big social media companies are operating , their R&amp;D and their stated plans about the future..can we infer that such phenomenon has reached its saturation point?<p>Zuck changed the company name and is now fixated with the metaverse, which is something nobody can really define or understand. Cartoonish characters used as avatars and the other elements put forward in his keynote leave people wondering what will the actual improvement be.<p>Twitter is making the transition towards a &quot;free speach&quot; platform which will now ask people to pay to play, somehow creating synergies with Tesla and SpaceX (???) given the cult of personality surrounding the new CEO.<p>Seems to me like we are really splitting hairs with regards to future improvements and innovation from those companies.",
