      "text": "Company A exclusively utilizes a small set of domain-specific SaaS products to store literally <i>everything</i>. There is nothing of importance on local machines. They are essentially thin clients for a small set of cloud services.<p>This strikes me as precarious, given that everything breaks the moment that something happens to the local internet connection or service providers&#x27; connection (the latter, but not the former, being highly unlikely). It&#x27;s turtles all the way down, and if a single turtle slips and falls so does the business at the top. I&#x27;m the type to use plain text formats stored on a local server, use WAN as little as possible, and keep a gun next to the printer if it makes any weird noises[0], so I&#x27;m (opionatedly) suspicious of &#x27;too much&#x27; cloud.<p>The thing is, Company A&#x27;s setup <i>works</i>. Functionally, the amount of abstraction they&#x27;re playing with is quite powerful, and it makes everything pretty easy for them.<p>The following questions are asked from a technical perspective, <i>not</i> an inter-personal&#x2F;workplace perspective:<p>- Should I work to keep this company&#x27;s data a bit more independent? If everything is working just fine <i>right</i> now, is it really best to start messing with things?<p>- If so, how do I do this incrementally?<p>0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20981980",
