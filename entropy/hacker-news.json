      "text": "TL; DR: What is the most hassle-free way to build a personal blog?<p>---<p>First, I want to explain why I want to save the hassle and save money: My personal blog is ad-free. I just want to write, so it is not worth spending too much time or money (preferably free) on non-writing behaviors, and I do not have the ability to deal with complex, high-maintenance systems.<p>I am looking for a way to blog that is effortless and have minimal maintenance on the server side (like static site generator vs WordPress), a way to write the blog that has a better writing environment on my PC. (Maybe a local CMS or something like that)<p>Few ways I know so far but they are not perfect<p>The first one: WP2Static plugin for WordPress (or other plugins by WP2Static author Leon Stafford [1]). They work, but they have some minor issues, they do not export sites perfectly. Other solutions [2] recommended by Leon I have tried: HTTrack has not been actively developed for a long time (since 2017) and does not work anymore, Wget can&#x27;t crawl the site intact, Shifter, Stratti are expensive (But they run smoothly), HardyPress&#x27; cheap plan has only 500MB, Sitesauce&#x27;s hosting provider Vercel was censored here. (I know, right?)<p>The second approach is called Headless CMS [3]. But after doing some research, it seems that running a fully local Headless CMS requires writing complex API calls (Strapi, etc). Better solutions are either expensive or free but require an account and have some limitations. I would prefer a completely local and free solution (I am so greedy :-|). NetlifyCMS seems great but it seems like it can only be hosted on Netlify?<p>The third way is Ghost [4]. Ghost&#x27;s writing experience looks good, but if deployed to the server, it may require continuous maintenance. Ghost&#x27;s static plugin [5] seems to be not working perfectly. Ghost&#x27;s Headless CMS also requires writing API calls.[6][7]<p>Fourth way: popular services like wordpress.com, Medium, Tumblr, etc. are not accessible in my area, so I can only consider self-hosting.<p>---<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;leonstafford&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wp2static.com&#x2F;alternatives&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamstack.org&#x2F;headless-cms&#x2F;<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ghost.org<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Fried-Chicken&#x2F;ghost-static-site-generator<p>[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ghost.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;jamstack&#x2F;gatsby&#x2F;<p>[7] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gatsbyjs.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sourcing-from-ghost&#x2F;",
