The 54 NFTs will be a collage of 54 dishes from 54 African countries.<p>54 because there are currently 54 countries in Africa. (Yup you guessed right, the campaign is about something related to Africa)<p>Please check out the campaign here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;igg.me&#x2F;at&#x2F;dishafrik<p>Back the project and get one of the 54 NFTs that will be minted.<p>Also feel free to leave a comment if you have any question.",
