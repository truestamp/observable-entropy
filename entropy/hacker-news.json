      "text": "As embarrassing as it sounds, I&#x27;ve never really understood the advantage of having a personal site over the possible downsides.<p>On one hand, if you&#x27;re a professional, you have a reputation to build, but on the other hand anonymity never really was a problem for me professionally.<p>At any rate, I&#x27;m considering giving making a personal site a try, I just am not convinced what the pros and cons really are. This actually may be hard to ask of others, as I know many of us here do prefer to remain anonymous, to greater or lesser extent.<p>I appreciate anyone whom does share their site, since I&#x27;m curious what a personal&#x2F;professional programmer site might look like. Or if anyone whom just has solid advice about my questions is welcome to share it.<p>I know many of us just use github, more or less, as their means of building a professional reputation--but a part of me distrusts social media, even if it&#x27;s github of all things.<p>But I&#x27;m also curious about what stack was used to make your site. I&#x27;ve looked at static site generators, but none I found felt right to me. I guess it&#x27;s one of those cases where if there is no clear winner, then the problem hasn&#x27;t really been solved yet.",
