      "text": "I&#x27;m wasting my life away in search of the one piece of information-that-will-change-my-life. I&#x27;m aware that such a thing does not exist, I&#x27;m aware that I need to just experiment with my life and there are no failure-proof formulas but I find myself constantly battling against this pathetic FOMO.<p>I think we (humans) built a perfect Skinner Box with randomly distributed reinforcement: the Internet is mostly arid, but there you have it, the occasional oasis of useful information, and it keeps you going: &quot;It&#x27;s not all that bad, see&quot; So much knowledge!&quot;. And it appears to be true, but then I look back at what I&#x27;ve learned and it&#x27;s &quot;not much&quot;, but I&#x27;ve looked at what I&#x27;ve lost and it&#x27;s so much: stopped going to the gym, stopped playing my instruments, stopped going to the conservatory, and now I&#x27;m only formally enrolled in University but haven&#x27;t studied in a while.<p>I&#x27;ve tried two years of therapy with 5 different therapists and, sincerely, I&#x27;ve no more money and time to waste in such unfruitful ways. I&#x27;m fairly certain that I&#x27;m depressed, but where the causation lies: it came first the depression or the Intenet addiction? All I can remember is that these kind of tribulation started onw or two years after I was &quot;plugged&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m becoming my worst nightmare, an unsuccessful NEET with a shadow of his former self and intelligence, with no identity anymore. I wish I could just unplug it all: I love the times when we have a blackout or when I go visiting my father without internet connection: I read for more than <i>3 minutes</i>, I relax and <i>without watching youtube</i>. Internet addiction and depression are feeding each other, both symptoms of my malaise and dissatisfaction with my life: the addictive activity promises to be the cure to the problem that itself has caused.",
