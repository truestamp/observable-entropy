It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are a big or small content creator. Many affiliate programs listed in the database are already happy if you can provide them with one new customer.<p>And if you have an affiliate program, consider posting your program to useaffiliates.com to get your product featured in more blogs, videos, or podcasts. Don&#x27;t underestimate how many new customers you can gain who are currently reading a blog by an author with only 100 subscribers.<p>Especially if you have a niche product or service, getting your affiliate marketing in front of creators willing to share your product is invaluable!<p>If you want to read the entire journey of building this project, please check out the whole series here;<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;twankrui&#x2F;building-a-business-from-scratch-in-public-day-1-13pe\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;twankrui&#x2F;building-a-business-from-scratch-in-...</a><p>Hopefully, I can inspire one of you also to start building in building and provide value to new and seasoned creators!",
