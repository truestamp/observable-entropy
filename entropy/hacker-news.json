I am looking at this page here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;braintoblueprinttobuild.wordpress.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;17&#x2F;diy-laser-projector-part-5-building-it&#x2F;  and wondering if rather than using an arduino to generate the signal if the output from a PC soundcard could be used in a similar way to this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCECl4aNz5hvuRzW5fgCOHKQ  is that possible? My friend is interested in projecting Lisserjoos figures and that sort of thing using lasers. It would be great if it could be driven by a PC soundcard output as he could use the output from VCVrack.<p>Sorry if I am asking this in the wrong place?  If so, sorry, is there another forum or another place that you know of that would be a better place to ask this question?",
