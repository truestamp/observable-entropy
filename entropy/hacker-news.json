      "text": "I am currently developing an app that uses customised key-value stores, but am struggling to come up with a simple way to describe this concept.<p>In the app, users can add custom meta data to objects. For example, a &#x27;restaurant&#x27; object can contain metadata with &lt;Rating, Int&gt;, &lt;Website, URL&gt;, &lt;Menu, Photo&gt; and so on. Other another example would be a &#x27;walking goal&#x27; object with custom meta data of &lt;Time Taken, Date&gt; and &lt;Steps, Int&gt;<p>I&#x27;m thinking of words like &#x27;properties&#x27; or &#x27;attributes&#x27;, but I think the word&#x2F;concept can be simplified further.<p>Thanks in advance!",
