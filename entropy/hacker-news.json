I&#x27;ve seen lots of what people want, but how can you compromise these positions in any way? Or perhaps there&#x27;s nothing that works for every company but instead you&#x27;ll pick a place to work partially based on their office policy?<p>(Disclaimer: I have zero power to make these changes in my office or anyone else&#x27;s I just am curious what people think)",
