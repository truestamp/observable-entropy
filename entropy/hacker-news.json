      "text": "Earth warming by 3 °C will lead to mass suffering and death. We must reduce global emissions to below 35 gigatonnes of annual CO₂. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report[0] clarifying that our goal must be 1.5 °C to avoid disaster, not 2 °C. Achieving that means global carbon emissions must decrease significantly before 2030. Today’s emissions are between 40–45 gigatonnes per year. Following the Paris Agreement’s stipulations, global greenhouse gas emissions would still increase, peaking around 52–58 gigatonnes per year by 2030. That would coincide with 3 °C warming by 2100.<p>As individuals, actions having the most impact include:<p>1. Vote for parties aiming to exceed the Paris Agreement.<p>2. Never travel by airplane again (until electric planes take off).<p>3. Eat less meat and dairy (ideally, a soy-free vegan diet).<p>Other actions include:<p>* Choose eco-friendly appliances.<p>* Plant a vegetable garden (eat locally).<p>* Convert your home to solar power.<p>* Invest responsibly by divesting of fossil fuel funds.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcc.ch&#x2F;sr15&#x2F;",
