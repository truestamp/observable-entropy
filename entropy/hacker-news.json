      "text": "Hey, everyone! I&#x27;m making a game: its title is Nests &amp; Insects and I call it a\n&quot;Roguelike Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG)&quot;. It is free, as in beer and\nspeech. You can find the rulebook on the game&#x27;s github repository, linked\nthrough the post title.<p>Nests &amp; Insects is a game for 1 to 7 players, one of which takes on the role of\nthe Game Queen (GQ) and describes the game world to the other players. The\nplayers control characters who explore and interact with the game world. The\nplayers say what their characters do and roll dice to see what happens, then the\nGQ describes the results.<p>Players&#x27; characters are mercenary arthropods raiding a Nest on a Job from a\nrival Queen. Characters belong to one of six classes: Ants (plural), Beetle,\nLadybug, Scorpion, Spider and Wasp, all modelled after real-world species. Nests\nare the nests of eusocial insects: Ants, Bees or Termites. The Job is to\nassasinate the Queen, or the King, or steal larvae, or aphids, or fungi, etc.<p>Nests &amp; Insects is &quot;Roguelike&quot; because it borrows elements from Roguelike\nComputer RPGs (CRPGs): hack-and-slash, dungeon-crawling gameplay, with\nprocedurally generated Nest environments, lethal combat, and a hunger mechanic.<p>The rulebook on the github repo above is all text-based, but formatted with\nASCII borders, text boxes and tables, etc. I wrote a bit of code to automate the\nlayouting (if that&#x27;s a word). You can find the code in the codez&#x2F; directory in\nthe repo. You don&#x27;t need to mess with the code to play the game, but some of you\nmight want to eyeball the raw text with LaTex-like markup under the directory\n&#x2F;game&#x2F;rulebook&#x2F;raw and then look at the layouting code. Or you might want to\ntweak the characters&#x27; stats under codez&#x2F;data&#x2F;, or make your own characters. The\ncode is all in Prolog :)<p>Nests &amp; Insects is still a work in progress. The rulebook is about 60% complete.\nThere&#x27;s rules for rolling dice (oo lots of dice!), action resolution, combat and\nstats for all six character classes and a few enemies (just Termites). If you&#x27;ve\nrun a few TTRPGs you can probably bash together a quick game session, although\nthere&#x27;s plenty of stuff missing (Items, procedural generation, other minigames\nbesides combat etc).<p>I&#x27;m posting here because I&#x27;m eager for some feedback and because I&#x27;m hoping to\nbuild a small community around the game. I&#x27;m in the liminal space between\nfinishing my thesis and actually getting a PhD so I have some spare time, but I\nplan to keep working on the game until it&#x27;s finished, anyway.<p>Also: I&#x27;m looking for ANSI or ASCII art for the rulebook. Anyone know anybody\nwho would want to contribute, please get us in touch.<p>Have fun!",
