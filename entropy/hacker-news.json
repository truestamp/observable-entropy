For example, it could be postcode, country name, business registry number, and so on.<p>I know several open-source PII detection tools that could connect to SQL databases and detect personal data. And some commercial ETL&#x2F;data prep tools could identify semantic types.<p>Is there any deep research on this topic and an advanced tool to work with semantic types?",
