      "text": "I&#x27;m wondering if any one can point me to the right direction here. I&#x27;m trying to connect a USB mouse via bluetooth to my laptop. So I don&#x27;t have to plug and unplug it as I walk away from my desk with my laptop. I could just buy a bluetooth mouse but I prefer to keep this one.<p>All the pieces needed seem to be there. I&#x27;d like to be able to connect my mouse to a Raspberry PI via USB and then have the PI talk to my laptop via bluetooth. The laptop needs to connect to the PI via bluetooth and detect it as a bluetooth mouse. How can I configure the PI to do this?",

      "text": "I am in the market for a new router. I’m open to mesh or just a beefy single router. I’d like WiFi 6 for future proofing but I really want good 2.4 and 5Ghz performance. I only have one device with 6 capability, so I could drop that feature until it is supported more in 5 years.<p>This is an update to this discussion, which frankly I found to echo my experience looking online a year later.\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24756061<p>There is no clear answer on what’s the “best” or even just a universal solid option.<p>Things I’m observing from reviews and comments around the internet:\nMesh isn’t ready and can have mixed performance on satellites.<p>Routers are starting to require logins and subscriptions. I have privacy concerns about those options, so no on Nest.<p>ASUS has quality control and customer support issues, but if you’re lucky they can be good.<p>Some companies don’t continue to update firmware and leave their routers to be vulnerable after a few years. Tp-link is one.<p>WiFi 6 capability can come at the cost of crap 2.4ghz performance.<p>Ubiquiti sounds good or terrible depending on who you listen to.<p>Why is Apple not selling a $400 router that just works, has good design, and slick UI (for Apple devices)? If the performance was good I’d just drop the cash and move on, All I ask is 5 years of security updates.",
