      "text": "I have a little over 3YOE and am being forced into a full-stack role from FE development with backend and devops responsibilities with a lot of engineers leaving. Right now I&#x27;m overwhelmed by the number of things that needs to be handled and learn and don&#x27;t really have many seniors I can lean on for help and guidance.<p>I&#x27;d like to look for a new role and a more suitable workload but even then I am overwhelmed by the interview preparation grind. I&#x27;d like to be able to resign and take time off to focus solely on finding a new role with a more manageable workload but I have bills and loans to pay and a family to support (though this is perhaps adding to my feeling of stress and overwhelm) and would like to burn my savings only as matter of last resort. (but how do I know if I&#x27;m at that point?)<p>Things I have tried or am currently doing:\n- prioritizing sleep and exercise and eating well\n- meditation, maintaining my mental health with biweekly visits to a therapist\n- delegating tasks to juniors (which doesn&#x27;t end as well as I&#x27;d hope)<p>Things I am working on:\n- prioritizing. everything feels so important yet at the end of the day it just feels like I&#x27;m spinning my wheels without making much progress on anything<p>Any tips or suggestions?",

I saw some open-source efforts to run it as web app (which would allow running it on iPad) but I do not think they are ready yet.<p>I am looking for:\n- 11&#x27;+ screen with the quality (resolution&#x2F;brightness&#x2F;etc) comparable to iPad Pro\n- No keyboard or collapsable keyboard (I want to be able to use it as iPad to watch Netflix in bed and such). I assume all OSes now support wireless keyboards.\n- Officially supported OS for VSCode (Windows&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;Mac). Looks like ChromeOS is also supported now.<p>Am I asking for too much?",
