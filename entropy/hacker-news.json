      "text": "I have been interviewing lately looking for a new position. I have mostly worked for start ups throughout my career, but I wonder if I have maxed out on base compensation for what most startups can offer. Currently I am receiving 180k base salary and 10% annual bonus. I&#x27;ve been through a number of interview cycles, passed technical interviews and gotten to the offer stage only to find they can&#x27;t even meet my current compensation or we don&#x27;t even get through the interview cycle because they up front state they can&#x27;t offer that level of salary.<p>I&#x27;ve been hesitant to apply to any of the letters in FAANG due to ethical considerations (perhaps silly, I know), but I&#x27;m wondering if I should just accept that&#x27;s the route I need to follow to meet my compensation needs or what companies there are out there that can pay FAANG level salaries but are more savory in character. I&#x27;ve considered looking into working for companies like Atlassian (no idea if they pay FAANG level, just assuming), Amex, Citadel etc.",
