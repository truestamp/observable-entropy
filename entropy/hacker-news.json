      "text": "Hi HN!<p>Way back in ~2011 I advised a startup, Ginger.up, and got a contract for a small portion of equity in exchanging for advising them. I did some r&amp;d work for them and completed the contract.<p>They moved to SF, I moved to SF, we had a conversation: hey the contract is done, but please keep coming by, after all this only has value if there’s an exit. I did off and on for maybe 1-2 years after end of contract.<p>THE DUMB THING I DID: I misread the contract. I needed to execute the contract right at the end of the 2y advising window. It had a clause, options would be good for ~7 years. I misread that as time to execute. I was wrong. The big moral: get legal advice.<p>Ginger is about to merge with Headspace for a $3bn valuation. I don’t think there’s any recourse at this point (I had a talk with a founder two years ago who was apologetic but said there was nothing to be done,) and I wonder - is there any recourse at this point? Or can I just write up the story and share it so that someone else new to advising doesn’t get f**ed the way I did?<p>Clearly the mistake is mine. Curious if there any avenues I am missing.<p>Thanks!",
