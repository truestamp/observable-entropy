      "text": "The sale of personal information by the government is something that has always really bothered me. This is a bill I drafted that would stop the DMV, voter registration, property tax records, and the post office from selling or publishing without explicit user consent.<p>It would also require personal information to be accompanied with the provenance of that data. This way, a user can track down who or what is publishing their data and take action to end their relationship with that company.<p>I would appreciate any feedback, because I am sure I am missing some second and third order effects that this would have.<p>Document open for comments - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1HVSrRrJwubRmgxTSExN0pEwumbo8REJeEUBK7QCW2gU&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing<p>Privacy should be a right of the people.
