It’s such a shame to make so trivial errors and not catching them on QA stage. I don’t recall something similar before microsoft acquisition. Also about a month ago I reported a bug which displayed inconsistent languages ratio on a random page refresh. It was impossible for me to find the bug report page without googling, nothing changed since",
