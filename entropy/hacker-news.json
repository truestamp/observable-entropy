      "text": "I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and my next job is likely pivotal: I&#x27;ll either decide to be an individual contributor in my field (and manage a couple small teams on the side), or start senior management type positions (managing relationships between larger teams of teams across the enterprise, possibly including a couple of my own small teams, or even go found a company). Either choice comes with opportunity cost. To go the IC route, I&#x27;m likely renouncing a lot of opportunities that presently exist. To go the senior management route, I&#x27;m likely walking away from my subspecialist skill set to a degree that it may be hard to go back to an IC role later.<p>Intuitively, the IC role is &quot;safer&quot;. I know what I can do, and I can grind it out for another 20 years and, retire, and leave my kids a couple properties. The senior management role seems riskier to me. Press, internal politics, external politics. None of which is guaranteed to fall in my favor. I have led before (up to 53 people). I&#x27;ve seen the C suite interactions enough (I was an EA for a couple years) to know there&#x27;s a bunch of it that comes down to high school level politics and the vagaries of scheduling. Why would I give up hard science research and clinical impact to play high school politics?<p>That&#x27;s genuinely the question: why did you do it?",
