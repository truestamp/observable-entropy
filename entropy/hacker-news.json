      "text": "I read that the hackers offered to provide a group &quot;decryptor tool&quot; which would work for all encrypted files, regardless of the company. This got me thinking...<p>In their ransom note, they demanded a Bitcoin payment, for which they promised to provide a decryptor tool which would revert the encryption.<p>Is it just me, or are we seeing a pattern here?<p>They never requested any identifier, meaning that they most likely have a single encryption key, re-used everywhere. They don&#x27;t seem to have a database of keys for each victim.<p>If they are able to provide a &quot;master decryptor tool&quot; which would decrypt files for every one of their victims, this means that the encryption was most likely done with the same key everywhere.<p>Does anyone have the copy of the original encryptor they used? In theory, we should be able to reverse-engineer it and extract the key which was used for encryption, and develop an open-source and free tool which allows their victims to decrypt their files for free, effectively reversing the damage done?",
