      "text": "I am part of transformation team in my company. We want to improve the processes involved in machine learning model development in the data science teams, making them enterprise ready. We realise an MLOPs system could be a major upgrade for the team. Is it worth-it to purchase subscription for MLOPs platform from a third party? Or is it more resource efficient to hire Data engineers and software developers to build bespoke MLOPs systems in-house? Are there any free tools that can be leveraged upon to build the MLOPs system by data scientists themselves?",
