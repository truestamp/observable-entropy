      "text": "We&#x27;ve built our MVP. We&#x27;ve kicked it around internally and with friends &amp; family. It seems to work well though it is far from feature-complete. As of now we can probably support at most 100 users. Signup is easy and self-serve (auth with github; this is a dev tool).<p>We have an initial specific user profile -- individual developers who want to play around with AI&#x2F;ML requiring GPU support but can&#x27;t&#x2F;don&#x27;t want to futz with laptop GPU&#x27;s but also cannot afford first-tier cloud GPU (starts at &gt; $300&#x2F;month).<p>How do we get beta users for this stage in our journey? How did you do it? We know the standard suggestions (hang out where potential users are; get on the radar of influencers; work on FOSS projects that our users care about...)<p>These are all great approaches, but frankly we are nerds and not well-versed in the art of social engineering. Any tips the HN community can provide would be greatly appreciated.",
