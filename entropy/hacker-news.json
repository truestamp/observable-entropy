      "text": "It seem like nix has become quite popular on HN over the last few years... [1] Engineering teams at notable tech companies (shopify, replit) are also beginning to adopt it.<p>But why has it suddenly become so popular? NixOS was first released in 2003. Has Nixpkgs finally hit a critical mass that you can build full projects with it? Did documentation just become much better? Did people just exploring more during covid?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=nix&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story",

      "text": "For context, the codebase I&#x27;m working on is a big ball of mud. Normally, I can map code in my head. But a lot of it is unintuitive, and there are pockets of repeated and hacky code. Boundaries are strictly written in some places, and non-existent in others. There&#x27;s tons of global objects just stored in memory somewhere. A lot of stuff is labeled &quot;item_&quot; and in some generic folder.<p>So I&#x27;d like to draw the architecture to clearly visualize what the architecture currently is, and what it should be. I&#x27;d also like to &quot;zoom&quot; a level, e.g. identify the purpose of a layer, then the implementation of it, and implementations and relations around certain subclasses.<p>I think something like draw.io does the trick, but I figure there are better tools out there. A mind mapping tool could also work, but I haven&#x27;t found any that I&#x27;m more comfortable with over pen and paper.",
