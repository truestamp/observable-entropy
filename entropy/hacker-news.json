      "text": "My sister is studying computer science in Brazil and she&#x27;s looking for internships. She&#x27;s interested in big data and AI, but open to software engineering internships in general. Most companies in Brazil that do CS internships seem to be banks or other big companies where she doesn&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll her skillset as much as she wants. So she&#x27;s expanded her search to companies abroad too.<p>Does anyone know of cool companies that host international students for internships? She&#x27;s open to remote work, as well as part-time (internships in Brazil are usually part-time during the semester so it would be natural; she&#x27;s also open to summer internships). She&#x27;s looking into companies of any size, and she&#x27;s already applied to the Big cos, but she&#x27;s aware that those host few international folks, especially this late in the recruiting cycle.<p>Any leads would be helpful! Also, if there are any online communities (eg women in tech, or otherwise) where she could get mentorship, career advice, and find open-source projects to get involved in, I am eager to relay that info to her as well!",
