For example, a test could incorporate additional sensory modalities or focus on specific aspects of intelligence (such as logical reasoning, mathematical ability, or linguistic skills). Are there any approaches to that?",

Having to constantly explain basic things gets tiring very quickly.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how a non technical person can &quot;lead&quot; a technical team. How can they even help the team because they don&#x27;t even understand basic concepts. How are these people getting these technical jobs is beyond me. I keep running into these &quot;engineering managers&quot; who know nothing about engineering and I&#x27;m sick and tired of it. I just want a technical manager who is on the same level as the technical people on the team or at least understands what the engineers are talking about during meetings.",
