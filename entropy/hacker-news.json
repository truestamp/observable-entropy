When asking what an API returns, I&#x27;ve been told to either read the code for the endpoint, or to manually test the endpoint to see what it returns. If documentation does exist, it is generally a wiki doc or a hand written swagger file that was written when the endpoint was created and is now out of date or incomplete (typically the happy path 200 cases are documented but there is no documentation around edge cases or failure cases). When requesting better documentation I&#x27;m usually told something like &quot;Yeah we&#x27;d all love to have better documentation, but it&#x27;s been deprioritized because of XYZ new product work.&quot;<p>Is this typical? I used to think the companies I worked for were outliers, but at this point I&#x27;ve seen it enough times to think this might actually be relatively common.",
