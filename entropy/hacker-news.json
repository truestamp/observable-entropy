      "text": "I am quite curious about those who attain highly paid job at big tech companies like MAGMA that are still not satisfied with their job. I believe most of the engineers working at big tech should be happy about their position. Yet, I see frequent comments on why people want to quit big tech and work for a local startup or smaller company. Why is it being such a trend?<p>If it is a moral issue or interest conflicts, I completely understand it. Other than that, what may be the reasons? I would like to know your opinions on it!<p>Thank you in advance.",

      "text": "I&#x27;d like to contribute to a repo that&#x27;s conversational and is not code-based, though it can be based around code: say, a guide to coding on Ethereum, or a collection of interesting TypeScript tutorials.<p>Or maybe something much different - a guide to doing quantified self practices, a collection of scripts and resources for playing roguelikes, an ongoing discussion of enterpreneurial or growth hacking practices.<p>I&#x27;d prefer to prioritize repos that 1) aren&#x27;t dead - are active 2) have shown a past openness to accepting PR&#x27;s 3) are relatively quick about it 4) possibly have an indie hacker focus.<p>However, any answers would be appreciated.",
