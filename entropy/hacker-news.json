      "text": "Hey HN! Abboud Chaballout here - founder of Diagnoss - where we aim to free medical providers from the mundane.<p>One of the tools we built reads clinicians&#x27; notes in real-time, as they are charting, to tee up diagnoses they can use for documentation purposes. You can try it here: (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.diagnoss.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.diagnoss.com&#x2F;</a>) without downloading anything.<p>The current workflow of doctors today requires them to (1) type out a patient encounter (e.g. &quot;patient presents with chest pain&quot;) and then (2) use a search bar in their electronic health record system to search and add the chest pain diagnosis code R07.9. If a clinician needs to document 10 different diagnoses, they are going to have to do this second step 10 different times.<p>With Diagnoss, diagnoses needed for documentation are teed up autonomously, so clinicians end up saving time.<p>If you are curious to see how it works when it is fully integrated into a clinician&#x27;s EHR, let me know and I would be happy to share more. Either way, please feel free to share your feedback and&#x2F;or thoughts on supporting medical providers with value-add tools below.",
