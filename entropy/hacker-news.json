      "text": "I&#x27;ve been thinking about the phrase &quot;time in the market beats timing the market.&quot; Not just with investing, but also in career management. After all, that also involves trying to get a greater return on investing your time into some job or skill.<p>But the more I look at the job market in software, the more I see advice for managing a software engineer&#x27;s career like trying to &quot;beat&quot; the market. I don&#x27;t know if I still like this approach. I&#x27;d rather not want to keep trying to predict when the high point of some skill or technology is approaching. I prefer to do what I personally like and only change&#x2F;learn something new because I get bored, and not because the job market doesn&#x27;t favor it.<p>Tech trends feel like moving targets, and I have a dilemma. I like working in tech but I also don&#x27;t like being forced to hit moving targets.<p>To give you an example, I started my web development career in the late 2000&#x27;s. I didn&#x27;t &quot;buy&quot; into cloud computing when it went on the rise, and I didn&#x27;t &quot;sell&quot; my PHP skills. That&#x27;s making it tougher to get interviewed at jobs probably because my experience doesn&#x27;t have enough of the right keywords. Trying to just keep up with new concepts just for the sake of the job market is stress-inducing and it&#x27;s like constantly monitoring stocks to buy and sell. It&#x27;s an emotional roller coaster.<p>Is it just possible to hold on to your initial &quot;investment&quot; of skills long-term, and regardless of what you started with continue to build returns from that? I know that the advice to just spend more time in the market is advice for the regular joe, but I actually do just want to be a regular joe programmer.",
