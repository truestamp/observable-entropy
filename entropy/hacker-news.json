      "text": "With the recent news of open source projects burning out due to lack of support, I&#x27;m looking to suggest to my small employer that we start making financial contributions to some projects, but I have no idea where to start. I know this might only be a small amount of money, so I&#x27;m keen to make it go as far as possible, but I don&#x27;t know where to start.<p>Where can I find a list of open source projects and dependencies used the most? Is &quot;used the most&quot; even the best place to focus?<p>Are Github sponsors or a Patreon style model a good approach?<p>Does anyone have any experience proposing this to an employer. Does any resources exist to lay out the value and impact in a clear way?",
