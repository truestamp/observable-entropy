Actually, it turns out that I need this kernel param on my work laptop too, which is another popular Dell Latitude laptop. This has been required for over a year now, despite keeping up with all the OS updates. Why is this still happening? I appreciate all the volunteers working on Linux, but do none of them use popular hardware?",
