      "text": "I know there have been threads like this in the past about sporadic difficulties, but from my own experience and complaints here and on twitter, I&#x27;m wondering if pinboard.in&#x27;s paid archiving service is broken, and if there is any chance of a fix; and if not, what people have moved on to as an alternative.<p>For the last 4 months, my paid archiving account has almost completely stopped archiving bookmarks. I tried setting up another account as a trial, and that had the same problem. Worse, my wife made an account last summer, and the full text search of her bookmarks has never worked at all (it throws up an error message).<p>I&#x27;ve sent several emails to Maciej over the last few months without any replies (apart from one email cancelling the extra account I&#x27;d set up, so I know my emails are received).<p>This is a really frustrating experience! I&#x27;ve been really happy with Pinboard for many years, and paid up front for several years of archiving. There is also now a wonderful MacOS&#x2F;iOS client (&quot;Pins for Pinboard&quot;).<p>I feel bad posting a thread here, but it seems to be impossible to contact support, and I hope that there are still other Pinboard users (and perhaps even Maciej) here who might have more of an idea what&#x27;s going on (e.g. whether this is affecting all accounts).<p>I would really love to be able to carry on using Pinboard, but I have no idea whether to expect it to ever start working again.",
