      "text": "Im finally ready to share a fun side project that I&#x27;ve been working on.<p>For 20 years, Ive been fascinated with Mandelbrot fractals. Back in the day, I made a MacOS9 app that rendered them, and I missed it. So, I decided to bring it up to the modern age and build a website to explore this and other similar fractals.<p>In the process, I discovered some other types of generative art that looked fun, so I made those too.  One is a spirograph, another is similar to an old AfterDark screensaver called Satori (anyone remember that?). Others draw paint splatters and random squiggly lines.  The user is given a bunch of interactive settings to control how the artwork is generated.<p>Im hoping to continue adding different styles of generative art to the website over time. Its a fun, relaxing project to work on and I hope other people enjoy using it to create pleasing images.",
