For this most of the hiring has been external-those who have worked on those technologies or people who can sell themselves well and are buddies with management.<p>Despite learning Spark,dbt on my own and getting certifications in Azure, my management does not staff me in those migration and newer projects since I am doing a good job maintaining the legacy stack. I want to grow but even getting another job will need me to show that I have worked on a newer tech stack. What should I do?",
