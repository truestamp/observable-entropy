      "text": "I&#x27;m a mid-30s German guy. I just broke up with my g&#x2F;f after 10 years of relationship. I quit my job. And I&#x27;m about to leave my appartment behind. I have 40&#x27;000 Euro cash and 60&#x27;000 Euro in ETFs&#x2F;stocks.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what really smart people who know a thing or two about business would do with say 50&#x27;000 Euro  in my situation. And when I look for smart people online I tend to check out hacker news. How could I invest it in a way that symbiotically connects with starting a &quot;new&quot; life? 50k or even 100k is nowadays an amount that&#x27;s on one hand a lot of money but on the other hand not enough to buy anything really significant. I mean there are houses for 50k but I&#x27;d have to invest a lot of money to renovate etc and they&#x27;d be in the middle of nowhere which comes with further costs. So - yeah, I don&#x27;t know.<p>Let&#x27;s consider it a thought experiment. You get an opportunity (or just thrown into that situation) to start from an almost blank slate and you have 50k and no debts. What would you do?",
