      "text": "What’s the best domain registrar that best fits the follow criteria?<p>- No crazy upsells when buying a domain: GoDaddy is out\n- No bloated domain management UI: I’ve seen some terrible over-engineered JS heavy management UIs)\n- Prices in the cheaper side: I don’t need rock bottom prices, but I’d like to have competitively priced domains\n- Secure: must support MFA via OTP or YubiKey. Sadly iwantmyname doesn’t make the cut because they are still using Authy instead of OTP<p>Bonus would be a domain registrar with a CLI. I’d get payment and everything setup in a browser and check availability and make reservations in a CLI.<p>What are your top picks and recommendations?",

      "text": "So I recently launched a new startup called Wavestack.\nThe idea is that rather than paying $3000+ to an agency or freelancer to get a decent website for your small business or early-stage startup, you pay only $79&#x2F;mo to us for a very good website.\nIt&#x27;s not a website builder. We&#x27;re a team of senior developers who help small businesses get their business online in an efficient but affordable manner.\nBut do you think many small businesses will be interested in this, though?<p>*For those who will like to check it out, here is the link to the website: www.usewavestack.com",

      "text": "I read the popular article a few days ago about the person who works in VR using the Quest2. I was so inspired I bought one to try it out. My initial reaction is that it is SO BLURRY that it is unusable. If you google &quot;oculus quest 2 blurry&quot; you will find thousands of other people saying the same thing. How is this possible? How are some people able to use this and other people find it unusable?<p>Basically there is an incredibly tiny &quot;sweet spot&quot; in the very middle of your view, and everything else is painfully blurry.
