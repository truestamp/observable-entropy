We made a smarter way for lending and borrowing between friends, family, and people in your community.<p>On social media (Twitter, Facebook, reddit) people will randomly ask for help or complain about a loan situation they are dealing with. We are often able to DM these people and bring them to our platform at a very high rate. The challenge is manually looking for all these conversations.<p>Current tools are bringing in too much noise (a lot of irrelevant conversations). We are willing to pay for someone to build an effective solution for us as it will bring in real business. Perhaps even one that uses machine learning and GPT-3 to get better over time.<p>Let’s chat if you have an idea or a product you can point us too.",
