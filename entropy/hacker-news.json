      "text": "I finally bought a new MacBook Pro 14” M1 Pro a few days ago.<p>I come from Linux background and have been using mostly Arch Linux with i3. Any tips on how setting up my macbook as a developer machine would be appreciated.<p>Right now I’ve installed Home-brew and iTerm2 so you might be pretty sure that I’m going into that UNIX side of Apple, but I’m still eager to discover wonders of that “creative” or even “regular day to day usage” parts.<p>Any recommendations on software or even sharing dotfiles as examples would be highly appreciated :)",
