      "text": "I really enjoyed Evernote for the longest time with their legacy app. It&#x27;s easy to use, intuitive, and most importantly does not feel clunky.<p>The new Evernote is the exact opposite, it&#x27;s slow, buggy and most annoyingly, its way-too-frequent update pop-ups goes straight to my face and interferes with whatever that I&#x27;m working on at the moment. This is not something new to complain but I think a revolt to quit Evernote should be started since they apparently have been ignoring us!<p>Let&#x27;s quite Evernote for good, whatever cost it may be, no more straight-to-my-face pop-ups.",

      "text": "Hi, my wife is an amazing developer who loves programming and graduated from a well recognised university in Computer Science. She however got stuck as an SAP ABAP consultant because she was placed in Deloitte from college. She spent the last 10 years working as a sincere employee and only switched companies once. As a result her current compensation is peanuts in comparison to most of her classmates who went on to work at FAANGs or even regular startups. I&#x27;ve been trying to get her to switch to literally any other kind of programming, whether it&#x27;s web development or game development because the job market is not artificially capped and controlled by the consulting companies. SAP ABAP consultants are a dime a dozen in India, they are severely underpaid with respect to developers who work with languages that are open and free to use. Is it too late for her to just leetcode and join a startup or FAANGs? What should she put on her resume, since it&#x27;s all exclusively ABAP experience? She&#x27;s also an excellent manager&#x2F;team lead however because the consulting world is pretty much driven by years of experience and not skill, she had never been able to find an engineering management role within consulting. Any feedback&#x2F;advice is greatly appreciated.",
