      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I create, develop and contribute to Open Source Projects. I am passionate about programming and things about Computers in general. Over past few years, I use Linux, studied many things about computers, developed few programs, many times out of my own interest and did many projects too.<p>I pursue Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and most people here solve &quot;Leetcodes&quot;, competitive programming and some hackathons about the same, instead of real and interesting programming (like C fundamentals, solving interesting CS problems, other good application-development and having hacker mindset).<p>I also came to know that these leetcodes, competitive programming, codechef problems are only things that matters to get good job.<p>Here comes the part, I am not so good at solving leetcode and I am not good at competitive programming either. I am normal human being and I too desire to get good Tech Job that can provide me good life and elevate me financially. I am feeling inferior because despite learning, working and developing programs and applications, studying computer science and being good at it to an extent, I won&#x27;t be getting anywhere good.<p>So, is leetcode everything to get good job? doesn&#x27;t being good at computer science or domain doesn&#x27;t count? I have lately come to know that many people in my country do grind leetcode from young age(from college) and for few years despite not having good knowledge in domain or fundamentals or in programming. I feel that I can&#x27;t outcompete these leetcoders as they have made it their only habit for years and my hopes are futile and I feel bad about it.<p>So,what are my options?",
