You can&#x27;t access this item because it is in violation of our Terms of Service. If you feel this is in error, please request a review. Find out more about this topic at the Google Drive Help Center.&quot;<p>If I click the request a review I get:<p>&quot;404. That&#x27;s an error. Sorry, this item cannot be found or is not available.&quot;<p>This spreadsheet simply had metrics and domains. I find it near impossible it was violating any terms of service unless there is a shadow blacklist of domain names which somehow trigger a file being removed. And I&#x27;m left with no recourse to even request a review or get my file back?<p>I turned on airplane mode on my phone and was able to get an old cached copy, export was only possible as a PDF. So at least I have a slightly stale version of raw data that way.<p>Even as a paying customer, this is pretty embarrassing and there seems no recourse is possible?",
