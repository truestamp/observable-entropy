The best I&#x27;ve got is a jumbled mess of bookmarks, with no notes, I rarely look through.<p>I ideally want a system that is great for personal resources in which I can add notes, personal thoughts and findings and that is easily shareable with teams.<p>How are you guys managing the resources you stumble upon? Have you found a super-bookmarking system, and if so which one (or which combination of apps)?",
