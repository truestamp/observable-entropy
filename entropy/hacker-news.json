      "text": "YouTube did it. It managed to get me to subscribe. With loud (way louder than the videos), repetitive, unskippable ads that has nothing to do with me, I figured YouTube was trying to bully me into paying, so I did. I payed, so I could enjoy videos without being interrupted every 5 minutes. But you know what? YouTube is still not happy. Today when I opened the app on my phone, it still showed me an add. It is infuriating at least. This won&#x27;t probably make it, but I needed to share.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;BM7XoTe<p>The image above is an ad inserted in the middle of the recommend content, but before that there was a full page ad about the same crap, which I could not get a screenshot.",
