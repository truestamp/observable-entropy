      "text": "Hi,\nI&#x27;ve had a few jobs as a web developer, mostly in startups.\nI spent ~2 years in college doing software engineering(mostly C, algorithms&#x2F;DS, web dev, but I started coding a long time before college)\nI got offered a job before graduating and needed the money so I couldn&#x27;t stay in school.<p>Do you think if I spent 6 months or +1 year on MOOCs&#x2F;Books&#x2F;personal projects, I could land a decent job as a junior ML engineer or something similar?Not at a FAANG or anything like that. Just a decent job.<p>Or do you think it&#x27;s absolutely necessary to go through a Master&#x2F;PhD to get a decent job in that field?\nI honestly don&#x27;t think there is a (great)future in web dev plus it&#x27;s starting to bore me, so I want to switch.<p>Btw I&#x27;m based in western Europe.<p>Thanks",

      "text": "A while back on Youtube, quite a lot of videos popped up[0][1][2] about Skoda sticking their own logo over the Volkswagen logo on their engine covers. Then, this craze suddenly dropped off and I never heard anything about it.<p>Those videos also amassed a peculiar amount of dislikes, suggesting this was either fake or people were very unhappy with Skoda about this.<p>I&#x27;ve always been quite curious about this, and whether or not other manufacturers &#x2F; companies partake in the same (seemingly quite lazy) branding schemes. I suppose what I&#x27;m asking is: is this just standard practice, or frowned upon by the industry, and are these videos fake?<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;q8tur1sUvhc?t=58<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s-7PaqS2gZA<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Etf3yMznKN4",
