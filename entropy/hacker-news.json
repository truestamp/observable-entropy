It requires another 4 years to fully vest those 400k options.<p>We raised totally about $10M and have about 55M shares outstanding. Our current 409A value is $0.07. The company is going to raise series A in the next 15 months.<p>My cash comp is around $60k. I have another offer at $120k.<p>Should I stay at current company for options in the next 4 years or should I join the new one (pure cash, no options)?<p>What questions should I ask the founders to be able to gauge these?",
