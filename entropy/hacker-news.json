      "text": "Recently I interviewed with Stripe for an engineering MoM (Manager of Managers) for one of their teams. I interview regularly, so I am used to many types of processes, feedback mechanisms, and so on. I won&#x27;t go into details about the questions because there&#x27;s nothing special about them, but I wanted to share some details of my experience for people thinking of interviewing there.<p>1) About 35-40% of the interviewers started their questioning by saying &quot;I will only need 20 minutes for this&quot;, while emphasizing it is an important leadership position that they are hiring for. So 20 minutes is all needed to identify &quot;important, critical leaders&quot;? What a strange thing to say - also a GREAT way to make candidates feel important and wanted!<p>2) There is significant shuffling of interviewers and schedules. One almost has to be on-call to be able to react quickly.<p>3) For an engineering manager position, I only interviewed with only technical person. To me it hints that Engineering MoM is not a very technical position.<p>4) Of all the people I spoke to, the hiring manager was the one I spoke the least with. The phone screen was one of the &quot;I only need 20 minutes for this&quot; calls. The other one was quite amusing, and is described below.<p>5) After the loop was done, the recruiter called me to congratulate me on passing, and started discussing details of the offer, including sending me a document described the equity program. Recruiter mentioned that the hiring manager would be calling me to discuss the position next.<p>6) SURPRISE INTERVIEW! I get a call from the hiring manager, he congratulates me on passing the loop, then as I prepare to ask questions about the role, he again says &quot;I need to ask you two questions and need 20 minutes for this&quot;. Then proceeds to ask two random questions about platforms and process enforcement, then hangs up the call after I answer. Tells me he&#x27;d be calling in a week to discuss the position.<p>7) I get asked for references.<p>8) After passing the loop, have the recruiter discuss some details of the offer, have the hiring manager tell me they&#x27;d be calling me after a week, I get ghosted for about 3.5 weeks. References are contacted and feedback is confirmed positive.<p>9) I ping the recruiter to see when the offer is coming - it&#x27;s not coming. They chose another candidate. I am fine with it, even after being offered verbally, but the ghosting part after wasting so much of my time seems almost intentional.<p>10) I call up a senior leader in the office I applied to, an acquaintance of mine. His answer: &quot;don&#x27;t come. It&#x27;s a mess and a revolving door of people&quot;. I was shocked with the response.<p>11) I get called by the recruiter saying that another director saw my feedback and is very interested in talking to me and do an interview loop.<p>Guess I&#x27;m not joining, then.<p>I am ok with passing loops, being rejected, I&#x27;ve seen it all. But being ghosted after acceptance is a first. What a bizarre place this is.",
