As developers, we know code can be tricky to read – even for the original developer.<p>You spend lots of time writing code, but when it comes time to debug and understand it… well, that&#x27;s where things get hairy.<p>I&#x27;m working on a solution called Explain Code App for this, which brings me here to reach out to others in order to truly bring a solution to the community as a whole. \nHere is the link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.explaincode.app&#x2F;<p>With that said, I&#x27;m looking for people who would like early access to the platform and test out the tools and provide feedback. Thank you so much!",
