      "text": "I started a new gig ~6mo ago and I&#x27;m basically getting bullied out by people below&#x2F;beside me.  I&#x27;m not happy with how my manager or the execs have handled it and while it&#x27;s technically resolved, I don&#x27;t want to stay in an org that allows such behavior.<p>I going to trash about 400k in equity to leave and that&#x27;s acceptable to me (nothing is vested), but with hiring and salaries being crazy right now, is it insane to take a 6mo-1yr career break?  I have savings, but I&#x27;ve only been making 150k for the last few years and I&#x27;m worried the opportunity cost here is too high to ignore.",
