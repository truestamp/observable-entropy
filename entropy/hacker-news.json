      "text": "I&#x27;m an engineer at an agency in the Midwest. We have a FAANG as a client. I like my current company, but since I&#x27;m always assigned to projects for the FAANG, which I enjoy — and since FAANGs of course pay their employees very well — I decided to apply for and was offered a job there. (Contractually our clients can&#x27;t &quot;poach&quot; us, but we&#x27;re free to apply wherever.)<p>As I say my good-byes, when other employees learn where I&#x27;m going they sound very interested in applying, themselves. I feel a little bad about starting some kind of exodus, since the agency has treated me well. My boss didn&#x27;t really even counter-offer since he admitted that the agency can&#x27;t hope to compete with FAANGs.<p>This makes me curious — how do agencies&#x2F;consultancies prevent this from happening?<p>Of course some employees will prefer agencies for various reasons, but the benefits and pay of big tech companies are really appealing, and far beyond what most agencies could afford.<p>Are executives aware that this is a risk when they win a contract with a FAANG?",
