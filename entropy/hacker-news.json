From the entry:<p>&gt; The annus mirabilis papers (from Latin annus mīrābilis, &quot;miracle year&quot;) are the four papers that Albert Einstein published in Annalen der Physik (Annals of Physics), a scientific journal, in 1905<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had my miracle year yet though, but there were certainly years in my twenties where I was supremely productive, and lately I&#x27;m just trying to recapture the wild creativity of those days and be more elastic &amp; serendipitous especially when it comes to creativity.<p>Have you had your miracle year yet? Are you aiming to have one?",
