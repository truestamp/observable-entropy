Often engineers re-negotiate salaries based on other offers (and few reject at last minute). Not great response for stock options. Instead, many prefer fixed salary.<p>Should we consider hiring-remote? Is this a good option for early stage start-ups. We founders felt its good to work under a roof to ensure good handshake on all active threads. Any inputs on this are appreciated.",
