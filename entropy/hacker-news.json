I was trying to recall any pivotal moments but have to go pretty far back. I&#x27;m also excluding overcoming slowdowns from abstractions because we could.<p>The last time I remember computers being very slow was waiting for C++ compiles in the late-90&#x27;s&#x2F;early-00&#x27;s. Of course C++ compiles could still be slow for people, but I haven&#x27;t had reason to need to use C++ since because of languages like Java or Go.<p>We always want faster server software as there can be many users using it at once, but even then an SQL db, indexes, and thoughtfully written queries generally get the job done. I remember there was a time that vertically scaling&#x2F;federating dbs was almost not enough on bare metal, but add sharding and there&#x27;s very little that you can&#x27;t handle unless you&#x27;re FB&#x2F;Twitter.<p>[The slowest things I&#x27;ve run into in the last decade was Spring&#x2F;Boot startup, and a React front-end where running all the assembly (TypeScript, CSS, images, polyfills, what-have-you) took over 30s to reload a page.]",
