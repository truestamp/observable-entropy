      "text": "I&#x27;m an enthusiast who&#x27;s been frustrated by how time-consuming it is to screen upcoming NFT drops. So much so that I decided to develop my own NFT screening tool. NFT Sorter, found here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftsorter.com&#x2F;.<p>- At any given time, NFT Sorter lists over 150+ projects sorted by engagement.\n- The database is updated daily, adding the newest announced drops and archiving projects after their drop date.\n- Clicking project titles link to the collection&#x27;s Discord, Twitter, and website.\n- Sort by Twitter followers, number of tweets, average likes, replies, retweets, and drop date.\n- Search by specific terms.\n- Narrow results according to your requirements.<p>The site is in a free open beta. I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback in the comments or on our discord.<p>Thank you!",
