      "text": "This happens to me quite often, and it&#x27;s always negative. Searching I&#x27;ve found bullshit books preaching self-improvement, etc.<p>What I&#x27;ve found personally is that when it happens I am completely lost. First time it happened as a child I woke up and felt like everything had shifted a few inches. This sounds small but it made everything look completely different - my room, parents. It drove me nuts.<p>Later when visiting my mother at her complex I was driven through a different entrance and was lost in a place I&#x27;d grown up in. I couldn&#x27;t find friends&#x27; houses. I was called a liar and told I was being melodramatic when I asked for directions somewhere.<p>My parents added it to one more &#x27;weird&#x27; thing I did (I have OCD which wasn&#x27;t well-understood in the early 80s- I had to have things even&#x2F;symmetrical, had to rub my hands together when excited, blink every time a light post passed my peripheral, then was forced to stop that but I still had to notice them and <i>felt</i> them passing, etc). When Poirot stepped in crap to have it on both shoes- I teared up at that, someone understood- not Poirot obviously, but Agatha Christie.<p>Anyways I&#x27;ve found that sometimes if I enter a familiar parking lot from a different direction I&#x27;m completely lost until I think about entering from a different direction again and aligning my perspective to that, if that makes sense. Suddenly I know where I am and how to get where I need to go, but this gets exhausting. Legit stores all around I&#x27;ve been to several times, yet I don&#x27;t recognize them, it&#x27;s just <i>a</i> starbucks, <i>a</i> Taco Bell.<p>It feels like it&#x27;s happening more often so I&#x27;m wondering if any of y&#x27;all have experience with this, and if you found a way to stop it, or at least mitigate the effects?<p>I wonder if this is what happens when people get dementia and can&#x27;t recognize anything. If someone who doesn&#x27;t look like themselves to you insists they are who they are what do you do?",
