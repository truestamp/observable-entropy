I&#x27;m not 100% sure what it is I&#x27;m even asking for, which is part of the motivation for this thread; hoping that someone more knowledgeable might be able to guide me in the right direction.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for is this:<p>- Champions of Free and Open Source Software &#x2F; Hardware, Right to Repair, and other like causes\n- A full-time or part-time role (with other programming responsibilities) within a product or consulting company which gives time and resources to a team of like-minded folk, or\n- A full-time position as a writer &#x2F; evangelist &#x2F; technology new reporter, or\n- A policy oriented position with a US politician, or\n- Everything else that I&#x27;m not thinking of...<p>I&#x27;m a coder by training and at heart, but I currently am having a hard time turning a blind eye to the state of our industry. I&#x27;m thinking I should at least try and ask about way I can devote my time to the solution.<p>On that note, if a paying job addressing these issues isn&#x27;t really in the cards, I&#x27;d be curious to hear how others are making meaningful impact in their free time.<p>Thanks.",
