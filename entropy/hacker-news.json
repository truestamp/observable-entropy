      "text": "I am working and have developed a light weight Automatic Speech Recognition that currently work decent on noisy data e.g. noisy call center audio recording. Based on my initial testing we outperform all ASR API provider by quite a significant margin. The current model has been trained on English (Indian accent) and Hindi language. I can train it on USA accent data as well. Given light weight nature of the ASR, we are quite cost effective and thus pass on this benefit to our customers. I wanted to know developers who are using any 3rd party ASR solution, what are you using ASR service for? What is the average usage for ASR service look for you? And how much are you roughly paying for such service.",
