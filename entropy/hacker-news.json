      "text": "In my ads on iOS – when playing a paid videogame – I always see the same stuff: Fishdom, Bingo, Dominoes, Home Escape, they are so obsessive, frustrating and manipulative that make me hate playing the videogame.<p>Why there are so few software companies advertising in my iOS? Why I see always the same gambling apps? How can I see instead ads from &quot;real&quot; apps that are not scams &#x2F; gambling like these?<p>Not only these ads are even showing screens and gameplays that are very different once downloaded, they do have tons of negative reviews yet a very higher rating. They also force me to interact with them in order to start that silly 30s timer until I can close them. Sometimes they crashes. Sometimes they cannot be closed<p>I&#x27;m very curious about how the industry of ads - especially gaming - is working. How is acceptable from a company like Apple that they are advertising spam and scams?",
