      "text": "I am a going to be a new grad and I just got offered to be a CTO for a startup and I&#x27;m not sure what my compensation should look like.<p>Some background: A year or two ago I worked for them on contract for 3 months and was &quot;1&#x2F;3 owner&quot; of the company. I left on really good terms to do a few internships and research and gave up the equity. They are now on track to make 800k in ARR this year and growing quickly. They have been bootstrapped to date but have received a few term sheets and it looks like they are going to raise a seed round of a few million right now and are looking for someone to work on their tech (they are mostly service based, but need tech to scale)<p>I have an offer for ~220k at a mid size company that I accepted in November. I would like to work at this startup, but not sure how much to ask for. I think I want at least 110k salary, but not sure how much equity to ask for. 5%? 10%? Also would it make sense to have it vest over time or tie it to milestones?<p>I believe in the company, and want to get as much equity as possible, but I&#x27;m not sure what is appropriate to ask for",
