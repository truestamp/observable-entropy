      "text": "While looking for an NPM package to handle keyboard input, I ran across the package `@fluentui&#x2F;keyboard-key` from Microsoft&#x27;s fluentui repository - but when going to install it, I noticed that their README asked me to install a slightly different package: `keyboard-key` – without the namespace.<p>Curious, I went to take a look at the package that Microsoft&#x27;s README recommended I install, and found out that said package had an <i>identical</i> README, but a different author, and a different LICENSE:<p><pre><code>    Copyright (c) 2018 Levi Thomason\n</code></pre>\nAs opposed to Microsoft&#x27;s copy, which reads:<p><pre><code>    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation\n</code></pre>\nIf you take a look at the source of these two packages, they&#x27;re obviously related. The exported API is the same, the comments are mostly the same, and if you take a look at the commit history of fluentui, it turns out that Microsoft was <i>originally</i> using Levi Thomason&#x27;s keyboard-key package. The commit where they forked it is here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;fluentui&#x2F;pull&#x2F;13264&#x2F;files<p>My question: is this kind of blatant copying and then reassigning of copyrights by megacorps legal? And if not, is there anything we can do it?",
