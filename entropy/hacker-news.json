I believe they had two completely separate projects that were developed independently for open-source and proprietary.<p>I&#x27;m just looking for any reading to help avoid mistakes. Maybe companies follow a purely dynamic extension method. Maybe they solely keep diffs around (that sounds crazy). I don&#x27;t know.<p>Any pointers to read about would be welcome!",
