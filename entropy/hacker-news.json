      "text": "Spoiler: rant.<p>I don&#x27;t know what happened exactly but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the lack of dislike stats, that now my suggestions and home page of youtube is filled, and I mean FILLEDDD!, with videos that have 4k stock clips, catchy title, but completely lacking in content. Misleading 100%. Not 1, not 2, but like 8&#x2F;10 videos are now garbage stock footage with bs commentary over nothing.<p>Example:<p>Nasa just discovered truth about solar system!?!?!?!<p>Science has progressed a lot in last 100 years....<p>So and so first discovered pluto in 1xxx<p>Mayans used to think balbala...<p>Some historians think....<p>Now scientist finally have answered....<p>New evidence (2014 research) shows there might be a planet ...<p>No explanation of study because you know it actually requires some comprehension...<p>Insert failed attempt at humor...<p>Leave a comment on your thoughts..<p>===========<p>Same script, like 8th grade essay you didn&#x27;t study for, but multiplied by 100x.<p>We knew it was gonna ruin youtube, people told youtube it was gonna ruin it, and now exactly that happened. Click baity videos with nice stock footage that is barely relevant and half assed &#x27;answers&#x27;.",

      "text": "Hi,<p>I am currently working partly remotely and partly from home. Both in the office and at home I have a Linux desktop. In preparation for this configuration, I have gather up my dotfiles, and created Ansible scripts that have allowed me to get up and running quickly on both environments. However, time is passing and I see these environments slowly diverging. I don&#x27;t want to apply every change to Ansible manually. I also do not want to always start the day by checking my git repositories if I did not make a small modification to dotfiles yesterday. I am looking for tools, scripts that will help me maintain my environments.",
