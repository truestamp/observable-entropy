      "text": "Google Search keeps bothering users by showing unnecessary list of &quot;People Also Search for&quot; message among search results. This is especially annoying when you visit a page and go back to the search results page. Because of this stupid &quot;People Also Search for&quot; message, the search results get shifted down every time you go back to the search results page, so you might click on a wrong link.<p>This is insane because at the bottom of the search results (right above the page numbers), the same message &quot;People Also Search for&quot; is shown again!!<p>Google is a huge company and hires the brightest minds.  But I keep wondering, who the heck came up with this user-hostile &quot;feature&quot;? This is honestly driving me to use DDG or something else.",
