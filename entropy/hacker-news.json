      "text": "I recently just failed a technical task, it&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve failed in the last month. First one took me 4 hours and got rejected due to not being production ready.<p>Usually I get failed for the following reasons<p>- Didn&#x27;t split code into separate files (refactoring)\n- Expected more tests\n- Not doing the stretch goals\n- Rudimentary XXX\n- Would have liked to seen use of XXX (technology not included in the starting template)\n- Didn&#x27;t use GitHub (publicly broadcasting my job search)<p>I&#x27;m just wondering how common practice it is to lie about how long these tasks take?<p>In my most recent test, I included a time breakdown of how long various parts of the task took me, and still got rejected based on a &#x27;rudimentary&#x27; submission. There was literally no more time left to implement the feedback. I left the computer once to go to the toilet, and I took a minute to plug in my monitor, and other than that, flat out coding.<p>I see &#x27;should take no more than 2 hours&#x27;, on web-apps that include multiple components, responsive design, asynchronous state management and reading&#x2F;understanding the brief.<p>It&#x27;s at the stage I would prefer hacker rank tests now, as there is at least transparency and honesty about how long things should take and do take.<p>This feels a bit ranty, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find out if this is the norm, or the exception. UK based Front-End Dev. Do I need to start lying, or just accept that I&#x27;m going to have to spend 40 hours doing the same basic task over and over until I get the next job?",

I&#x27;ve been reading postings similar to my current job for several weeks and they all seem lower than what I&#x27;m currently at. Are companies listing salaries lower than they are willing to actually pay? Or am I just making an above market salary?<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear if anyone else is watching the salary ranges and to hear their opinions on them. Does anyone have stories of applying for jobs in Colorado and negotiating their salary above the posted range?",
