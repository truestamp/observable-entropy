      "text": "I have been meaning to do a &quot;Show HN&quot; for SudokuToo for over a year, but I&#x27;ve kept putting it off as there was always &quot;just one more thing&quot; I wanted to add. However, I&#x27;ve decided that it&#x27;s now time to just put it out there as it stands.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playsudokutoo.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.playsudokutoo.com&#x2F;</a><p>I first built it in December 2020 after my wife and I kept &quot;competitively&quot; completing a Sudoku  grid over a morning coffee during lockdown, seeing who could finish it first. We are still doing so every day!<p>The concept is simple - You &#x27;start&#x27; a game, and send the link to a friend - this generates your grid ready to be played.  Once your opponent opens the link you start the game at the press of a button. Whilst you play you can see the other player&#x27;s progress across the top. It&#x27;s not limited to just two players, so you can play against multiple opponents at once. You can also just play a timed game yourself, if you wish.<p>At the moment the grids are completed head-to-head in real time, and the winner is the first to finish. A future version will allow your opponents to play against a recorded version of your game at a later time, with the winner being whoever finishes it in the quickest time.<p>The tech stack:<p>- Vue.js 3 &#x2F; Ionic Framework on the font end<p>- Python &#x2F; FastAPI &#x2F; Redis on the backend via websockets<p>By using Ionic the plan is to build &quot;native&quot; apps for mobile with additional features, one day...",
