      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;m a SWE working at one of the big tech co. and I&#x27;m based in London. It&#x27;s possibly the same in SV, but in London the amount of money you earn at big tech co is easily 2x if it&#x27;s not 3x in comparison to startups and 99% of those don&#x27;t even do exit &#x2F; IPO so even the little stock option they give is meaningless.<p>To be able to afford some pretty normal things like 3 bed flat or ok-ish car, I have to work at FAANG or Hedge fund. That said recently I started finding it hard to convince myself in mission and the way those companies work. For the one I&#x27;m working and I can potentially move .<p>Like,<p>- Is Twitter really a good place for having conversation? Is it ever going to grow from where it has been for the last 5 years?\n- Does Facebook&#x27;s mission make sense anymore? With Apple changes and more to come, is their business model still ok?\n- Although the company do well, do I want to join to a company which is well known with its PIP culture? (Amazon)\n- Do I really want to put all my identity aside and join Apple and don&#x27;t do anything other than Apple? (They are way to strict on this side project thing)<p>So on and so fort. Since those companies under the spotlight I also noticed that even following the news about your company becomes tiring after some time.<p>How do you feel? Maybe I&#x27;m putting too much meaning into this work thing.",
