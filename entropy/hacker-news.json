      "text": "Please Excuse the title. I need some perspective.<p>Early Last year I was planning to buy a house in Southern California but ended up taking a job in the Bay Area and moving instead.<p>Kind of kicking myself for not pulling the trigger on a sub 1m house at &lt;3%. I could have just rented it out.<p>Instead I’m in the Bay Area paying in rent what my entire mortgage + taxes would have been while my downpayment money (&gt;200k) just erodes due to inflation- which is accentuated in housing.<p>Now I feel like I’ve missed an opportunity of a lifetime. Housing is much higher across the board and the Bay Area is just nuts.<p>If I was to buy here With a reasonable commute then I’m looking at 1.5m on the lower end for a 3 bedroom (I have a family). Which I can’t (reasonably) pull off at these rates.<p>I make more money than I did but a good portion of that is equity which hasn’t done well. My base income excluding equity is 190k and I’m priced out.<p>I made over $300k last year (it will likely be less than 300k this year due to equity drop) but I’m just as worried about our future as ever.<p>Part of me wonders if I should just buy further away as I just go into work a couple times a week or even go perm remote and buy something for cheaper a lot further away (or even move back).<p>One (of several) downside to living further away is access to career opportunities that are concentrated here. Maybe that’s over valued at this point with the shift to remote work.<p>Or I just put off home ownership for at least the next 5 years. Invest the cash in an index and focus on my career.<p>But I’m only getting older and have a family to support and want to provide stability and security. Housing is a hedge against ever increasing rents so despite the downsides should I just buy what I can and just move.<p>I’m so confused and think about this constantly. Would appreciate perspective.<p>Hope I don’t get flamed. I do feel like I have trouble with perspective and seeing a therapist.",
