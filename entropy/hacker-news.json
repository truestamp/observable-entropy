      "text": "In recent years it seemed to me like C# has become the cleanest choice among the mainstream languages one encounters in local job ads, etc. As someone who has used a lot of different languages I&#x27;m wondering what the best path is to getting a sense of being a C# developer. I would appreciate it if anyone is interested in answering some of my questions like: If you switched to C# what resources did you use (would the same resources still be appropriate today), what IDE, how would you categorize the type of projects you&#x27;ve worked on in industry in C#? If your background was not on windows, did you fully transition over and how did the transition go?",
