Or at least increase your odds?<p>I ask because I&#x27;ve been burned a couple times with people who seemed great, including someone with a reputation for building culture, only to discover they were terrible to work for, and then you&#x27;re in the wrong job. And from my conversations and answers to my questions, I was excited to work for these people.<p>I know we can&#x27;t guard against people outright lying, but beyond that, if you can&#x27;t find someone who&#x27;s worked for them and will give you the unvarnished truth, what are other things people can do when considering working for someone?<p>Or is this ultimately just a risk one has to take?",
