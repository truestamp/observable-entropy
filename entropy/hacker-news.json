We realise an MLOPs system could be a major upgrade for the team. Is it worth-it to purchase subscription for MLOPs platform from a third party? Or is it more resource efficient to hire Data engineers and software developers to build bespoke MLOPs systems in-house? Are there any free tools that can be leveraged upon to build the MLOPs system by data scientists themselves?",
