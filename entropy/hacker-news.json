      "text": "What&#x27;s the best way to get a SPA up and running quickly if you generally dislike the unholy trinity of html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js and the endless frameworks to manage and combine them?<p>Now that Elm-UI appears to be dead, is there anything else that would allow me to just compose code? Is Flutter&#x27;s web app support fleshed out enough? Blazor &#x2F; Bolero seem good except for shipping the entire .Net runtime to the browser as WASM.<p>Are any of the Rust -&gt; WASM projects mature enough to provide a pleasant and quick developer experience?<p>I&#x27;m asking because many of my side projects stall out when I get to coding a front-end; I lose the passion as I don&#x27;t find coding for the browser enjoyable regardless of the frameworks I have tried. Maybe there is a tool &#x2F; language &#x2F; framework out there that I am missing.",
