      "text": "I was frustrated with the state of tooling for working with icons on the web. You&#x27;re either forced to serve gigantic font files with more icons than you could possibly need, or you have to customize your fonts in a browser-based tool.<p>I wanted a CLI program with a simple configuration format, so that I could integrate it with my static site generator build process and version control.<p>I built fontite to fulfill that need. The linked page demonstrates how you might use it to combine icons from 7 different WOFF2 and SVG sources, and only require about 4kB to serve all of them, with no JS required!<p>I now use this on my personal website [1] and I&#x27;m very happy with it. If you&#x27;re curious, there&#x27;s more information on the GitLab repo [2] and I wrote up a summary of the making process [3] as well.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some smaller, faster websites using this tool!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antonok.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antonok.com</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;antonok&#x2F;fontite\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;antonok&#x2F;fontite</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antonok.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;fontite\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antonok.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;fontite</a>",
