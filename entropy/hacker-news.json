      "text": "I think there a few notable similarities between a declarative language like SQL,\nand the problem&#x2F;solution Github&#x27;s Copilot is trying to address.<p>Copilot tries to guess what you want to do, and suggests an implementation for it.<p>In SQL, you explain what you want to do, and the query planner automatically finds a solution to the problem, and returns a result.<p>The important difference is Copilot has to guess your intentions,\nwhereas with SQL, the programmers specify exactly what they want to do\nin a precise way.<p>Much of the auto-generated code Copilot spits out for imperative languages,\nis simply not there at all, in declarative languages like SQL,\nsince you only have to write what you want to do,\nand no code at all on how to actually implement it.<p>My point is, maybe instead of Copilot, we could try to make our programming languages,\nfuture and present, more declarative, to reduce the need to auto-generate code.",
