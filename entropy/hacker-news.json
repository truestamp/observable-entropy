      "text": "I&#x27;m a big fan of my stovetop moka pot, but it doesn&#x27;t quite produce espresso-machine quality brew. Lever espresso machines look interesting, but I&#x27;m unsure how they work in practice.<p>- Is the quality actually comparable to a half-decent espresso machine?<p>- Are they as indestructible as they look? I&#x27;d rather not buy something which suffers from metal fatigue in a few months.<p>- Are they as easy to clean as they seem? Having something like three moving parts seems like it should be basically trivial to keep clean, even in an office with tens of users.",

      "text": "All mail clients suck. It seems every single one needs a lot of configuration effort to have a decent experience, most of them have really slow search, and several of them have unrecoverably deleted messages seemingly at random. I&#x27;m tempted to try managing my email using Git, one file per email. It&#x27;ll be super fast and reliable, and I won&#x27;t have to ever worry about losing my emails after they are safely copied to several separate devices. Is this feasible? Specifically:<p>- Is there any decent software to save all messages from the IMAP server to one file per message on a regular basis? They&#x27;d have to at least have some sensible filenames, like date + subject.<p>- Are there any Linux and Android clients which will read files from such a folder? I don&#x27;t mind to `adb push` the repository if necessary, but if I have to read them using a text editor that&#x27;ll be a blocker.",
