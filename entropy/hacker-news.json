To my surprise, I just can&#x27;t see the colors of the syntax highlighting. I manage to guess they are there, but I don&#x27;t actually see them as clearly as the Monokai theme.<p>I&#x27;m not colorblind (but my father is), so I don&#x27;t really understand why.<p>Do you have the same experience?<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oVDbu8lhqAA (french)",

      "text": "I am very bullish on open-source and platform based approach to build SaaS products. Recently, I&#x27;ve seen ToolJet, Hoppscotch, RayCast executing it very well.<p>Been using OSS products for the past few years for all the cloud-infra related needs and feel that great products can be built this way (along with giving back to the community).<p>- How well has this worked for you if you tried this approach  at your startup?<p>- What are the things that should be taken into consideration with this approach? (delayed revenue, free to paid conversion etc.)<p>- Is there any &quot;right&quot; way to try this approach? (like build a product for 1-2 years then focus on platform etc.)<p>I am building a product in B2B SaaS (along the lines of enterprise search and productivity) but there are many older, not-so-good and sales-led players in that domain.",
