      "text": "Hi, guys! I just made a google sheet that helps to track your investment portfolio ( largely based on the other&#x27;s work) and to plan for your FIRE( financial freedom, retire early). Please visit the google sheet and make a copy of it.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1DEg4hOy-rJ632BBFZhmLKmJ1miVR2YHIgf7BQeiXp98&#x2F;edit#gid=1321282994<p>A majority of credit goes to Rob Berger who created the investment tracking tool in the first place. Here&#x27;s the link that shows his instructions:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robberger.com&#x2F;investment-tracking-spreadsheet&#x2F;.<p>Please let me know your feedback.",
