      "text": "I am contracted by a major financial services firm to refactor an analytical model used for revenue forecasting to PySpark executing on a AWS EMR cluster.<p>The project&#x27;s current status is documented[0].<p>The client&#x27;s team responsible for operationalization was successful in refactoring another analytical model into Python&#x2F;pandas.  The current model execution time for a 5 year scenario is ~17 hours.  Most of that time is\nspent executing poorly crafted Oracle SQL queries drawing millions of rows into the analytical run-time for, sorting, aggregation, discarding, merging, and spliting tasks.<p>In order to  constrain this exeuction time, final input is a sample of ~1.8M rows from  a loan portfolio of ~81M  records.<p>The client is concerned about performance and believes PySpark is the preferred target language.<p>I have been on this project for just one month, but I contracted previously at the same firm on a six months  to refactor another model into Python&#x2F;pandas.  That project was successful, mainly due to the team leader&#x27;s rigor for meeting milestones and ability to remove blockers for the team.<p>I recently discussed these projects with @Travis Oliphant who had some interesting ideas on Python-based frameworks to overcome issues for processing out-of-core dataframes.  We discussed the frameworks Dask[1], Coiled.io, commercial Dask support[2], Ray[3], Modin, commercial support for Ray[4].<p>Others discussed were, Databricks[5], bodo.ai[6], Voltron Data[7], and AtScale[8]. On Reddit, the \ncommentary for Snowflake was very positive[9].<p>Easing maintenence burdens to keep the model in production and devising new scenarios (e.g. Covid-19 effects on forebarance requests) are requirements.  Its shelf-life is years, making maintainability a major consideration.<p>What have others experienced in scaling out for teams familiar with Python&#x2F;pandas for feature engineering tasks?<p>Is PySpark a dead-end libray in the Python ecosystem?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pythonforsasusers.com&#x2F;project_summary&#x2F;current_project_status.html<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dask.org&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coiled.io&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ray.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;ray-0.4.0&#x2F;pandas_on_ray.html<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modin.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.databricks.com&#x2F;languages&#x2F;pandas-spark.html (which points to Apache&#x27;s Pandas API on Spark)<p>[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bodo.ai&#x2F;<p>[7] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wesmckinney.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;from-ursa-to-voltrondata&#x2F;<p>[8] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atscale.com&#x2F;autonomous-data-engineering&#x2F;<p>[9] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;dataengineering&#x2F;comments&#x2F;r893rw&#x2F;why_is_snowflake_so_popular&#x2F;",
