It&#x27;s like isort, but for the rest of the file.<p>It&#x27;s starting to get a bit of momentum.  We have users across a few different companies and some consistent contributors (thank you, in particular, jgberry).  We&#x27;re reaching a point of stability, and would like to gather some final feedback before hitting the big 1.0.",
