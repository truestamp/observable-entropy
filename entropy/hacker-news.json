      "text": "There are different factors to consider when investing in a crypto project such as market cap, price volatility, etc. Many sources already provide this information, but what if you want to know about a project’s development activity and the people behind it? Your only option is to dig into Github, but Github is not optimized for this job. That is why we started <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coincode.live\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coincode.live</a>.<p>Coincide Live is a perfect tool for non-technical investors to quickly gain insight into the development and technical information of crypto projects. We are launching the Alpha version of the product that provides the following information:<p>- project observability (how transparent a project is)\n - development activity rate over the different periods (last week, last month,...)\n - project details\n - top contributors\n - open and closed issues on Github\n - …<p>We are currently monitoring over 1000 crypto projects from Github and Gitlab and are planning to expand this number to cover almost all known crypto projects.<p>Our 3-6 month goals are:\n - Finding correlations between a crypto project development activity and its price history to \n - facilitate future price prediction (currently work in progress)\n - RESTFul&#x2F;GraphQL API for developers\n - Allow crypto project owners to create their own profiles and list their coins on our website\n - Allow crypto project owners to only promote repositories and branches they want to and not \n   everything\n - Allow project contributors&#x2F;developers to create their own profiles on our website.\n - Connecting blockchain developers with proven experience to the blockchain recruitment network<p>Your feedback will be most welcome, you can reach out to us at the following links:\nTwitter: @coincode_live\nTelegram: @coincodelive\nEmail: info@coincode.live",
