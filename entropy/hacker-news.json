We are doing so using the power of NFC tags combined with the uniqueness of NFTs.<p>I&#x27;ve made a prototype. You can check it out on the website mentioned above or here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fHCxnHlQIjk<p>I would like to know the best possible way of reaching out to big footwear brands for demonstrating them the concept in order to tie-up with them.<p>Let me know if you have any other suggestions&#x2F;feedback as well.<p>Peace\nHammad Nasir",
