      "text": "Hi, fellow developers who hate CSS and designing,<p>I worked on a photo-sharing app as my side hustle using React Js. I want to allow the photo owners to view the statistics and analytical data of every photo they share. However, building the analytic dashboard from scratch is hard as I rather spend my time building my product. That is why I came out with this idea to solve this problem that fellow makers might face. Since this is the MVP, I decided to make the tool easy and simple to use by having only 3 steps :<p>1. Add your Webhook API.<p>2. Edit the charts.<p>3. Embed the charts.<p>Hope you guys find it useful! Any feedback and tips are sincerely appreciated as this is my first time launching a web app to the public.",
