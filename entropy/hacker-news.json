      "text": "I follow systemd-networkd development in order to utilise advanced functionality as it lands, as well as proposing or following other issues that provide desirable functionality.<p>Recently I was following issue #17380 [0] &quot;No router advertisements sent out over wireguard link&quot; which resulted in PR #21692 [1] &quot;network: wireguard: allow to start ndisc or radv&quot;.<p>Shortly after the issue was closed Jason Donenfeld (alias zx2c4 - author of Wireguard) added a comment [2]:<p>&quot;Please revert this. WireGuard does not work with LLv6 by design.&quot;<p>As a strong proponent and designer&#x2F;developer&#x2F;operator of IPv6-only networks and services I was unpleasantly surprised by this comment since we rely on IPv6 link-local functionality and also use Wireguard extensively including with link-local addresses and try to ensure everything we deploy is conformant with industry standards to ensure inter-operability.<p>I thought I may have misunderstood the IPv6 standards from RFC4291 &quot;IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture&quot; section 2.1 &quot;Addressing Model&quot; [3] which says:<p>&quot;All interfaces are required to have at least one Link-Local unicast address (see Section 2.8 for additional required addresses).&quot;<p>After mentioning this in the issue zx2c4 replied with:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m aware of that text. It doesn&#x27;t change the fact that this isn&#x27;t how WireGuard works.&quot;<p>In my mind point-to-point tunnels like Wireguard are closely aligned with link-local addressing so this was somewhat of a surprise!<p>Which leaves us with a dilemma - if we can&#x27;t rely on standard IPv6 link-local behaviour on Wireguard links what similar tunnelling options should we consider? I did recently reconsider IPSec since it was originally designed as part of IPv6 although ended up being an optional extra and can be much more complex to manage.<p>What alternatives would the Linux-focused network professionals recommend ?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;issues&#x2F;17380<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;pull&#x2F;21692<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;issues&#x2F;17380#issuecomment-1008323004<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4291#section-2.1",
