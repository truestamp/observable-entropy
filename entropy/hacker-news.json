      "text": "This short post is for everyone who does not know how to code, or who is thinking about giving up on their attempt because it is too difficult or they may have reached a plateau.<p>Everyone should learn how to code.<p>A friend of mine, Afshin, told me years ago Programming is like Mathematics. No one expects me to solve complex problems, know trigonometry, or even pre-calculus. Instead, I was just expected to know some Arithmetic. Because that is what most people need on a day to day basis. He simply believed most people have a better life because they understand how basic math works. &quot;All you need is to know you have 10 dollars, this item cost 8 dollars, and upon purchase you should get 2 dollars in change. This will save you a lot of headache in life. Programming is the same.&quot;<p>We do not expected everyone who learns to read and write to become a fine journalist or a skilled writer or to even understand everything they read. Same with programming, not everyone needs to become an engineer. Buut they just need to know enough to empower them. A marketing analyst who knows a little bit of HTML coding is going to benefit. A secretary who knows a little bit of javascript is going to benefit. A web designer who understands SQL queries is going to benefit.  A manager who understands some programming will certainly be more relaxed on set deadlines.<p>So if you find yourself wanting to quit because you are not as skilled as 99% of the engineers you meet, remember you also are less skilled than 99% of journalists, writers, mathematicians, doctors, yet you know a little bit of Math, you know how to read, you understand how your body works, and all this elevates you.<p>Learn how to code. Nothing is too small.",
