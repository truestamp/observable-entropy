If you have a few minutes, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts.<p>I have a brief survey here -- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLScJRzenKFf5GyrEo2tVlAEibwNJGggHD0Z0iBahhzMgmy5vTw&#x2F;viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.1573644412=Hacker+News -- but also would appreciate any comments below.",
