      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I just wanted to show the progress on my little (maybe useless) side project called tone[1] to get some qualified feedback.<p>tone is a cross plattform command line audio tagger deployed as a single static binary without dependencies, so a wget should be enough to install on any platform (seems not to work on M1 Macs atm... if someone can help here I would really appreciate it).<p><pre><code>  Features:\n  - Supports most common formats (mp3, m4a, flac, ape, etc.)\n  - Most common AND custom metadata fields\n  - Chapter support\n  - Embeddable pictures\n  - Hackable (write your own taggers with scripting language)\n</code></pre>\nThanks and have fun.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sandreas&#x2F;tone",
