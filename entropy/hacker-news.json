      "text": "I work for a small&#x2F;medium (~10-15 employees) non-profit agency where our employees are expected to visit up to 30 clients per month to fulfill a court-imposed requirement for us to see them within that timeframe.<p>There are a number of paid services that offer to plan efficient routes given a number of inputs, and some free ones, but the free services I have seen are quite limited (e.g.: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planner.myrouteonline.com&#x2F; does not allow you to disallow usage of toll roads).<p>We reimburse employees for their mileage but in an effort to reduce reimbursement and miles driven, we would like to provide employees with access to a system that just lets them plug in the addresses and get a fairly optimized route.<p>There is the Google Maps TSP Solver \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tzmartin&#x2F;Google-Maps-TSP-Solver but this looks like it requires a Maps API Key, which is expensive on its own, however...<p>Google offers a &quot;Google for Nonprofits&quot; account which, I believe, offers a monthly credit of about $200-$250 for the Maps API.<p>I am interested in setting this up for our nonprofit but first wanted to check with HN to see if anyone has done something like this before. I am not a programmer and would be wading into this basically blind, so any insight from someone who has been in the same boat would be highly illustrative.<p>Thank you!",
