      "text": "I realize this topic has been discussed numerous times, but after some research I found about 50 different &quot;theories&quot; on how it is supposed to work.<p>As a developer and electronic engineer, it deeply frustrate me to have no good understanding of it. I am quite sure that the actual protocol and electrical details are simple, but because everybody comes with their own theory, navigating google results is really hard.<p>Long story short, I built a new threadripper workstation, and none of the gazillion of USB port will charge my One Plus 5T phone.<p>I tried all the the A-C ports with different cables (aren&#x27;t A port just 4 contacts? what can be in the cable, resistors?...). I also tried C-C and it doesn&#x27;t charge either.<p>So, two questions:<p>- Is there a good, technically precise and right explanation of the whole situation? I tried reading the USB standard, but it would take days to extract a proper understanding of it.\n- In there an adapter or something I can use on USB-C port of my workstation to provide a &quot;charge port&quot; for my phone which seems to require some voodoo magic to charge?<p>I am posting on HN because it has a lot of visibility, and I hope this post might become a beacon of hope in the USB situation (this part is very pretentious, but HN did surprise me quite many times).",
