Are there any unexpected consequences of doing this? I would like to keep things as simple as possible.<p>I&#x27;m considering just having one alias for personal&#x2F;professional correspondence, one alias for &quot;trusted&quot; accounts (i.e. services that I don&#x27;t think are likely to sell&#x2F;leak my email address to spammers), and one alias for less trusted accounts.<p>What do you guys use&#x2F;recommend?",
