      "text": "Hi everyone,<p>I and my wife are thinking about starting a web design company, which would target smaller businesses. We would provide custom web and mobile app designs, custom website development, but I was also thinking about providing simple web hosting as well (for small wordpress sites or something similar).<p>She is great with digital arts and recently started learning web design and UX and she loves it. I&#x27;m currently working at a FAANG as a software engineer, but I&#x27;m getting more and more bored every day.<p>However, we are a bit worried whether it is even worth starting a business like this nowadays, because there are countless businesses providing the same services, and I&#x27;m not sure if we could get enough clients. Also I&#x27;ve done some research, and found many landing page and website builder tools, some of them are even free.<p>Is there anything that could make us stand out from the crowd? Is there anything missing in this web design&#x2F;development space? What could we do to siphon some clients from big web design&#x2F;development&#x2F;hosting companies? (other than being extra cheap)",
