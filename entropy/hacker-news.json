      "text": "What would typescript look like if it were freed from the shackles of JavaScript? Could it be a first class language compiled to machine code, .NET IL, or wasm, with runtime type checking, and cleaner and less bloated?<p>Are there any forks of Typescript (or TypeScript-like languages) exploring these ideas?<p>Rationale for Question:\nAfter using TypeScript for some years, I find C#, as good a language as it is, fairly clunky. C# lacks many things that make TypeScript so expressive: straightforward first-class functions and union types, for example. I think my ideal language would be something that marries the best parts of C# and TypeScript.",
