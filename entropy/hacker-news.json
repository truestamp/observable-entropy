I used Apple ID and I did hide my email, so the resulting email is something like:\n `xyz4rt5uiosshpv@privaterelay.appleid.com` (not the real one)<p>I wonder if that&#x27;s what flagged the account, but as usual in these cases, there&#x27;s nothing the support team will tell me or do to help (which I understand, they have their hands tied by internal policies)<p>So, I was wondering, had anyone else here had a similar issue?
