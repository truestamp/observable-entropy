      "text": "When I use Chrome&#x2F;Chromium on GNU&#x2F;Linux, I am able to focus the bookmarks bar by pressing either Alt+Shift+B or Ctrl+Shift+B or something similar.<p>It puts focus on the first item, which I can immediately activate with Enter (or is it spacebar?) or alternatively I can tab to the next one.<p>This is great for activating bookmarklets, although they&#x27;re slightly crippled by only working on pages which are allowed JS.<p>However, on Mac, there seems to be no such shortcut. No matter how much I&#x27;ve googled or tried different combinations of all the different meta keys with B, none seem to work.<p>Does anyone know if there is such a thing?",
