      "text": "I have this idea about a coin that would help a historically marginalized people. Aa to be exact and this coin would have 2 modes depending on where if was being held and the value of the coin would change depending on who would have it and how many were being held and where I’m trying to be real vague about the actual workings of this coin but my question is would you get behind a coin that was catering or meant for him to help historically marginalized people and I happen to be the same race let’s just say “BLM” coin. No because I’m associated with BLM in anyway but just because it might get people thinking the right way. And please this is just a radical idea and I don’t know what to do with it and I decided you know what let’s see what some of the possibly brightest minds around think if anybody’s interested in helping me get this off the ground just send me a message",
