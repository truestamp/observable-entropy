      "text": "A lot of recent evidence points to Facebook and other social media platforms as being addictive, divisive, misinformation-ridden, and destructive to society and democracy. I personally tend to avoid them as I don&#x27;t feel they add much to my life.<p>I&#x27;m considering advertising a side project on Facebook. But - ad money is what fuels this particular beast, and pays the generous salaries of those keeping it running. So maybe the ethical thing is to not supply any additional dollars, however small, and bid up the value of the captive attention of their user base?<p>Not that my ad purchases would matter statistically, and I should be wary of getting on a high horse here. And there are many other ways to make a positive difference to the social media dilemma - better regulation, disciplined use as a user, etc.<p>Anyway, curious what others here think about the ethics of purchasing social media ads.",
