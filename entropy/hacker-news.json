      "text": "https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rodgarrison&#x2F;PGM-index was previously posted to HN. However, to leverage PGM for keys that are strings or blobs (arrays of unsigned bytes) one needs a map from the key as an array of bytes to some integral type. What are the options here?<p>An order preserving hash is such that if keys k0&lt;=k1 then hash(k0)&lt;=hash(k1).<p>As far as I can tell the broad outline of options include:<p>* naive options like put all strings in a std map and give the index to the entry as the hash value<p>* Some variation of converting the key into a bitstream, maybe with compression hoping to get into a 64-256 bit range.<p>* Putting the keys into a trie or BST and converting the path through the structure to the key into a bitstream which becomes an int.<p>* An actual order preserving hash e.g. something like this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DominikHorn&#x2F;exotic-hashing&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;include&#x2F;omphf<p>Does anybody know better? An important property (and relaxation) is that all the strings need may not be known ahead of time. So the hash need not be minimal.",
