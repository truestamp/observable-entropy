      "text": "Hey HN  My name is Johannes and I&#x27;m the co-founder of NFTPort (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftport.xyz&#x2F;), which is the Stripe for NFTs - a one-stop, simple and developer-friendly NFT infrastructure &amp; APIs which enables developers to bring their NFT applications to market in hours instead of months.<p>I&#x27;ve always wanted to build NFT &amp; blockchain applications but for a long-time I was held back by its sheer complexity. That&#x27;s why we decided to build the most simplest NFT creation (i.e. minting) API for developers: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nftport.xyz&#x2F;docs&#x2F;nftport&#x2F;ZG9jOjE3NDI3MDc3-minting-quickstart<p>For NFTs, art and collectibles were just the beginning. You can now literally turn anything into an NFT - the only limit is your imagination. Once you have that  moment, you can:<p>1. Hack &amp; bring your NFT project to life in record time<p>2. Test new NFT product ideas without learning smart contract development<p>3. Attract the existing NFT user base to your application<p>4. Automate NFT minting and selling from your app to earn moneyz<p>5. Market your merch directly to high value NFT holders by dropping your NFTs to their wallet<p>It&#x27;s free, zero blockchain experience needed, no maintenance and takes only 120 seconds:<p>1. No ETH necessary and no need to spend money. You can mint anything as NFT for free and green on Polygon, a layer 2 solution built on top of Ethereum<p>2. No learning curve i.e. you don&#x27;t have to be Vitalik Buterin to get started. You don&#x27;t need to learn Solidity, Web3.js or any other complicated blockchain tech. If you know how to use a simple REST API, you can turn anything into an NFT in less than 120 seconds<p>3. Zero maintenance: No need to write and deploy a solidity contract. No need to setup and manage your own complex infrastructure&#x2F;backend. It&#x27;s all taken care for you automatically<p>About us:<p>Our mission is to empower developers to break up today&#x27;s data monopolies and make the Internet ownable by citizens. Built by a team of ex-NATO, Nvidia &amp; Monese and backed by the Co-Founders of Polygon, Skype &amp; Wise.<p>We would love to hear your thoughts, questions, concerns, or ideas about what we’re building. As well, if you have ever wanted to build NFT applications but have struggled with it, then how did you overcome it?",
