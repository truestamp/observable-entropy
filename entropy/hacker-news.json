I like my job a lot, but there are a lot of subjects that I don&#x27;t encounter at my job, like complex data structures, compiler development, and other topics that are discusses heavily in college, but not used in most careers.<p>I don&#x27;t plan on going back to school, and I enjoy my job, but what are some good ways to be both exposed to new ideas, as well as dive deeper into them? Learning is something that I really enjoy and makes me feel rewarded, but it&#x27;s not as straight forward now as it was when I was in school.<p>Optimally, I&#x27;d have a reference for the information, and then work on projects to solidify the knowledge. I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit, especially for a good book.",
