      "text": "When working on new products, it is often the case that most of the frontend work that needs to be done has a direct dependency on the backend functionality that it will be integrating with. But BE work takes time, obviously. During that time, I&#x27;ve found that FE engineers are often looking for work as they wait for the BE functionality to be delivered. Do you have suggestions for how to deal with this? Do you stagger work so that BE is ahead of FE so that FE always has stuff to work on? Do you decide on an API in place first even if it doesn&#x27;t function so that FE can simply plug in with that API even if they need to use dummy&#x2F;mock data for the time being?<p>Appreciate any thoughts.",
