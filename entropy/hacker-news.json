      "text": "I&#x27;m a Swiss citizen, 38-years old. I&#x27;ve been based out of Southeast Asia for close to ten years. During this time, I&#x27;ve mostly survived on past savings and odd online jobs. However, for various reasons, I&#x27;m no longer able to stay here and have to return to Switzerland.\nI have little financial resources left, so I need a job fast. I will do anything within my capabilities. In the (distant) past, I worked in IT, but my tasks were mostly confined to simple code maintenance &amp; bug fixing. I also dabbled with Ruby on Rails during my free-time. That said, I didn&#x27;t touch code in several years. However, I would be totally willing to try and get back into it, even at minimal pay. I would also consider related jobs, like IT support or DevOps.\nIf anyone has any pointers or tips, that would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks\nSteve",

      "text": "Hi Everyone,\nI&#x27;m Shazeb, and currently working as a penetration tester and I made this pwnremote Jobs website to help people find a remote job in cybersecurity.<p>Problem: \nMy current job is fully remote and, now I want to change the job, but I couldn&#x27;t find any good platforms to find a proper remote job for the cybersecurity.<p>Solution:\nSo, I&#x27;ve created this website(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pwnremote.com) because I’ve seen many people, including myself, Who want to apply for jobs for remote work, but there is no platform for cybersecurity jobs and also, if you google also, there are not many results. That is why now, I’ve created this dedicated place that is only focused on Cyber Security Jobs. We want to protect the internet from anywhere in the world.<p>Also, I know this is not a perfect website, but please be nice and give me a feedback, so i can learn and improve my website.<p>Thanks,\nShazeb",
