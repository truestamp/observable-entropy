      "text": "Hello everyone, I wanted to ask you how do you learn to build complex web apps by just using javascript? It seems to be a common thing to complain in HN about bloated websites with a heavy use of js and frameworks, for example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29703546.<p>Every time I try to build anything more complex than a weather app, my codebase becomes a mess. I&#x27;m still very new to software development and I still have a lot to learn, so maybe that&#x27;s part of the problem. How do you manage your app state, how do you get back your state after a crash or a refresh? All these seem difficult to accomplish without a framework.<p>Any good courses, blogs, repos to study in order to learn this? Thank you!",

I increased the limit to 32kB, as I figured it would give a safe margin.<p>Well, it broke again some time this month:<p><pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib.request\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; urllib.request.urlopen(&#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&#x27;).read().index(b&#x27;&lt;title&#x27;)\n    192194\n</code></pre>\nThis seems to be mostly inlined minified Javascript. Why does Youtube do this instead of including scripts that could be cached?",
