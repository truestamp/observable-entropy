One colleague of mine is using the same audio interface and has the same problem on macos. Has anybody else noticed that?<p>Weird thing is that this indicates a system feature or problem, but in Discord &amp; Slack it doesn&#x27;t happen at all. Also the system cannot control the Scarlett Solo&#x27;s microphone volume at all.",
