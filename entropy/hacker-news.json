      "text": "I was listening to BBC&#x27;s global news podcast this morning and was somewhat surprised to hear a reporter describe themselves as a &quot;climate misinformation reporter&quot;.  Seems odd to me.  Is this a new thing?  NYT is hiring for this role https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talkingbiznews.com&#x2F;biz-news-help-wanted&#x2F;ny-times-seeks-misinformation-reporter-on-tech-desk&#x2F;<p>&#x27;This is a beat that intersects with almost every part of the report, including media, politics, health and international, so an ability and willingness to collaborate is essential. A sense of humor is also required&#x27;<p>Not much mention of how a &#x27;misinformation reporter&#x27; is different from a regular journalist.",
