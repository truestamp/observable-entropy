In the past I used Jenkins and a combination of Teamcity and Github actions, is there a consensus on what&#x27;s the simplest&#x2F;most boring technology to use for this? The rest of the techstack is a monorepo of django and a couple of (typescript) next.js apps, a variety of AWS services and I want to avoid pushing the boat out on  stuff that isn&#x27;t a value add but also want to make sure there isn&#x27;t some great alternative that I&#x27;m not aware of.<p>At the moment CD is just me running &quot;eb deploy&quot; every so often which isn&#x27;t great.",
