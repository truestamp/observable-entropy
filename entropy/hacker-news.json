He is sending them videos and images from the war in Ukraine, and nothing won&#x27;t change their minds and conviction that Ukraine needs to be liberated from the Nazis.<p>Now I wonder: Is there any clever way to combat Propaganda in such a situation? How can you establish at least doubt in the other person&#x27;s mind?",
