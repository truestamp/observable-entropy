My main question is: Can I work as a developer and not be under pressure every minute?\n2. If I get hired as a developer, can I have a life outside my work or I&#x27;m gonna have to learn the new hipster framework after work hours for the rest of my life?\n3. Is it worth cutting my salary by 2 days a week to work on open source projects to build up a resume?\n4. I&#x27;m fine learning say, COBOL. Should I go that way?\n5. Am I better off looking for other jobs?\n6. Any advices?<p>P.s I don&#x27;t think I can do paid remote work for foreign countries until I get a second passport since Iran is sanctioned and I probably can&#x27;t have a bank account in western countries.",

      "text": "Hi HN!\nI want to share with you something we&#x27;re working on from some months, Codelia Headless CMS (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeliacms.com&#x2F;). It&#x27;s a content platform based on APIs that makes able to model content without touching any line of code and to deliver omnichannel content from one unique workspace.<p>THE PROBLEM\nThere is a lack of synergy between marketing and development teams while using usual and popular CMSs, they usually need to update the code of a custom web project to add a content model or a content field for example, involving developers. This brings to the lost of working hours and money.<p>THE SOLUTION\nMarketing teams can work on their own way modeling content without touching any line of code and without developers, delivering it on multiple devices at the same time from one unique workspace. Developers can work with any tech stack and without limitations. In this way it&#x27;s possible to save working hours and budget, launching faster.<p>I encourage you to try the free trial (no credit card required), and I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback!",
