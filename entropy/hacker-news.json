I am 2 YOE, so very junior, and I would say that probably 95% of the code I&#x27;ve written ends up getting tossed?<p>That said, this isn&#x27;t to say that I write useless code, it&#x27;s just that very few things I write are used for more than 1-2 months, at which point our team moves onto different things.<p>Curious if you&#x27;ve noticed less code being thrown away as you grow in your career, and if not, what the pattern has been for you.",
