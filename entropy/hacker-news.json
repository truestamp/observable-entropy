My non-tech skills (comms, collab, leading) are one of my strengths and I&#x27;m constantly trying to make them better. I constantly keep feeling that I don&#x27;t know enough tech stuff, there&#x27;s a ridiculous amount to learn and foundational blind spots and holes that keep cropping up.<p>One of the questions I try to ask myself is, if I joined a new team or company, what skills would I need to really help the team succeed quickly and effectively.<p>A lot of ya&#x27;ll have been around the block a lot, and either  been or worked with such folks. Your insights would be super appreciated",
