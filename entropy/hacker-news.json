      "text": "Hi y&#x27;all,<p>I recently read Crypto.com&#x27;s original &quot;On-Chain Market Sizing&quot; publication [1] and I have a question about the methodology.<p>In order to determine the number of wallet-holders on the Bitcoin blockchain, they count the number of deposit addresses connected to various exchanges:<p><pre><code>    Most exchanges use an architecture called “deposit sweeping” to\n    handle crypto deposit inflows. By counting the deposit addresses via\n    on-chain data, we can approximate the number of users for that\n    exchange.\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I did not think that each exchange would use a single deposit address for each user. In the past when I have deposited funds in some exchanges I would get a different address each time. Therefore, wouldn&#x27;t this mean that rather than counting the number of users, this method is more likely counting the number of deposits? Since each user may have several deposits with a single exchange, this may be inflating the projected count of users by anywhere from 2 to 100+ times, depending on the average number of deposits made per user per exchange.<p>The methodology doesn&#x27;t make any attempt to correct for this, and actually goes on to further inflate this value by scaling it by the inverse of the &#x27;deposit rate&#x27;, calculated from one of Crypto.com&#x27;s surveys:<p><pre><code>    By assuming that the number of users on an exchange approximately\n    equals to the number of exchange addresses, we can state our first\n    formula [Formula 1]\n    However, on-chain addresses will only appear once people have\n    performed a deposit &#x2F; withdrawal action, to account for the fact that\n    some people have never deposited into &#x2F; withdrawn from the\n    exchange.\n    To estimate the true number of exchange users, we need to further\n    scale up the number in formula (1): it should be divided by the ratio\n    that people have deposited into an exchange.\n    We calculated the deposit ratio by blended metrics from our internal\n    data, survey data and industry benchmark.\n</code></pre>\nThis assumption that &quot;the number of users on an exchange approximately equals to the number of exchange addresses&quot; feels like a very strong assumption to me, doesn&#x27;t align with my own experience of using exchanges, and can potentially skew the results by an order of magnitude!<p>Can someone with a better understanding of the different exchanges included in this report, and the &#x27;deposit sweeping&#x27; methods and wallet structures used by these exchanges, provide their take on this assumption and the potential for error here?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crypto.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;article?category=data&amp;page=on-chain-market-sizing<p>Thanks!",
