      "text": "I&#x27;m critically demotivated and the only time I get any work done is when I&#x27;m drinking in the cafe across the street from my house. Everything at work is just so incredibly tedious it&#x27;s so hard to actually sit down and get anything done (so much Jira and deployment automation bullshit, I probably spend 2 weeks a year doing anything I would consider actually productive.) I don&#x27;t want anything materially (I have a yacht etc etc) and although I would be much less comfortable I have enough in my 401k that I could live without working. The only reason I stay employed is to afford the things that impress women (cars, large house etc.) I don&#x27;t even use half my house, it&#x27;s probably been months since I&#x27;ve been in half the rooms.<p>I don&#x27;t want to look for a new job either. That&#x27;s so incredibly painful especially since I didn&#x27;t finish my degree (I did all the course work, but I was 20 hours short on community service and between COVID and the semester boundaries the administration decided that I needed to retake a bunch of liberal arts classes which had been rearranged and I hated the first time I took and passed them.)<p>I feel like if I don&#x27;t change something I&#x27;m eventually going to get fired for under performing which is something I&#x27;d like to avoid. I&#x27;m wondering if you guys have any suggestions&#x2F;coping mechanisms other than just drinking to get through it all.",
