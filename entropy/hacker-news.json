      "text": "I made a tool for myself to act as a filter for recruiter messages.<p>I was tired of getting vague messages and doing the typical messaging back and forth only to hear the salary was too low or the job didn&#x27;t have remote.<p>The tool lets you create a form with a selection of only the filters you want on there.\nYou give a unique link to recruiters that will take them to the your form\nThey can fill in your form (or not)\nIf their responses pass your filters you&#x27;ll get an email. If their responses fail your filters, the recruiter gets an email saying so, so they know not to bother you again.<p>The idea is that recruiters can never see your filter values<p>You can rate limit individual recruiter submissions per day (they have to log in to submit)<p>Keen for any feedback thanks!<p>I&#x27;m especially keen for any feedback from recruiters if you do decide to use it :)<p>cheers,\ndar",
