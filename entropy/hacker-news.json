      "text": "I&#x27;m self learning Computer Science basics (through Berkeley courses, that are CS61A for Programming, CS61B for Data Structures and CS61C for Computer Architecture). After that I would like to specialize but have no idea of what, with the ultimate goal of finding a job. Remotely, if that is possible for a junior, Covid situation might help here. I&#x27;m from a 3rd world country, living in Europe, but planning to go back home, the jobs do not have to pay extremely well as long as it&#x27;s remote. So what kind of job is the most open to self learner in this industry? Web development is what everyone is talking about, but is that really it? How do I maximize my chance? Also, does grinding Leetcode like website works as proofs of knowledge? If anyone has been in a similar situation, please reach out, it would make my day to be able to chat.",
