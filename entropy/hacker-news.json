Owning a custom piece of beautifully crafted equipment is delightful!<p>However if you own one of the loud ones and want to be considerate to your coworkers, I implore you to not use them at the office. The sound is so loud it pierces through noise cancelling headphones, and it&#x27;s not fun to have to blast music all day just to cover up the sounds of typing.<p>There are some options if you want a quieter mechanical keyboard (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronicshub.org&#x2F;best-quiet-mechanical-keyboards&#x2F;) or you can get the o-rings to dampen the sound of the switches on your current model (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.ca&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00K73IE1C).<p>Truly not trying to be a dick writing this, I really get the excitement!
