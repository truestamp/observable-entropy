      "text": "Most of us see ourselves as pretty tech-savvy. But have you ever fallen to a phishing attempt? Or came close to falling for a scam? Or did one of your relatives fall victim to a phishing attempt?<p>I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have not been a victim of phishing. The closest was a text message phishing attempt.<p>I received a text message saying I had missed a parcel delivery and to re-arrange delivery and pay a re-delivery charge. I almost fell for it because I <i>was</i> expecting a parcel delivery on that day. Text messages use shortened URLs that hide their full URL, but when I clicked the URL in the text message the website that opened in my mobile browser was a convincing reproduction of a delivery company. Luckily, I realised this was a phishing attempt when I looked at the URL. (Some mobile browsers hide the URL until you scroll up the page.)<p>On subsequent occasions I received similar text messages but I knew immediately they were fake because I wasn&#x27;t expecting any parcel deliveries. Given that many people expect parcel deliveries regularly, I suspect some users fall for this scam when the fake text message coincidences with an actual delivery. I also wonder how my mobile number managed to get on to some scammer&#x27;s list of phone numbers and where else it’s being circulating.<p>So, have you ever fallen to a phishing attempt? Or came close to falling for a scam? Or did one of your relatives fall victim to a phishing attempt?",
