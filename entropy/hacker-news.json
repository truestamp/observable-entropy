      "text": "The modern scientific publishing industry charges seemingly exorbitant subscription (or author) fees, given its reliance on unpaid academics for not only the research itself, but also editors, board members, and peer reviewers. The Journal of Machine Learning Research seems to provide evidence that this service can be provided for a fraction of the cost (&lt;$10&#x2F;article) at least in some circumstances; on the other hand, the non-profit PLOS network still charges $1339&#x2F;article for open-access publication.\nCould we do better, at least for some larger segment of the market than is currently served by no-fee open-access journals?\nWhat services would have to be provided? How much would that actually cost, in money, volunteer hours, or compute resources?",
