      "text": "I am trying to understand how to better negotiate equity grants after reading some articles that explore changes to compensation practices, so I wanted to ask the community about their experiences:<p>- Company stage? Seed, Series A, B, ..., D, etc.\n- How was it explained to you? Terms, requirements for grant, communicated verbally or written, etc.\n- If you have experience as founder, executive, or equivalent role in trying to convince the board to approve an equity refresher program, how did it go?
