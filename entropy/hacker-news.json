      "text": "I have 15 years of experience doing backend-focused, full-stack web development. I do lots of ops work at my current job (CI setup, DB provisioning, Server Setup, Load Balancers, Monitoring). However I realize there is always a LOT more to learn when it comes to automating, monitoring and scaling infrastructure. Current cloud experience is in AWS.<p>Is there a certification I can work towards to make myself a competitive candidate for a DevOps&#x2F; DevOps Engineer position? Should I just get certified by GCP &#x2F; AWS?<p>Currently making around 250k. I am hoping to make around 300k a year (CA is expensive :( ), please let me know if there is a related position that will help me get to that comp. E.g. should I focus more towards devsecops, etc.<p>Considering this program: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;professionalprograms.mit.edu&#x2F;online-program-cloud-devops-continuous-transformation&#x2F;<p>Thank you!!",
