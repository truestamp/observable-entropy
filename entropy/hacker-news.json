      "text": "To my utter shame, I must admit that when I accepted the job offer at my current place of employment, I merely skimmed over the &#x27;Intellectual Property Rights&#x27; and &#x27;Copyrights&#x27; section of contract. Last year I learned to produce music. I sometimes publish some of it online, free and open source. I happened to re-read my contract for an unrelated reason when these clauses caught my eye, and they looked scary. I compared this contract with some other offer letters I had received in the past, and it seems that this is a common practice.<p>Does this mean the company can technically claim IP right&#x2F;Copyright on anything I create, even if it&#x27;s not a software that competes with them?",
