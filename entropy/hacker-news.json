I am a frequent donor, but I haven&#x27;t logged into Wikipedia account on my mobile. Every time I open any article on mobile, it shows a popup asking me to donate. Nowadays, it has even started showing a counter of how many &#x27;free&#x27; articles I have read so far. Is Wikimedia foundation destitute? Why are they pushing to get capital so fervently? Are people who handle the money just looking to make themselves rich?",
