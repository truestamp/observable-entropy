      "text": "The CDC have been providing &quot;COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Case Investigation and Reporting&quot;[1] information for points in time at close to weekly intervals. Every update erases the previous information and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an easily accessible table of these data. Snapshots of the page can be found on archive.today[2] and I have saved both those and some recent manually downloaded copies from cdc.gov.<p>Because copying &amp; pasting by hand is error-prone, I wrote some code to extract the bits and pieces.<p>The repo is `nanis&#x2F;covid19-breakthrough` on GitHub[3]. Snapshots are in the `snapshots` directory. There is also a CSV containing the time series of reported numbers of non-fatal hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 among the fully vaccinated[4].<p>`out&#x2F;chart.html` shows the time series of fully vaccinated population in millions, hospitalizations and deaths among the fully vaccinated per 100,000 fully vaccinated individuals. You can view it locally by running a simple local web server[5]. There is a copy online[6].<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;health-departments&#x2F;breakthrough-cases.html<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.today&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;covid-19&#x2F;health-departments&#x2F;breakthrough-cases.html<p>[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nanis&#x2F;covid19-breakthrough<p>[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nanis&#x2F;covid19-breakthrough&#x2F;blob&#x2F;11bb7c7495f7c417504971ab8c65aa1f5921baa1&#x2F;out&#x2F;2021-09-10.csv<p>[5]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;willurd&#x2F;5720255<p>[6]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.covid2020.icu&#x2F;vaccine-breakthrough&#x2F;",
