      "text": "Maybe this was obvious to some people but I just realized it. Reading an article that was interesting and I was learning from I realized there were two other links in that article of concepts that I didn&#x27;t understand so I had opened them up in other tabs. And I realized that in order to get the full picture of what I was reading I would need to read those other two links as well. And that&#x27;s because of hyperlinks there&#x27;s always more information and you&#x27;re never finished reading the story. So I kind of realized the corollary of that is maybe that information expands to fill our time but our time to actually do anything with it and act on that information contracts. so the result is that we&#x27;re chronically inattentive to what&#x27;s actually happening in our lives and to the actions we could take to improve things, to the extent that we are engaged with this exponentially expanding field of information. And also we&#x27;re not actually putting it into practice because we&#x27;re spending so much time absorbing the full picture. While an extreme that reflects not how everybody engages with information online all the time tho I think it&#x27;s representative enough of a serious aspect of that, so it does play into our experience these days. And maybe that is one of the reasons that people are feeling less happy even though they have more solutions to all the things that they could improve: because the lack of attention budget means people are less likely to be able to be mindful and less likely to be able to actually take actions to create those improvements, because they&#x27;re constantly learning what actions they could possibly take.<p>Anyway that&#x27;s just my take on this exponential medium thing. I thought it was an interesting characterization of the internet and I&#x27;d never heard it phrased in that way where it&#x27;s exponential in the sense that it relates to your reading input.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by the creative process and how it intertwines with intellectual life (or, some would say they are one and the same). From seemingly simple activities like observing nature, to writing notes, to collecting stuff, to actually producing something, to conversations that spark our mind, etc.<p>I&#x27;m fascinated not only because they are to me intrinsically interesting, but also because many of these activities seem so &quot;regular&quot; or sometimes even regarded as &quot;unproductive&quot; (eg collecting stuff). I think there&#x27;s so much potential in these things that we do, so much potential in ourselves, if only we could explore them more and understand the process better.<p>Anyway, this fascination led me to dream up two things:<p>1. To interview a bunch of creative&#x2F;intellectual people and ask them about their process (ie their various activities and habits and how these influence the creative process).<p>2. To dig into books and articles and archives to find out the creative and intellectual processes of historical figures (e.g., Charles Darwin).<p>Unsurprisingly, I didn&#x27;t do either as the tasks were just too overwhelming. But then I thought, could we possibly &quot;crowdsource&quot; this, here on HN?<p>And so, for whoever&#x27;s interested:<p>1. I would love to hear about your own specific intellectual and creative process, all the details from input to output and everything in between (I think there are insights to be gained from studying the specifics).<p>And&#x2F;or:<p>2. You could share resources (books, articles etc) that describe the processes of historical figures. And maybe give us some highlights for taste.<p>:D",
