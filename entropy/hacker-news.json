      "text": "Just thought of a hypothetical that made me very curious about multiple volume bars. Right at this moment I have a volume slider for spotify, then a layer up there&#x27;s one for my computer, and a further layer up there&#x27;s one physically on my headset. I don&#x27;t know much at all about how volume information is passed (scaling the magnitude of the signal representation of the sound?) Is it possible to nest things deeply enough to actually lose sound quality, or break something, or is everything just nicely passing a float with the percent of maximal volume, and a lossless representation of the sound?",
