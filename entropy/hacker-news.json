      "text": "I am a software engineer with more than 15+ years of experience. While most engineers at my age tends to progress towards managerial positions, it is not for me, and I still want to be an engineer.<p>I have been trying to find a new job since the pandemic, however, the problem is some engineering manager and employers only glance at my yearly contributions of my GitHub profile, ignoring my contributions in the past and software projects (though not actively maintained but they are an important details about me.).<p>That green tile is always on the discussion with the EMs, asking me questions on why &quot;I don&#x27;t have enough Github contributions&quot;, and &quot;they feel that I am not the right candidate&quot; for the position. It is like a weapon they use, that works against me all the time.<p>I filled that green tiles before when I worked on my previous employers on their private repositories, however, it only lasts while I am employed at the company. That green tile will reset back to blank if they remove me from the company (removing my access from the repositories).<p>I would be very happy if you could make it appear optional, as it will bring justice to my engineering experience vs. what&#x27;s on that green tile.<p>I hope you hear me Github.<p>Thank you.",
