      "text": "Hi, HN.<p>I was struggling to get a color palette right for a small game I was making in Unity and decided I&#x27;d throw together something that gave me a few dials to play with. Naturally, when the proof of concept worked I began expanding it and then some every time I wanted more independent control.<p>It was initially born of frustration of not being able to do certain basic things in Photoshop, like invert HSV values independently. And if they were possible they were usually cumbersome.<p>Anyway, It&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job for me for now. So given that color related content seems to be popular here - and I&#x27;ve never contributed a piece of software to the world - I thought I&#x27;d upload it to the web &quot;as is&quot; for free and perhaps someone else might find it useful. Any feedback is appreciated and if there is enough demand I might continue working on.<p>Thanks for your time.",

      "text": "I love building and working - always have, always will. I&#x27;ve been programming for nearly 10 years, 5 of those professionally but the industry is literally destroying my soul and it has recently become crippling.<p>I&#x27;ve been in all kinds of jobs, from start-ups to massive corporate companies. I&#x27;m forever building my own side projects as I love it, as well as love the idea of making my own living but as you all know, side hustles don&#x27;t make money over night.<p>I&#x27;m currently in a great job. By great job I mean, the money is really good, there&#x27;s room to grow and the opportunities are endless... Yet I can&#x27;t bare it. I can&#x27;t bare the devs that go out of their way to work weekends without being asked, I can&#x27;t bare the endless meetings, constant micromanagement, bringing the stress home to my family.<p>I don&#x27;t know where or who to turn to. Can anyone relate?",
