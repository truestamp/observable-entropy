I am struggling to find themes, topics for these.<p>Obviously I can ask questions about work, but we are already in a lot of meetings with other members that cover most or all of the work stuff. I ask questions about what we are going to do in the long term and ask about resource planning and hiring, but these are usually non-repeating because I cannot ask the same question every month. This person is really good and is great at their job and so I would love to have a meaningful conversation with them and learn, however I am not sure what to ask and how to &quot;learn&quot;. I would love to hear your experience with this and any pointers, themes etc.",
