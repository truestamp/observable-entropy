      "text": "We are having difficulty clearly &quot;demarcating&quot; the responsibilities among the co-founders and assigning the conventional executive titles.<p>Obviously, the future investors will be looking for who is who in the company by looking at the titles. Someone has to be the tech lead, someone is marketing, someone has to sign the documents and ultimately take charge of everything.<p>Among us, however, the lines are blurred and somehow none of us wants to be the CEO or take any of the other conventional CxO titles.<p>One option I can think of is having a President and a bunch of VP&#x27;s while leaving the CxO positions open for possible future hires at later rounds. At least there&#x27;s someone, the President, who will sign the papers.<p>Are there any other options that wouldn&#x27;t look too weird from the investors&#x27; point of view?<p>Thank you!",
