      "text": "I&#x27;m working on an open source platform for building 3D content, using what I believe to be a new&#x2F;clever core system design. This platform exports to open source targets, such as Unity.<p>I hope to make a profit off of the concept, in the admittedly very unlikely event that this platform takes off. One play is selling the tech to a graphics company, to fund my development on it.<p>I&#x27;ve been considering patenting all or part of this system, with options like:\n- Try to patent some or part of the system, and only use it as personal financial protection when trying to sell the product, and never enforce it any other way\n- Patent some specific part of the system that no one would care about, to avoid scaring off open source users<p>Worries:\n- Discouraging open source users, who might think it skeevy or unethical to have patented software (see: Unity patenting ECS)\n- A patent preventing&#x2F;discouraging this platform from being embedded&#x2F;used by other open source ecosystems.<p>I have no experience with software patents. I see companies value patents for their IP, and I&#x27;m curious about the patent process, and like the idea of having a patent on my CV. Should I try to patent all or part of this design, while still targeting open source?",
