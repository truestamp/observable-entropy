      "text": "Hi!<p>In times like these it is interesting to get an insight into the sentiment in other countries and cultures. Of course there are a number of non-western news outlets broadcasting in English. E.q. South China Morning Post or Russia Today. Yet, I have the strong impression (or at least the suspicion) those institutions follow a specific agenda for their English recipients which doesn&#x27;t align with the picture they paint when addressing their local audience.<p>In Germany we have a nationwide radio station called Deutschlandfunk (DLF) which delivers an international newsreel [1]. This is about the kind if content I have in mind. Unfortunately DLF is under public law so I&#x27;m not sure if it can be considered politically neutral, particularly when it comes to picking topics. Usually topics are being selected that somehow relate to current topics in local news or are affecting German citizens. But that&#x27;s not a way to see what others see.<p>So, my question: Do you know a source for international news that...?<p>- ... deliveres 1:1 translations of local news on current topics<p>- ... picks topics in a not very tendentious way (which I believe is hard)<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deutschlandfunk.de&#x2F;internationale-presseschau-100.html",
