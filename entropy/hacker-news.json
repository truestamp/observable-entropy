      "text": "Hello,<p>my name is Chris and I am a german developer looking for feedback on an idea of mine that I would like to develop further.<p>The idea is to blend cloud-based storage space with the local file system in order to transparently expand storage space.<p>This would probably best be done as a file system driver which monitors pre-defined folders on the harddisk for given quotas, eventually transferring files to cloudspace when their surpass the preset quota space for the folder.<p>Once safely transferred (controlled by hash value), the local file would be replaced by a link which can then be resolved upon re-request of the file.<p>The idea is to thereby provide some sort of elastic storage space which only holds the most important&#x2F;most often requested files locally. Everything else gets transferred to the cloud.<p>Would that be of interest to the community?<p>Thanks for any insight&#x2F;comment&#x2F;suggestion.",
