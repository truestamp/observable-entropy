Any category, even JS frameworks (I&#x27;d nominate SvelteKit).<p>Few of mine:\n1) Dishwasher with automatic detergent dispenser. Such a tiny improvement but huge difference (mine is Beko but brand irrelevant)<p>2) Samsung DeX desktop mode for Android phones. Surprisingly smooth experience with external monitor, keyboard and mouse. Looking for continued development to replace primary device in a few years (unless VR gets there first)..<p>3) Domestic again, and pretty well known, but induction stoves. Surprisingly many still don&#x27;t use one..",
