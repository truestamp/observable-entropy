      "text": "Hello HN!\nFor the past 15 years, I&#x27;ve been working as a Software Developer Engineer. I&#x27;ve focused mostly in back-end languages, and also a bit of front-end (though I&#x27;m not up-to-date with the latest Front-End trends). I have added a lot of value to the companies I&#x27;ve worked for, but I have the feeling I&#x27;ve never been compensated fairly.\n1) My question for you guys is: how much should I charge per hour?\n2) Is there a way to finding clients or companies that pay better wages?\nThanks!",
