I&#x27;m working on building a new political party (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;allogov.us&#x2F;), and would appreciate some feedback on this!<p>If the website isn’t clear, the idea is to get voters to sync on who to vote on. If the party wins, voters will get direct access to individual policy items, instead of a bundle of policies (the representative will vote in line with the app.)<p>What&#x27;re you looking for in a new political party?<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to go about finding the first users: Anyone know anyone who has advice on this?<p>Thanks!",
