      "text": "We (Screenplay, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screenplay.dev) built an internal tool (Graphite) to enable stacked diffs on GitHub for an individual (i.e. you can adopt it without your team also having to adopt it). It&#x27;s inspired by some of the internal tooling we had at bigger companies. Specifically, the tool has two parts:<p><pre><code>  * The CLI - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;screenplaydev&#x2F;graphite-cli: Allows you to create diffs, restack them, submit them to GitHub, etc. It runs locally and stores all the metadata in your .git folder.\n  * The website - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.graphite.dev&#x2F;: A UI layer on top of GitHub (ultimately reads&#x2F;writes from GitHub). OAuth in to have a better&#x2F;customizable review queue and stack visualization, with notifs and an improved code review UI coming soon.\n</code></pre>\nYou can use those two either separately or together. Would love people&#x27;s feedback!",
