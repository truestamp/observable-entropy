      "text": "uBlock Origin is more than an ad-blocker, it&#x27;s a general purpose content filter that can be leveraged to hide low-quality content from pages you browse. While the main filter lists can remove mailing list popups and obvious nags, the definition of low-quality content is personal, so one size cannot fit all.<p>I used to have an ad-hoc script to render and publish a personal uBlock Origin filter list, added to all my browsers. The goal of this project is to enable more people to build such a list custom list to filter out low-quality content and nags. Chose from a list of community-maintained templates, set your options, add your custom rules, and get your personal filter list.<p>The project is still pretty young and needs more filter templates, and some frontend improvements (my previous frontend project was in 2005, this is not my forte). Any feedback is welcome!",
