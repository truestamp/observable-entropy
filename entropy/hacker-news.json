      "text": "I am quite curious about those who attain highly paid job at big tech companies like MAGMA that are still not satisfied with their job. I believe most of the engineers working at big tech should be happy about their position. Yet, I see frequent comments on why people want to quit big tech and work for a local startup or smaller company. Why is it being such a trend?<p>If it is a moral issue or interest conflicts, I completely understand it. Other than that, what may be the reasons? I would like to know your opinions on it!<p>Thank you in advance.",
