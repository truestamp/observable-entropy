      "text": "I&#x27;m looking to run a hands-on course for some students as an intro to networking.  I find the best way is to have some hands on experience to go with the theory.  With that in mind, I&#x27;d like to use something like a raspberry pi or old server as a plaything of the students.  What&#x27;s the best way to set them all up in isolated environments that they can easily remotely access?<p>Am I best to just create 30 odd virtual machines?  Can I achieve the same outcome without the overhead of a VM?",
