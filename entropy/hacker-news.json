You can post description about the threads here. Other people can try to help the author find the articles. Additionally, Since people forget most of the things they read but they still remember ( or are trying to remember)  the posts mentioned here, the posts are bound to be very interesting.<p>Tips on what you can&#x2F;should mention while trying to find a thread -<p>1. Add a vague Timeline when it was written&#x2F;posted here.\n2. If you remember anything about the author, mention it.\n3. You can mention what kind of discussions happened in HN Threads of the topic.\n4. Write whatever you remember about the blog.<p>I&#x27;m submitting the threads I want to find below as an example.",
