But when did Russia has become an enemy for EU?<p>Looking for reasons why EU would fight Russia, I don&#x27;t think EU is foolish enough to believe that Russia would invade EU? Has the EU become too incapable of producing their own food and energy and concerned about their supplies being cut-off? Don&#x27;t thikn it is supplies issue as EU itself is cutting it off, by going for Oil embargo etc. Also, if they have to depend on someone for their basic needs, I don&#x27;t think they will be seen as &quot;developed&quot; country or bloc.<p>Why is EU going with sanctions and enmity which are likely to hurt themselves just as much as they would hurt Russia? I think EU is being arm-twisted by USA and not following a sensible political strategy here. What kind of an end-scenario, for which EU is working towards? How would that end-scenario be good for EU and how feasible is that scenario and at what cost? What do you think?",
