      "text": "www outline.com is offline&#x2F;unreachable since about 10 days. It is&#x2F;was(?) a very useful service to make some webpages more readable and (in some case) avoid the paywall. I also used it a lot of time to extract the &quot;reader view&quot; of some article to send it via email. But since 7-10 the website is down but domain looks okay. I&#x27;m also using a recursive DNS resolver so it&#x27;s not blocked via DNS from my ISP.<p>Someone know what&#x27;s going on? I haven&#x27;t found other info.<p>Thanks",
