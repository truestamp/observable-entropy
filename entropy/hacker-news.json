      "text": "I own the app called &#x27;Cuff&#x27; on the app store. Cuff is a popular 1 on 1 video chatting app, and it has many competitors. One of the competitors is a Chinese owned app called &#x27;Monkey&#x27;.<p>They don&#x27;t like how I rank for the search term &#x27;Monkey&#x27;, and demand a monopoly on the search results for the term.<p>I don&#x27;t have the term in my keywords or anywhere in my app meta-data. But my app still ranks for the keyword. It ranks for a lot of keywords I don&#x27;t have directly in my meta-data. I guess because of its overall popularity?<p>Anyways, they are saying I am infringing on their trademark, and I have no clue what action to take. Apple says they can remove my app if I don&#x27;t act, but there&#x27;s literally no action to take.<p>Do I have legal grounds here? I am thinking if Apple removes my app, I can take them to small claims court to try to make a case for reinstatement, since I am a one-man shop for the app.<p>It really sucks this is happening. I hate how some random Chinese shadow tech company can make Apple do their bidding in the US, so that American individuals&#x2F;companies can&#x27;t fight back. Since they are in China, I don&#x27;t even know how I can take action against them for bogus trademark claims.<p>The only action I can think of is to take against Apple.",
