      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;ve been scanning a lot of personal sensitive documents such as IDs, banking information, etc. in order to have backups available easily, and I have been wondering about the best way to securely store this information in the cloud.<p>The main requirements, in order of importance (in my mind at least) would be:<p>1. Security. Even if my cloud account is compromised the data itself should not be accessible without entering a second password.\n2. Availability. It should be accessible from a computer but also a phone or any other (i)device.\n3. Not limited to storing sensitive data. I should be able to have in the same service some other documents that I don&#x27;t care about having &quot;stolen&quot; such as some random ebook or video that I wanted to backup. It means that it should have a high storage capacity available for a reasonable price.<p>Right now my best idea is to store a file encrypted via VeraCrypt on any generic cloud storage such as Dropbox, but it causes issues with availability.<p>Thanks for your suggestions!",
