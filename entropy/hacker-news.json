      "text": "I want to experiment with zoomable, pannable interfaces on the web. Basically, an interface like Figma, but for interacting with different types of structured data. Think: web-ish interfaces for web-ish data on an infinite pannable, zoomable canvas.<p>Why? I&#x27;ve become incredibly bored with how homogenized the web has become, everything a neat, perfect grid. Moreover, I want to explore what might be possible in building interfaces outside of these repeatable patterns and paradigms.<p>I&#x27;m aware of a few react libraries for rendering to canvas such as react-konva, react-ape, etc. Most of what I&#x27;ve found are plugins for React itself.<p>That might be the right way to think about the problem, but it might not be. I&#x27;m at the earliest exploratory stage of this, so it&#x27;s worth questioning if React is the right abstraction for this in the first place.<p>Hence, is there something <i>like React</i> (but not React) for building these types of zoomable&#x2F;pannable interfaces?<p>OTOH, maybe React is the right abstraction, in which case, I&#x27;d love to hear anyone&#x27;s experiences building these types of interfaces.",
