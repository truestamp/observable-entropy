      "text": "Hey guys, I made this free haptic rest timer for Apple Watch and would really appreciate your feedback!<p>Main idea: use haptics to notify you when your rest is up and it’s time to go for another set.<p>It functions similar to a timer. However, a traditional timer continues to ring until the user presses the stop button which can be quite annoying when done frequently.\nInstead, this app simply notifies through haptic feedback when the break is over. User input is minimal.<p>My goal is to reduce gadget interactions between sets and make the workout experience more distraction-free and enjoyable.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts! Thank you<p>Link to App Store: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;app&#x2F;haptic-fitness-timer&#x2F;id1623382793?l=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;app&#x2F;haptic-fitness-timer&#x2F;id1623382...</a>",
