Due to changes in profession I stopped paying attention to the field around 2017. Now I&#x27;ve been asked to do a seminar about the topic and I wonder:<p>What happened in creative coding in the last five years? What did I miss? Where is the field going now?<p>I would love to get your input with links and hints to exceptional projects and articles you encountered in the last few years and will be eternally grateful for the help of this collective mind.",
