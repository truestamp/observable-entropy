      "text": "A few questions for anyone at Spotify:<p>- Why isn&#x27;t there a list of new episodes from podcasts you follow? (This should be MVP- absolutely every other podcast service i know of has this!)\n- How exactly am I supposed to use the &quot;your episodes&quot; playlist?\n- Why don&#x27;t podcasts always sort correctly when you go to a podcast list? \n- Why can&#x27;t I search within an artist&#x27;s page? even if it&#x27;s limited to their discography?\n- Why can&#x27;t there be a separate list item in the sidebar for podcasts, artists and albums?\n- Why can&#x27;t I get to the &quot;find podcasts&quot; area from the library (or the your episodes area)? this used to exist!\n- in the podcasts section in your library, why can&#x27;t I sort by most recently updated?<p>I get why Spotify is pushing podcasts so hard, but why not implement some absolutely basic features?<p>Phone issues:\n- Why does it take so long (if it even shows up) for downloaded podcasts to show up when you&#x27;re offline?\n    - what&#x27;s the point of downloading them if they won&#x27;t show up?!?!?!?!?!",
