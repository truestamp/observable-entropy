      "text": "Probably a rant, but I expect way more from a company which makes it a business to know so much about everyone. Why does their Career page not work at all? Every single job role, I have to literally fill up my entire resume, the auto detection doesn&#x27;t work (I tried multiple resume formats that support ATS system), it doesn&#x27;t recognize that I am already signed into my profile. Compared to this Amazon Jobs works great, it remembers everything and you just have to hit submit to a position of your choice. \nAnd despite filling everything manually, the META&#x27;s career page tells you it will send a confirmation email, but you never receive one.",
