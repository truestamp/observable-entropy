A few months ago, I discovered Ionic and I absolutely love it.\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;ionicframework.com&#x2F;<p>I’m not convinced I could build an “enterprise” app with it but for little personal throw away projects, I think it’s great.<p>For anyone not familiar with it, it basically wraps a native app around a webview and provides a bunch of css to make the app feel more native.<p>I built a little mobile app with it last month but I got especially excited by the idea of making a mobile game. I just threw in an HTML canvas element and I was successfully able to build a short game. What’s great is UI is also pretty easy to add with HTML.<p>Over all it took me roughly 2 days to make a small mobile game which I’m counting as a success.<p>Link for anyone interested in the game:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;cluckeroo&#x2F;id161543070",
