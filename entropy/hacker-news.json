Also I usually do it when I have a problem that I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to solve, but after the nap I feel like my brain is completely fresh and prepared to solve it. It&#x27;s like a hidden superpower. I don&#x27;t understand why people don&#x27;t talk openly about more that and pretend they are always productive.",
