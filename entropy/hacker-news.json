      "text": "Has anyone else noticed this? I&#x27;m in Austin, and I help my 2 elderly parents. Dad gave up driving due to age-related macular degeneration -- and I&#x27;m really happy he did. We&#x27;ve been using Lyft (and to a lesser degree Uber) for 2+ years and it&#x27;s been great for giving him mobility and reducing his risk.<p>But... one thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you book a trip, and then book a return trip... the return trip is ALWAYS more expensive than it should be. I think Lyft is deflating &quot;leaving home&quot; and inflating &quot;going home&quot; costs. I assume they are thinking, &quot;Let&#x27;s make it easy to take the trip, and then once we have you... we&#x27;ll make up the difference.&quot;<p>Anyway our hack is just to take Uber one way, and Lyft the other. Seems to save a ton of money. Or book from one account one-way, and another for the return.<p>For example, this morning... Dad had a dental appointment, and the &quot;to the dentist&quot; cost at 7:30 AM was $35. The &quot;return home&quot; cost at 9:45 AM was $105! Crazy since traffic had died own a bit by then.<p>When I plotted the same course from my app at the same time, it was $32. So I just booked a trip for Dad on my Lyft account. The cost would have been over $70 more if he just &quot;defaulted&quot; to taking a Lyft home from the same account that he used to get to the dentist.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, these services are a godsend. But... can&#x27;t help but feel like some of the shady from Taxi company history remains.<p>I&#x27;ve only got cursory evidence, but seems to be a trend. When Dad goes somewhere, the return cost is higher. I just have him call me and I book the return on my account. Almost always saves money.",
