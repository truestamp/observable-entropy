      "text": "I am running an indie SaaS company and I intend to continue that work for next 2-5 years. However, it&#x27;s becoming clear to me (especially after becoming a father) that I want to do something that is good for the climate. So I am spawning a background thread in my brain that will ponder what that means in the long run.<p>I can&#x27;t do politics even if that is possibly the most important factor. I don&#x27;t have any skills and I certainly don&#x27;t have the desire. I also don&#x27;t know anything about physics or chemical engineering etc. I think those are skills I <i>could</i> obtain but say I want to capitalize on the developer&#x2F;CTO skills that I have amassed over two decades, where should I be working to maximize my impact?<p>I am slowly educating myself on renewable energy, battery tech, carbon capture and things like that. There are so many frontiers and since everything needs software, I feel that I should be able to help.<p>Should I create a company&#x2F;NGO that creates software for a sector? Or should I try to join something existing and what would that be?<p>Alternatively, where should I start looking? Is there a publication or podcast that I should subscribe to?<p>I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas!",
