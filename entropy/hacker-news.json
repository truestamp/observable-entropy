They actually even redacted certain parts of the conversation they deemed confidential.<p>It&#x27;s all fun and games until the US and the EU start adopting the very same totalitarian measures, they have been critising for decades in other countries.<p>The conversation with Ben Wallace can be watched in its entirety (excluding the redacted parts) at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;@RaymondTheBrave:5&#x2F;Full-Video-by-Vovan-and-Lexus-with-UK-Secretary-of-State-for-Defence-Ben-Wallace:a",
