      "text": "When looking for Autohotkey scripts or solutions to ancient Windows problems, I find myself on old forums with people that may or may not be alive now. What I find interesting is the enthusiasm that they showed to answer questions and contribute to forums often for free. I myself was on a couple of these forums long ago, and I remember the excitement of hitting refresh every now and then and getting a reply to what I had posted. There was no such notifications on your phone, most people did not have fancy profiles and images, and a profile on site X was not connected to the same person&#x27;s profile on site Y. There was no login with Google&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;etc., and the forums did not have neither minimalist designs nor modern web JS bs.<p>Some of those forums still exist today, and I often wonder &quot;who&#x27;s still on them?!&quot; In the age of fast information, sadly, the social construct of forums is no more, at least for average people who only know the Web through FB pages, tiktok videos, Discord, etc.<p>It makes me both nostalgic and sad to compare the current state of the Web with the gem we had not too long ago. Maybe I&#x27;m not alone. In that case, what are your thoughts on this?",
