      "text": "I’ve encountered a specific problem in a market (product managers at startups and SMBs) that hasn’t been sufficiently solved. I have validated some demand for it, as well as basic requirements, although nothing formally documented.<p>Right now I just have pages and pages of notes (competitor research, ideas, prospective user feedback, etc.). I don’t have any formal specs written.<p>Goal: build a functional prototype and get my first actual users.<p>I’m a product manager, so while I can fumble my way around a command line, I don’t think I myself can build this thing.  There are lots of options — no code, prototype in InVision, hire a freelance. What’s my next step for getting this built? Assuming I have basically zero funds and will be bootstrapping it myself.<p>Few other things to note: app will leverage several APIs, require basic auth, a few integrations (though doesn’t have to be MVP).<p>I have the confidence and some validation, but now what?",
