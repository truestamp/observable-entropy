      "text": "For context: I have been working as a Sales Ops Associate for the past 2 years at a Startup which has gone from pre-series A to applying for Series B in the beginning of next year.<p>Up until now I have thoroughly enjoyed the creativity and freedom my job allows, however out of the blue I get a job offer from Snap to go work the same title for more money (with the work being slightly more repetitive). I go through the interviews and get offered the job without much fuss.<p>I then go back to my company expecting them to not be able to match this new offer but low and behold they get very close to it (within $5-10k), even additionally offering both 4,000 more shares (brining my total up to 9,000) and a better title (Senior Business Intelligence Analyst) to boot.<p>This really put me in a dilemma, as I thoroughly enjoy the work that I do but I am concerned that turning down the offer to be at Snap (if only for a year or two) would effect my career prospects due to reduced brand power. But on the flip side the job title being offered allows for more scope in future roles than being locked into Sales Operations long term.<p>My main questions would be:\n1. Has anyone here worked at Snapchat before and can they give any feedback as to the work-life balance&#x2F;career progression?<p>2. Does title really matter? Would other companies care if I was called Sales Operations or BI Analyst?<p>3. What is the likelihood of a company at Series B going public? And how long would you expect it to take to go public?<p>4. Does Snapchat have a good public image for hirees? Or is it not comparable to FAANG?<p>I really appreciate any help anyone can offer on this.",
