      "text": "Hey HN! I just released weron, a P2P VPN that uses WebRTC for transport which I&#x27;ve been working on for the last couple of months. It can create both layer 2&#x2F;Ethernet and layer 3&#x2F;IP overlay networks, and the underlying transport layer can be easily embedded to write your own P2P apps with Go. Compared to for example Tailscale, Wireguard and ZeroTier, its much harder to block on a network level and also significantly easier to set up, while not sacrifing much performance.<p>I&#x27;d love to get your feedback :)",
