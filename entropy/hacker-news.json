      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I’ve been suffering from chronic fatigue since pretty much forever (certainly for the last ~20 years). I’m 38 this year.<p>Most days I’ll get out of bed worn and tired. I have trouble focusing &#x2F; starting to do things (I need to force myself to do them, which sometimes doesn’t work out; consequently, I’m procrastinating quite a lot, which I found to exacerbate the issue – I’m feeling _less_ tired when actually working). Sometimes even thinking about doing something makes me feel tired. Things get better in the afternoon, which makes me a night owl.<p>There are days when I’m feeling energetic and have a natural can-do attitude, but they are few and far between, and I wasn’t able to establish variables that they correlate with. Most of the time, I manage to chug along, but it’s growing on me.<p>I sleep ~7h on weekdays, 10h+ on weekends. I don’t exercise much, but I enjoy walking and cycling (I cycle ~1kkm a year).<p>I highly doubt that I’m suffering from depression. The fatigue is perhaps the #1 detriment to my life quality. Outside of it, I have an awesome and healthy relationship, a job that I enjoy, financial safety, and I generally feel that I won the game of life.<p>I’d love to hear from people who have suffered from similar symptoms. Anything that has helped you? Please let me know.<p>As an experiment this year, I resolved to do daily morning walks. I’ll see how it goes.",
