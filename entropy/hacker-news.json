Generally I found the screening rounds of FANG to be less time intensive than take-home.<p>If you are going to reject me after the take-home. Given my time investment wouldn&#x27;t it be reasonable to ask for feedback? At the very least I can work on it and improve my skills.<p>We should reject companies with take-home assignments if they do not provide take-home assignments. What do you guys think?",
