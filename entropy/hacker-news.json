      "text": "After reading horror stories about innocent people being locked out of their Google accounts, I&#x27;d like to backup my Google data (Gmail, drive, photos, possibly contacts) to another cloud provider like OneDrive.<p>It is critical for me that the process is automatic and that the backed-up data are encrypted. (Google Takeout isn&#x27;t fully automatic out of the box.)<p>I am thinking about some combination of Thunderbird, VeraCrypt&#x2F;BoxCryptor, and insynchq (because it supposedly downloads Google Docs). Would anybody be willing to share their own setup?<p>This question was asked before but received few answers [0].\n0. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25420082",
