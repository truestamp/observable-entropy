This should have been an easy thing to do.\nHowever, the domain name was, within Microsoft 365, still associated with &lt;othercompany&gt;.onmicrosoft.com - a link that can only be removed my MS Support or &lt;othercompany&gt;.\n&lt;othercompany&gt; probably held the domain name in the past.<p>I&#x27;ve had to spend 4 hours getting MS attention:\n- the only support option I get was phone. No online ticketing\n- my first two calls were interrupted after 30 and 40 minutes, respectively\n- my third and last call, which lasted more than an hour, resulted in a ticket number<p>It seems to me that a previously expired domain name being enrolled into MS 365 should be a common use case with a more streamlined support process.",
