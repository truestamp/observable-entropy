      "text": "I am working on a project. I have broken down the requirements into the following workloads:<p>- Data collection: This is a batch service that receives large amount REST data (expecting 20k request over few hours) when triggered. The trigger will happen once or twice a day.\n- Pricing algorithm: This service will take the above data as input then price them. I&#x27;m expecting 100 req&#x2F;sec at initial stage.\n- Transaction: When a customer buys a new product, a webhook is received from payment provider then the database is updated.\n- Admin: A back office service that will update less often. Here admin can set application parameters and able to get insights of the customers.<p>My current plan for the infrastructure is the following:\n- application server to host the above 4 NodeJS services using PM2 \n- routing using Nginx\n- ELB to loadbalance the app servers\n- Elasticache redis to queue the batch data\n- RDS DB for all services (both read and write)\n- GitActions for CI&#x2F;CD\n- Monitoring using DataDog<p>Will the above infrastructure will be able to handle my requirements? Can it be improved?<p>My concern is- if there&#x27;s a way to reliably reconnect if the data sync fails on 1st service?<p>PS: I have a time constraint too. So my team can&#x27;t be trained to learn K8s for now.<p>Thank you all in advance.",
