If their responses fail your filters, the recruiter gets an email saying so, so they know not to bother you again.<p>The idea is that recruiters can never see your filter values<p>You can rate limit individual recruiter submissions per day (they have to log in to submit)<p>Keen for any feedback thanks!<p>I&#x27;m especially keen for any feedback from recruiters if you do decide to use it :)<p>cheers,\ndar",
