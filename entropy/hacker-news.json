      "text": "With the modern computing age we are finding that tech companies build out platforms for others to use, but then also create their own content on these platforms, and then unfairly leverage the platform to prefer their content over others.<p>This is clearly anti-trust, yet it happens over and over.  Google&#x2F;Android.  Amazon&#x27;s store vs amazon&#x27;s own products.  Microsoft&#x2F;Xbox, and so forth.  Even historically this is the heart of what&#x27;s defined previous monopolies -- like when the movie studios had to sell off the theaters in the mid-20th century, for the same reason.<p>It&#x27;d be a really clean fix if it was clarified in our legislation that if you provide a platform which allows other companies to add content into (i.e. an operating system, or ecosystem like iphone, xbox, playstation), AND you also provide content for that platform (applications&#x2F;games), that you have to maintain separation and openness -- your platform cannot provide any advantage to your applications over others, and CONVERSELY that your content producers (studios) cannot be exclusive.<p>In the latest deal with Microsoft -- they shouldn&#x27;t be buying studios to provide content to their xbox platform and ALSO making them exclusive xbox.<p>Is clarification like this even possible with our legislation?",
