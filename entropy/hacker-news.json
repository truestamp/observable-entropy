      "text": "We (a group of 4th year Software Engineering students) have created 3D virtual escape rooms that are aimed to help students learn more about mental health resources in a fun interactive way. Given the pandemic and remote learning environment, we thought it would be a cool idea to challenge ourselves and see if we can create an online fun interactive environment.<p>The full admin interface includes the ability to build, modify and publish escape rooms without any technical knowledge.<p>Other escape room sample: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interactive.calgaryconnecteen.com&#x2F;supporting-youth-in-crisis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interactive.calgaryconnecteen.com&#x2F;supporting-youth-i...</a><p>Tech used: A-Frame, Python (backend server), PostgreSQL, React (Admin interface)",

      "text": "Hello,<p>This is&#x2F;was me: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29690759<p>I am now looking at Interview Kickstart and Outco to help me prepare for dev interviews. IK seems cheaper overall, but aside from that, I am not sure which one is best for me. I have heard that Outco is more geared towards early career devs or people with very little experience at all, whereas IK is more about experienced devs who want to break into bigtech. I am not even sure whether I count as &quot;experienced&quot; given the small nature of the startups I used to work at as well as how much I now realize I have forgotten due to my law school hiatus.<p>Anyone have any experience with either? Even if not, what do people think I should be looking for? Across which attributes should I be comparing and scrutinizing their respective offerings?<p>Thanks",
