      "text": "I&#x27;m hiring for some technical positions, and noticed that I&#x27;m getting a lot of resumes that link to a GitHub profile with a common set of characteristics:<p>- A long README.md with lots of awards&#x2F;stats images.<p>- Lots of repositories with single commits, no real explanations in the READMEs.<p>- Most of the repos have five to ten stars each, but if you open them up they are basically the same people over and over starring all the repos.<p>I don&#x27;t want to share links to example profiles because these may be real people, and maybe there&#x27;s some legitimate scenario where profiles look like this that I&#x27;m just not thinking of? It seems though like it&#x27;s just pumping fake data to drive the stats in the readme.<p>The resumes that come along with the profiles seem normal enough, so I wanted to ask here if it&#x27;s something that others are seeing as well? And if it&#x27;s a red flag, as I assume at this point?",

This makes the process quite cumbersome for potential new employees.\nWhy isn&#x27;t there a standardized format for CV&#x27;s? This could be anything from XML, JSON, YAML, CSV or some other text based format. This way the applicants don&#x27;t have to fill in a news form every time and HR can just import the file into their system.<p>I&#x27;ve searched around a bit but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any solution similar to this.",
