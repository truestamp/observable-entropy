      "text": "Running out of space on my iPhone, I&#x27;m looking for ways to clean up. My app list frustrates me:<p>- Every Google app is &gt; 150 MB. Probably all of the Google libraries are included in every app.\n- Two banking apps with identical functionality: one is 163 MB, the other is 20 MB. How did the (better) bank efficiently squeeze all the functionality into their app that the bank required 163 MB to do?\n- Hugely bloated apps like Twitter are nothing but web shells and occupy 300 MB plus data&#x2F;cache.<p>I realize that this is like shaking my fist at clouds, but what can we do? Is this simply lazy app development, including too many libraries or debug symbols?<p>Someone will say, &quot;upgrade your phone.&quot; Yes, this is what Apple would like me to do, ideally every year. I have a different mentality about the longevity of electronics and e-waste. The only thing that would be driving my upgrade at this point is unnecessarily bloated apps.",
