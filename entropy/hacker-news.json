      "text": "You know how it happens: we want to achieve something (intent) so we put a few actions into place, according to our plans of cause -&gt; effect.<p>But reality is the ultimate feedback mechanism, and things don&#x27;t work out as intended.  #Failure.<p>And then, we start looking for ways on how it&#x27;s not our fault, whose fault it was, mitigating circumstances... you know the drill.<p>But, what if the post-mortem staring point were: I was wrong, 100% wrong!<p>I am not talking about playing the victim, quite the opposite: playing the main actor, who.. well, failed. And chances are the root causes of the failures are the worldviews and the habits that drove the reasoning of cause -&gt; effect and therefore the actions.<p>And if we look at the actions as software, the habits and worldviews are the equivalent of the Operating System.<p>Starting with the presupposition that we are 100% wrong allows us to re-writhe the OS, and then, in the future, make better cause-&gt;effect evaluations and therefore put into motion better actions.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this exercise for a few months now, and - after the initial show - it&#x27;s quite eye opening and good personal development tool.<p>What does HN think?<p>P.S.: Along the same lines, we need to stop sugar coating the word &quot;Failure&quot; and just embrace it for what it is. A failure.  And failure are necessary steps on the way to greater means; failures are not terminal, that&#x27;s death. Death is terminal, and it&#x27;s not a failure is, life.",
