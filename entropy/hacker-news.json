      "text": "Hi everyone,<p>I have been working in finance as a Quant, basically combining some aspects of data science with tool programming. In my free time I worked on side projects including with Flask,  Django and Plotly Dash. Basically worked with Python with a pinch of React mixed in. I’m 38 now and seriously considering to move into a software company in the hopes that I can work on probects like my sideprojects. Although I am willing to learn a lot and invest time, I am afraid that I may not be good enough. Should I take a chance and quit my new job as a math and physics teacher (it just does not make me happy)at a high school to persue a position at a software company?<p>I am at a crossroad now and am happy for any hint if you have ever seen a similar move work out.<p>Thank you in advance for any reply!",
