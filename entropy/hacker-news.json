      "text": "Hi all,\nI&#x27;m not sure if I had not realized before or if HN really changed its CSS.\nSince yesterday I see slightly bigger text for the OP at Ask HN posts. This is not an issue. However, when I change the window size and it&#x27;s between 750px and 810px, the layout is not fitting and the text is not properly wrapped so a very annoying horizontal scroll appears.<p>Does anybody else have this issue?<p>Thank you!",
