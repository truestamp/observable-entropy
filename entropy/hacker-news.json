      "text": "I wrote a shell script, I&#x27;d like to make available for others to use. Scripting language ideally shouldn&#x27;t matter. Users should not have to care what I used. I&#x27;d like to target users who want to easily install a new command line tool on Linux&#x2F;Mac and receive updates, but preferably without the need to install another package manager.<p>There is the possibility to package it for many package managers, like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jordansissel&#x2F;fpm<p>Other possibilities would be npm (most people have it already installed), zsh plugins (limited user base), deno (rewrite your shell script in typescript - which is probably a good thing).<p>Any other ideas?
