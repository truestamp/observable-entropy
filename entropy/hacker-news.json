      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working with web testing frameworks (Selenium and its wrappers &#x2F; Cypress &#x2F; Puppeteer &#x2F; Playwright &#x2F; others) for the last few years, but I asked myself what &quot;frameworks of the future&quot; should look like. I found myself not wanting things too wild or different from what we have today - just incremental improvements. Is that objectively true? What, if anything, is the next leap forward? Or are we close to them being &quot;good enough&quot; for the most part?<p>My top &quot;problems&quot;, in some shape or form, from existing products:<p>- Be faster to complete builds<p>- Have fewer false positives (or do accurate self-healing magic)<p>- Be easier to get started with (or be optionally codeless like Selenium IDE)<p>- Don&#x27;t be a walled garden (what if I want to run the same logical &#x27;test&#x27; across Playwright and Cypress)<p>- Help me write better tests (or be difficult to write bad tests within)<p>- Emulate mobile devices better than just viewport modification<p>What do the HN folks think?",
