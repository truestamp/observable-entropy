      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m an extremely lazy business owner that sells a popular consumer product. There are a lot of promoters and advocates who reach out via email who love my product and are always trying to partner and collaborate with me; yet usually when I am quickly going through emails I am way too lazy to open a CRM and create an entry for them. So a lot of them fall through the cracks.<p>What I want is a CRM that integrates very nicely with email. I don&#x27;t ever want to leave my inbox; so I would like to be able to do something like forward the email to some address like noreply@mycrm.com and include some maybe structured data that the crm knows how to interpret and create an entry for. A bonus would to have it similarly integrated with other customer touch points like IG&#x2F;FB.<p>Maybe it could just pipe it to google sheets or zapier for further processing. Anything like this exist? If it doesn&#x27;t, I would like to build it. I really need it; maybe others do too. Thank you.",
