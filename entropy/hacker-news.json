      "text": "Hi HN,<p>We built a new SDK for removing background noise in audio: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getutterly.com. It works much better than the built-in options available in Zoom, Teams and Hangouts and covers a wide range of background noises. Best of all it runs on CPU in real-time, so that you can use it in your audio communication apps. You can check out the noise coverage demo here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.utterly.app&#x2F;#demo.<p>The integration is simple - you only need two lines of code integrate the SDK into your app. We currently support any audio API, including WebRTC. If you are interested, please feel free to reach out to us!",
