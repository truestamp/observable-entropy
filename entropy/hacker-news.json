      "text": "This might be a long shot. I run a PreK-12 free math tutoring company (it&#x27;s a non-profit to help close the learning gap). Our approach, which we&#x27;ve found quite effective is to combine kids working on the best digital learning apps with the support of one-on-one tutoring. (Basically kids bring an app and get support from tutors as needed). I want to expand our horizons and am wondering if anyone has tried out any fantastic data science or financial literacy apps? We are pretty good on the math and coding fronts, but could use more good suggestions for data science and financial literacy. Thanks so much for suggestions! We are also open to testing out new products people are developing. Thanks!",
