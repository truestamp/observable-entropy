      "text": "I used Scrivener, Google Docs, LeanPub (online editor) but I’m not happy with all of them. I especially need a way to document research and rearranging chapters. Scrivener is awesome for that, but it’s mobile app and cloud sync is so crappy. And the final book generation (pdf, epub, etc.) is really clunky. I discovered leanpub a couple of months ago and it’s simplicity and fast generation is cool, but the online editor is not available on mobile and the asset management is way too simple.",
