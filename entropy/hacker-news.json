      "text": "These days I keep reading about web3 and how it means the next iteration (revolution ??) of the web and how it will protect free speech (?) and some other advantages.<p>I liked a lot the period of mid to late 1990 until mid 2000s where I was mostly communicated with strangers over internet and focused on learning things. I installed my first linux version those days, setup a mail server and then later a http server, played with Netscape and Mozaic. Remember using Pine to read emails and I remember how many nights I spent downloading resources from mailing lists as the internet was cheap during the night.<p>What a wonderful time going from linux to window 3.1 to windows 95 back to Fedora and Redhat and waiting hours with enthusiasm to install a new OS and playing with what it had to offer, discovering almost every default installed program, tweaking and sharing and learning.<p>Do you think that web3 will really work? My scepticism is related to users hosting content for other users. I don&#x27;t see yet how this will truly work at a massive scale. But of course I did not read everything about this subject so I am sure there are things that I miss, maybe trends that I am not aware of.",
