      "text": "I was looking at websites like, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blockcerts.org&#x2F;, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;certif-id.com&#x2F; , https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dnv.com&#x2F;assurance&#x2F;certificates-in-the-blockchain.html and it seems like that there seems to be a use for issuing certificates in blockchain. Apart from the fact that your data won&#x27;t be tampered with and will always stay on there (no one would just delete it), I cannot find any other pros&#x2F;advantage of storing certificates in blockchain.<p>In the certif-id website, the company claimed that &quot;ASDC chose Certif-ID as their go to platform to automate their certification process. With Certif-ID, they optimised their certification process using blockchain to protect their brand against certificate fraud and ease their operational flow.&quot; I don&#x27;t really get how blockchain can help automate the process, as someone still has to issue the documents? The only automation I see is verification becoming easy, but to be quite honest that can be done with traditional solutions too. The only new thing that blockchain puts forward here is, that the certificates are tamper-proof. But even that can be implemented by hashing.<p>Is this quackery, or is there some advantage that I don&#x27;t seem to understand. Some of you are entrepreneurs here and may have services where you guys issue certs, do you guys see yourself using their services, if yes why?<p>Also, I am not critical of blockchain, I am a student who is looking into writing a paper on blockchain related topic, and I was thinking of writing some literature in this topic, but I want to get an intuitive understanding of why this technology is better. Or <i>how can it get better?</i> or <i>where this technology can lead to?</i> To me, I believe, good scalable solution at the same level as blockchain can be provided using old technology.<p>(This is not a hate thread, I am genuinely curious, as I mentioned, I am thinking of working on a blockchain paper)",
