      "text": "There have been various discussions of Literate Programming on HN, a technology Knuth said was one of his best ideas.<p>The book &quot;Lisp In Small Pieces&quot; by Christian Queinnec is, in my opinion, the best example of a literate program available.<p>The ideas are developed very, very carefully. The explanations in the paragraphs are clear and to-the-point. Actual code implementing the idea appears after each explanation, essentially using code like a physics book uses equations.<p>Christian introduces ideas, like environment variables or continuations, in simple steps. He also discusses alternatives, their pros and cons.<p>If you know of other literate programs please post a comment.",
