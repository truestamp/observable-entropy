      "text": "Hey all, new software developer here and am looking to create a project that will help solve a problem and gain me some experience. I was wondering if any of you remix users (or potential remix users) have felt that remix is missing something that could be added by a third party. Whether it is something that could be addressed through a package or if its a monitoring tool that could be developed or a chrome dev tool for debugging and testing. Really anything that comes to mind, I would love to hear it. Thanks for helping out a newbie and giving inspiration!",
