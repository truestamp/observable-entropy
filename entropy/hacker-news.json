      "text": "&quot;Ignorance of the law is no excuse”<p>How can you learn about law and legal to work confidently as a developer? Where do you learn what you need to do due diligence for your projects?<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer, and it&#x27;s hurting my confidence to create projects as a solo developer. With licenses, privacy policies, terms of service, managing user data, compliance, etc; the biggest roadblock to all my projects has been thinking about the legal aspects.<p>Most of the material online worsen my confidence when everything is wrapped around IANAL or &quot;this is not legal advice.&quot;<p>Anecdotally, it seems that most projects with small teams don&#x27;t even bother and just &quot;deploy now, worry later&quot;, like copy pasting some privacy policy from a generator without reviewing it themselves.<p>If you&#x27;re already established, it make sense to just have some dedicated in-house legal department but what about when you&#x27;re starting out? A solution seems to have some dedicate lawyer you can consult, but I&#x27;m under the impression that unless you have some friend who&#x27;s a lawyer, the hourly fees are already more than server costs, killing motivation to even bother bootstrapping innovative ideas.<p>Is there a way to learn how to do legal basics yourself besides going to law school for X years?",
