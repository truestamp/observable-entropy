      "text": "I was thinking of buying AirPods 3, mainly because with AppleCare+ replacements are cheaper then a new pair of cheap headphones(AUD$45). I found that the price per fix is kind of misleading because they charge AUD$20 postage so a fix is actually $65, this is odd as everything on the Apple site is free shipping(but it&#x27;s not too strange, they probably would rather you get it checked at an Apple store).<p>The real bizarre thing about AppleCare+ is there seems to be absolutely no way of finding out how much it costs without first buying AirPods? There&#x27;s no price anywhere. The link for AppleCare+ for headphones gives an error 404. To even see that it actually exists I have to enter the AppleCare shop as though I want to buy AppleCare for some other device. I thought that perhaps the product is discontinued, but they advertise every AirPods as coming with 7 days free AppleCare+.<p>It seems like when AppleCare for AirPods first came out it cost $45, is it possible that it now costs way more and they deliberately hide it to make customers think it&#x27;s a good deal? Perhaps they don&#x27;t want people to buy AppleCare+ because it&#x27;s a good deal? I don&#x27;t understand how this practice makes any sense. I probably won&#x27;t buy them if I can&#x27;t find out how much AppleCare+ costs.<p>Also if anyone knows how much it costs in Australia, I&#x27;d appreciate if you&#x27;d let me know!",
