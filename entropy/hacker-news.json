      "text": "Hi All,<p>I&#x27;ve created a Free Kubernetes Learning course that I hope some of you will find useful, especially with Kubecon next week.  Created this based on personal frustrations that I had when learning Kubernetes at first.<p>I found that some courses&#x2F;technical resources gave a theoretical viewpoint of Kubernetes but didn&#x27;t demonstrate these components directly in use.  I also found that particular entities like the pause container were often overlooked, even though they were clearly shown in the video&#x2F;course terminal output.<p>For this course I go with a slightly different approach.  We configure our container runtime, setup a simple CNI driver and install Kubernetes.  Then, we explore general usage.  After that, we uncouple each component and re-attempt to run the same examples.  As we do this we see where it does&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t work and bring online each component with an explanation of what it is and why it&#x27;s important.<p>I Attended Kubecon back in 2019 on a Diversity scholarship.  I have a type of Motor Neurone Disease which fortunately unlike most, is not terminal but it affects my walking (I use Nordic Walking poles for extra stability).  At the time, I pledged as part of my application to make a free Kubernetes course and to give back to the community.<p>It took me longer than I anticipated but, here it is.<p>Thanks for your time.<p>James Spurin\n@jamesspurin",
