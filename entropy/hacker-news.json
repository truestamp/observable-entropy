      "text": "Hey HN - spending time adding machine learning to your product is almost never worth it for startups.<p>Formulating the problem, managing training data, training models, serving them, etc... for a 10% increase in some metric just isn&#x27;t worth the time. Using rules + heuristics, although not optimal, does a pretty good job for a long time.<p>There should be a better solution between rules &amp; hardcore ML -- an 80&#x2F;20 way to add ML to any product. Just slap it on top of the rules you already have, get that 10% gain, and never think about it again.<p>I built an API that does just that. It&#x27;s used by a few companies to do everything from shopping cart recommendations to personalized landing page hero text. It takes 10-20 lines of code to implement.<p>I&#x27;d love for anyone in the HN community to kick the tires on this and let me know what you think. Docs are at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.banditml.com&#x2F;.<p>You can even use this api key immediately without an account to test it out: 1e9d8ef7948e545d25f189addb17dae1.",
