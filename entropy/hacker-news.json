      "text": "Long story short I needed to buy some software for business from Google for Android. Not sure what exactly I would need I&#x27;ve decided to buy play store gift card from Amazon. Few moments after completing a purchase I received an email that my account is suspended and I would need to click this and do that to get it reinstated. Clicking ended up in never ending circle. So I called them - the guy grilled me for a while and then said that he has to submit all data to higher ups and can do nothing himself and I should wait for email. At this point I was pretty much fuming.<p>To their credit few hours later email did come telling that account has been reinstated. I did have to enter credit cards again though.<p>Phew. I went to internets and read about the subject and people say that buying gift card is considered scum &#x2F; laundering and is ground for account suspension.<p>Now comes a question - if the above is true then why bother selling those in a first place?",
