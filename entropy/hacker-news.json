      "text": "So have been going through my e-mail archive and there are a bunch of what I&#x27;d call &quot;interesting&quot; e-mails from google about changes in policy<p>on 28 Apr 2011 22:23:41 -0400 (no actual date header in email it seems, so going by received header, does have what appears to be a valid DKIM header)<p>Hello,<p>We recently announced upcoming changes to the maximum number of users for Google Apps. We want to let you know that, as a current customer, the changes will not affect you.<p>As of May 10, any organization that signs up for a new account will be required to use the paid Google Apps for Business product in order to create more than 10 users. We honor our commitment to all existing customers and will allow you to add more than 10 users to your account for yucs.org at no additional charge, based on the limit in place when you joined us.<p>Sincerely,<p>The Google Apps Team<p>on Sat, 08 Dec 2012 02:18:41 +0000 they sent<p>Here&#x27;s some important news about Google Apps--but don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s no  \nneed for you to take any action. We just want you to know that we&#x27;re making  \na change to the packages we offer.<p>Starting today, we&#x27;re no longer accepting new sign-ups for the free version  \nof Google Apps (the version you&#x27;re currently using). Because you&#x27;re already  \na customer, this change has no impact on your service, and you can continue  \nto use Google Apps for free.<p>Should you ever want to upgrade to Google Apps for Business, you&#x27;ll enjoy  \nbenefits such as 24&#x2F;7 customer support, a 25 GB inbox, business controls,  \nour 99.9% uptime guarantee, unlimited users and more for just $5 per user,  \nper month.<p>on (copy pasted wrong date, looking to find it, will update when found)<p>Today, we announced that we&#x27;re changing our name from Google Apps for  \nBusiness to Google Apps for Work.<p>Over the years, the size of our team, the breadth of our offerings and our  \ncommitment to business customers have all increased substantially.  \nOrganizations of all shapes and sizes, from one-person start-ups to  \ncorporations with over 200,000 people, are using Google for work. To  \nreflect this change, we&#x27;ve renamed our products.<p>To be clear, only our name is changing. The product experience remains the  \nsame, as does our commitment to bringing you the best tools to run your  \nbusiness.",
