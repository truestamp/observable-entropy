      "text": "I would be grateful for help in assessing the risks, in amount (probability, conditions&#x2F;demographics) and details (what may happen, for how long), of the vaccines (foremostly of the vaccines, then of COVID-19) against the current in-focus epidemic.<p>Many voices invite to a &quot;Cost&#x2F;Risk&#x2F;Benefit&quot; analysis systematically forgetting that it is supposed to be based on numbers.<p>The consequences of interest are those of mid-long duration - what lasts only a few days is assumed as &quot;endurable&quot;. What may instead last for many weeks, months etc. is relevant.<p>I have for now only directly checked the data from the USA VAERS system: it seems fairly reliable in terms of the data contained (it is reported to be mostly compiled by medical practitioners), but is very probably less reliable in terms of real amounts - reporting is voluntary. It would be useful to compare it to systems with &quot;active monitoring&quot; in which the compilation from practitioners is mandated. For the moment, I could only access the data from VAERS and could not enter other sources (e.g. the European and the Australian one). Already in the VAERS it does not seem immediate to discriminate the expected first-days side effects from the long duration ones.<p>I also do not know which repository about the consequences (condition, probability, duration, demographics...) of actual infection could be the most reliable. In fact, even calculating the odds of infection does not seem trivial.",

      "text": "The word “research” tends to evoke ideas of long, expensive academic careers you have to put in until you can be considered qualified for industrial R&amp;D type roles. But security research seems to be orthogonal to many fields that tend to focus less on  credentialism and more on proven past ability. It’s not uncommon software devs, other security roles, etc. to be able to break into to their respective fields self taught so is it possible for security research roles?<p>If so, how difficult is it to self teach this sort of stuff and how long would someone with a cursory understanding of exploits, security, etc. to be “ready” for a industrial role in this field. I get that’s a very open question, with widely varied answers based on individuals, but for comparison, it doesn’t seem to take software developers that show existing aptitude for the field very long to have the potential for productivity in a industrial setting. Hell there are entire industries around pumping out new programmers in 6mo-1y, and while they may not all be top of the line, if good at all, getting your foot into the door seems to be the biggest step into separating those who are and getting them into the right track.",
