      "text": "My 5-year old daughter asked me a few days back, how the fist human came to be.<p>I gave the Darwinian answer: &quot;She (aribrary gender) was born from an ape mother.&quot;<p>Today, she came back, after obviously having thought about this, and asked: &quot;Who was the father of the children of the first human?&quot;<p>Now this was more difficult. We could just say that anyone born to her species born after day X were human, and those before were apes. But if we chose to use genotypes or phenotypes to determine this, &quot;she&quot; may very well have mated with someone just short of meeting the criteria, and may also have had children that qualified as &quot;apes&quot;.<p>What do I answer the 5-year-old?",
