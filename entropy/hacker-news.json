I am learning R for my statistics course, but I am interested in learning Python too.<p>I am wondering if it is feasible to learn Python (~1-2 hours a day) during grad school? My intentions in wanting to learn Python stem from my dreams of starting a startup. Is it unreasonable to have these startup intentions if I am busy with unrelated work?<p>Just want to get some opinion from the HN community, is it worth the effort to learn Python, or would my time be better spent sticking with R and using it for basic statistics for research?",
