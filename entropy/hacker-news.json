All endpoints are behind Nat, so some polling is required.<p>Is there a service that would help me here? SNS almost works, but creating&#x2F;restricting individual queues ad-hoc makes it more work than I want to deal with. Can something else provide a trivial &quot;send(secret, queue name, message)&quot; and &quot;listen(secret, queue)&quot; functionality?<p>I&#x27;m a little tempted to just use Telegram for this.",
