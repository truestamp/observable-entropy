      "text": "So, I&#x27;m a huge Duolingo fan, with a 1024 day streak and paying for Plus and all that jazz. I&#x27;ve found it very useful when supplemented with TV and later chatting&#x2F;speaking with people.\nI wanted to find something similar for math, just to review and keep myself fluent because I want to eventually go deeper with physics, so I searched around and all I could find was Brilliant.\nI did a bunch of the samplers they offer but this didn&#x27;t really give me an idea of whether it&#x27;s good or not, I really wish they had a trial or ad supported version or something like that because they basically strong arm you into putting down $100 unless you want to pay 2x or 4x per month for shorter time periods... I just don&#x27;t know if I want it yet or not, so I can&#x27;t justify that.\nWhat is other people&#x27;s experience with this thing? Are there alternatives that are similar to Duolingo (keeps a streak, is gamified, cut graphics, with bite-sized levels, etc.)?",
