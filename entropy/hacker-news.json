      "text": "Just released v0.3.2 of Hibiki HTML (lots of new changes and features)!<p>The biggest, from the feedback I got on HN, is that Hibiki HTML is now\nlicensed under the standard MPL v2 (Mozilla Public License v2, OSI\napproved), and is able to be integrated into any project (free,\ncommercial, or (A)GPL) without any fear over a non-standard license.<p>I&#x27;ve also released a new Bulma UI control library for Hibiki -\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;libs.hibikihtml.com&#x2F;test-bulma.html .  It features buttons,\ntabs, menus, modals, great looking form inputs and controls, and a\nsimple data-table control with built in sorting and pagination!  There\nare also Hibiki HTML library wrappers for rendering markdown and code\nhighlighting.<p>Hibiki HTML is a great middle ground between vanilla HTML and full-on\nJS frameworks like React or Vue.  You can add dynamic functionality,\nreuseable components, and backend REST calls in a <i>single HTML file</i>.\nNo tools to install, no JavaScript stack to configure,\nno build process, and no need to be a JavaScript expert.<p>It works works great for embedding into backend\nservers (or scripts), tools to interact with REST APIs, or\nadding dynamic functionality to static sites.<p>I&#x27;d love to to hear and answer any feedback, questions, or comments.\nIf you have a project you&#x27;d like to use Hibiki HTML on, I&#x27;m also happy\nto lend a hand or build out additional functionality or components you\nmight need.<p>* Interactive Tutorial - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;playground.hibikihtml.com&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;<p>* Bulma UI Controls - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;libs.hibikihtml.com&#x2F;test-bulma.html<p>* Github - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dashborg&#x2F;hibiki<p>* Discord - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;zbWV6ueED7",
