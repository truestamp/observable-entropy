      "text": "Is there some deep trouble going on at Spotify that&#x27;s preventing them from releasing useable software?<p>Spotify on my MacBook has recently become so unstable that I am going to have to remove it permanently. It constantly messes with my audio settings so that Zoom and all other apps stop working when it&#x27;s running. My Airpods randomly disconnect whenever Spotify is running and I have to restart to stabilize them again. Every time I restart my computer Spotify hangs and has to be force killed.<p>I have a relatively recent MacBook pro (But not M1) and standard setup, nothing crazy.<p>This is getting to the point where I am going to cancel my subscription with them but I wanted to see if other people are having similar issues or it&#x27;s just me?<p>Edit: I have tried all the standard things to troubleshoot, reinstalled it, reinstalled audio drivers and reset things etc... Nothing helps.",
