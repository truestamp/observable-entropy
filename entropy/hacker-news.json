      "text": "For a couple of years now, I&#x27;ve been noticing places where I think my team could benefit from some reasonable&#x2F;pragmatic application of &quot;Formal Methods&quot; of software design, and have been wanting to act as an advocate for that. My job gives me a budget to spend on continued education &#x2F; professional development, and I think getting a foundational understanding of Formal Methods could be useful (at least so I can explore how much &#x2F; which methods would be useful to us).<p>Does anyone have any recommendations for foundational &#x2F; overview type courses on FMSD? Interested in free courses, of course, but also looking for something to spend my employers money on, so paid courses are welcome. Thank you!",
