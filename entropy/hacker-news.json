      "text": "I&#x27;ve been pondering on and off again how best to avoid ending up in some kafkaesque algorithmic loop where your gmail account, domain name, etc. are suddenly blocked by the registrar for unspecified reasons with little to no way to resolve the situation, as has happened to &quot;many&quot; here.<p>I thought Cloudflare would be pretty good, out of the non-enterprise priced options, but even there someone had a really worrying incident recently: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31573854<p>I&#x27;m inclined to think that the buck always stops somewhere, and no place is really safe in this regard, but is there really no way to have some reasonable safeguards for these?\nThe individual domains may be of little value to a registrar, but they&#x27;re potentially enormously valuable to their owners, and the apparent asymmetry of incentives concerns me.<p>Are we just forced to generate noise on HN to resolve such cases or are there any reasonable alternatives out there that offer guarantees about only resorting to blocking&#x2F;deleting domain in extreme cases, and provide the means to escalate without HN outcry?",
