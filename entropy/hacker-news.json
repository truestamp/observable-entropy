      "text": "So I&#x27;ve been freelancing&#x2F;working fully remotely for the last 10+ years, mostly because it allowed me to make 2x more than I could on site in my local area, and it required less effort than going to an office every day.<p>I loved the freedom of it, but now in my mid-30s, I&#x27;m starting to notice how detrimental it was to my social life, skills and status. While I&#x27;m doing OK among other devs, whenever I meet with a doctor, a lawyer, a corporate person, heck even my coach, I&#x27;m envious of how eloquent, confident and composed they are. In contrast with them, I feel like a weirdo, mumbling and struggling to come up with anything interesting to say.<p>A younger me used to think that work was only supposed to support your &quot;passions&quot;, but it turned out these tend to get old, and at some point it&#x27;s your job that really shapes you the most, determines your lifestyle, and your position in the flock. If you&#x27;re an IT nerd spending better part of your life in a cave, well, that&#x27;s who you are, no matter how much you make, what car you drive, etc.<p>Even with hobbies and going out on your own, it&#x27;s really hard to break out of your bubble. They&#x27;re not nearly a replacement for and everyday forced and purposeful interaction with different types of people, especially of a higher social status than yours. Forced on you, but even more importantly, also on them ;)<p>Anyhow, not looking for any specific advice, just wondering if anyone had a similar experience, or maybe a success story to share.",
