      "text": "Friends, I think you are well aware of the noise that photographs of confidential documents have made on the Internet. Every month there are new high-profile scandals, destroyed deals, ruined reputations.<p>We have developed a system to prevent such cases. LeaksID adds invisible marks to any documents (this isn&#x27;t watermarks, it&#x27;s steganography). You can determine who leaked your documents by any photo or a piece of paper document. Many corporations have already integrated our system into their document management systems.\nBut for everyone who needs document security at no high cost, we have created the SaaS solution - LeaksID.com. To protect a small number of documents (50 pages), it is completely free.<p>I would be very grateful to you for any feedback on usability and new features that would be interesting.",
