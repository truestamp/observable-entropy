It&#x27;s become annoying because I have to run the scripts multiple times and weed out the unwanted results.<p>(I&#x27;m also surprised by how many inappropriate words there are that I never knew about. :-))<p>Is there a word list out there somewhere that&#x27;s extensive like an English dictionary, but without this problem? The language needs to be English. Thank you for any tips.",
