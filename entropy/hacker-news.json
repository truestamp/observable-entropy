      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Backblaze for a few years for my home computer. You know how everyone keeps telling you, a backup is only a true backup once you&#x27;ve done at least one restore? Now I know why (silly me).<p>I just got a &quot;Safety Freeze&quot; error [1] - essentially some inconsistency with my backup. Backblaze will not tell me the actual cause of this inconsistency. It&#x27;s possible that some data might be missing - Backblaze doesn&#x27;t tell me though.<p>The official solution is to <i>manually check all files</i> (millions in my case). I also can&#x27;t download a full backup since Backblaze only allows downloads of up to 500GB at once. So my only option is to do a full hard drive restore, costing $189 + customs in Europe, so at the end probably closer to 300â‚¬. But even then I won&#x27;t know if&#x2F;which of my data was corrupted.<p>What bugs me is that the Backblaze desktop software should be able to resolve this - it should be possible to do a hash of all the files that are in the most recent backup, and cross-check it with the hashes of the files on my machine.<p>Not sure what I should do now.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;safety_frozen.html",
