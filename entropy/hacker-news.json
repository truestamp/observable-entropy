      "text": "I want to pick a new programming language that is simple and minimal like C but does not have the type of footguns C has (segmentation faults, double-free issues, etc.)<p>C++, Java, Rust are far from minimal. Go feels minimal but it too has a lot of features compared to C and it has a garbage collector too.<p>Here are some things I am looking for:<p>* Compiles down to machine code.<p>* Does not have the footguns of C.<p>* Simple like C.<p>* Implementations available for all major OSes, at least, Linux, Mac, Windows, *BSDs.<p>After extensive search I got the feeling that it is difficult to find such a language. If I am willing to let go &quot;simple like C&quot;, then it provides a lot of options like Rust, Nim, and all. Just asking here to see if I missed something during my search.",
