      "text": "I have been all in on the Google product suite for a very long time.  From Gmail to Pixel to everything in between.  I haven&#x27;t had any expectations of privacy from the beginning.  While I may not have liked all of Googles methods per se, I have accepted that superior functionality came at a price.  That lack of privacy was the cost of doing business so that isn&#x27;t the issue that is pushing me to part ways.  What has pushed me over the edge is the discovery and realization of how &quot;curated&quot; my news and searches have become.  After comparing my search results for like terms and news with other search engines, and searches when I am logged in to Google and when I am not, I have come to the conclusion that for whatever reason, Google is no longer the best tool for me to search the internet for answers.  Email, search, browser and news aggregation are the main Google services I utilize.  I would love to hear suggestions regarding the best alternatives for Google services.  Thanks.",
