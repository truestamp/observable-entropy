I only use it to chat with a friend but I can contact him over other platforms.\nHowever, I manage a few pages on Facebook (business and hobbies) that I can&#x27;t abandon, unfortunately. What&#x27;s the best course of action I can take?<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking in creating a different profile, set that profile as admin of the pages, and then delete my account. Would that be a bad or good idea? I am not sure if it goes against Facebook TOS and I would be in a big problem if I lose any of the pages I am an admin.",
