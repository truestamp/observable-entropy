      "text": "When I interact with people who have demanding jobs that give them little pay or respect, I feel bad because I&#x27;m younger than they are, but I make much more money doing much more comfortable work.<p>You might say I &quot;deserve&quot; my current place in life. Nothing has been handed to me, and I&#x27;m unusually smart and hard working. But I believe that I was born smart, and I&#x27;ve always had a compulsion to work hard.<p>I feel uncomfortable interacting with people of lower social classes. I don&#x27;t care what they think about me. I just feel bad that they might lack respect or comfort in their work, or that their general life position may be unpleasant.<p>I give rather large tips, but it doesn&#x27;t make me feel better. I usually tell myself that they probably greatly appreciate the jobs that they have and are using it as a stepping stone to achieve their dreams - that makes me feel better. I&#x27;ve also decided to stop avoiding discomfort&#x2F;pain in my life, which makes me feel better.<p>Do you experience this? How do you deal with it?",
