I feel like I need to be careful in how I read something like this, lest the time just be wasted altogether on the forgettable minutiae of history.<p>What&#x27;s your strategy for reading similar books, such that you take something away from it but don&#x27;t waste time on information you&#x27;ll immediately forget?",
