However, I think I have a unique perspective, where I&#x27;m approaching all languages now as ones that can be edited in a spreadsheet GUI (as well as plain text editors and IDEs). If you want to see a (crappyâ€”my video production skills need work) demo of what I mean, one is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0l2QWH-iV3k<p>I&#x27;ve done some Googling around, and found this thread on HN where apparently Sony was encouraging devs to use spreadsheets to write better assembly for the PS3: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12294685<p>Was wondering if anyone out there has experience with things like this, and could share some more leads?<p>Also, if you like PL design check out LangJam this Friday! I&#x27;m excited for it.",
