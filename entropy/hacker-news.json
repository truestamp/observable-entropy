What is going on??<p>To add to the confusion and pane—my iPhone is so fast to pick up on my new network `TP_Link_Extender` while my Mac has yet to react. Would love to speed it up.",

      "text": "Is there a way that any providers use, a standardised way, to create a lot of new email accounts.<p>I&#x27;m moving a few domains&#x27; email accounts from one supplier (Siteground, their recurring fees are huge) to another (Fastmail, or maybe Office 365, [ProtonMail only allow multi-domains on their expensive professional account]) but I&#x27;m not looking forward to moving about 20-50 accounts, per domain, from one email system to another [the domains are staying put, web hosting is being handled separately, just the email accounts are moving].<p>Is there an easier way? Do any providers support it?<p>I&#x27;m not relishing manually setting up even just a handful of domains with lists of redirects and mailboxes for all my family members and the couple of small businesses I&#x27;ve been managing. If I decide a month down the line it&#x27;s not working, it seems a lot to go through to move all the &quot;domains&quot; again (i.e. setup email accounts at another provider that use my domains and have named email addresses -- eg person.1@example.com, person.one@example.com, nickname1@example.com, ... etc., and then all those for example2.com, example3.com, example4.com, each set of email addresses going to a single person).<p>There seems to be a lot of lock-in because of the difficulty of moving email accounts. Am I doing it wrong? Should I just relent and try and use catch-alls and filter it client side? Any advice?",
