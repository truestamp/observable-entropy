      "text": "Hi all,<p>I&#x27;m trying my hand at minimising mouse usage as much as possible.<p>I do all my coding in a terminal (I won&#x27;t say which I use between vim and emacs but suffice to say my editor of choice frees me from relying on a mouse).<p>I also use terminal programs for playing music, movies, and chat (cmus, mpv, and irssi respectively).<p>I&#x27;m wondering how far I can push this &quot;no mouse&quot; approach - for example browsing the web, file system navigation, and other common tasks.<p>What program(s) would you recommend for the above?<p>I&#x27;m hoping to use terminal programs for everything (not sure if that&#x27;s the correct terminology, but basically I&#x27;m looking for terminal-interfaces that will play nicely with my theme&#x27;s colour and transparency settings).<p>Thanks in advance for the tips! ^_^",
