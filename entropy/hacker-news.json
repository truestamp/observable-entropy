      "text": "Game Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;playpass.link&#x2F;lMuxC1<p>With the huge interest generated by Wordle, our company has created a Wordle inspired game with the ability to make custom words as our co-worker posted the news here (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31106825). As a PM, I looked at the user funnel’s data and found the following issues below; Players who comes into the game have shown interest in this type of games Puzzle Start (from Game Start) All Users =&gt; 80.1% Players come from Share =&gt; 100% But players (coming from shared links?) are dropping out of the game without completing a row One row complete (from Game Start) All users =&gt; 17.7% Players come from Share =&gt; 70% Puzzle Complete All users =&gt; 11.80% Players come from Share =&gt; 70% It seemed like the best way to make a player finish the Puzzle is to make them complete at least one row. We have come up with the following Hypothesis and test to see if our Hypothesis is correct.\nHypothesis: Increase in 1st row complete will increase Puzzle Completion rate; looking at the funnel analysis, increase rate of Puzzle completion will be similar to increase rate of 1 row Complete rate. Hint word will appeal on the first row if player does not complete the 1st row Hint word will have one letter which is in the answer but in the different location<p>We ran the test for about a week and got the results below: One row complete =&gt; Saw 34.2% improvement Puzzle Complete =&gt; 32.1% improvement",
