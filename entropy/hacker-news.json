      "text": "I’ve got quite a large number of demo projects on GitHub now. I seem to attract a lot of students looking to do their final projects - I’m happy with this - the whole point of publishing code is to help other people learn. But there is a small minority who obviously don’t have the necessary background or skills to approach the work and need remedial support to even get to the point of being able to run the code.<p>How can I filter these people out?<p>This may seem harsh, but these people also seem to be the most obnoxious  and will post everywhere they can find me demanding my help.<p>I have a lot of empathy for them - they’ve obviously seen a project and though “hey, I can copy this and make a voice controlled robot” and then find they are completely stuck and failing - but if I gave them the support they need I’d have no time to do anything else.",

If I do the same with my nintendo gameboy advance, the device still boots up and has almost full charge even after a year of sitting in a drawer, powered off. Why is this happening?

When you have a production system running, every now and then there are requirements to made a DB update because of some bug in the code, or for some use cases which were not thought of earlier. How do you handle such updates?<p>The common way I know is the access is given to a small number of trusted people who make the updates. Are there any other ways or best practices such that the small set of people don&#x27;t end up becoming bottlenecks, apart from the potential risk of abuse of trust.",
