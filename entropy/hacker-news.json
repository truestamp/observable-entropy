      "text": "I was recently asked, &quot;Is Elixir a good first language for someone to learn who has never done (serious) programming before?&quot;  After thinking for a minute, I realized that at some point in the last 20 - 25 years I really lost touch with this area.<p>My first language was C, and I did and still do think that was a fantastic first language because you can start very simply and don&#x27;t have to learn a ton of programming concepts prior to writing some code.  In my experience, learning to code is much more likely to succeed if you can write <i>something</i> (even hello world) and iterate on it.  For example, working with people learning Java as their first language, they really struggle because you can&#x27;t really do a hello world without encountering objects, classes, static keyword, public&#x2F;private, and other things.<p>I love functional programming and Elixir, but I do worry that it has a few things like that to learn that might be a barrier to entry for a brand new programmer.  Since I started procedurally and years later learned OOP, and then after that learned functional, I have so much baggage that I&#x27;m not sure I can weigh Elixir as a first language.<p>There&#x27;s also the obvious, &quot;what do you want to do with it?&quot; question that matters.  For example if you want to write frontend SPAs or mobile apps you have less flexibility.  In this case however, that&#x27;s largely irrelevant.<p>Is there anyone here who learned Elixir as their first (or first serious) language who can comment on this?  Or is there anybody who started with a functional language and&#x2F;or a lisp or similar who can comment?",
