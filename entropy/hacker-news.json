Pete claimed he had a computer science degree and was a developer in order to entice people to join the conference. He said he was one of us. He listed such on his Linkedin profile in the link above.<p>People called his alma mater who said he didn&#x27;t graduate with any degree in computer science. It was complete bullshit. Google and Alexa were notified he was scamming engineers and developer. Google and Alexa have done NOTHING except only now are they leaving the Modev production and trying to partner with someone else to do the Voice Talks works and are sharing a RFP to get off of him, meanwhile his stuff is still being sponsored by Big Tech.<p>Basically Google and Alexa allowed this guy to go around and claim he was a developer with a computer science degree that he didnt have in order to get developers to join his conference, and it was all a lie. I don&#x27;t know what kind of protection there is for engineers but I find it insulting that Google and Alexa knew this and did nothing, perpetuating the fraud, honestly.",
