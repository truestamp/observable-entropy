I&#x27;m the only engineer at the moment working solely on our backend - whilst the rest of the team are focused on app&#x2F;frontend development, with the occasional help out on backend tickets.<p>Our team constantly gets praise from our founders for our app delivery and the quality of the consumer-facing aspect of our software, but a coworker of mine recently let me know of some comment one of our founders made about &quot;X not pulling the same weight as the app devs.&quot;. My coworker assured me they corrected this person, but nonetheless it&#x27;s still a major cause of concern for me.<p>I&#x27;d love to get some advice on what visibility changes those of you in this situation made (particularly ones for the office as we&#x27;re all heading back regularly quite soon).",

Blind and Levels.fyi have plenty of data on $300k+ FAANG pay packages. There’s plenty of hiring going on outside the hotspots at the $120-160k level. But are there non-FAANG jobs (ie sane hiring process, small teams) that pay senio engineers $200-300k? If so, where are they?",
