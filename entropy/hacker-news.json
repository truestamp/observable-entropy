      "text": "Hi HN, When I code I&#x27;m pretty accurate with my typing with hardly any typos and I can code at quite a speed, however when I type long form (even this post) every second word or so is mistyped. Does anyone have any tips on how to fix this?<p>People have said I might be dyslexic, even though I can read really well. I can&#x27;t hand-write though, I have to write in upper case, otherwise it&#x27;s illegible. I&#x27;m also left-handed.<p>I&#x27;m also on the autism spectrum, and thinking about getting properly tested for that to find out how bad.<p>I can talk for hours though, albeit slightly rambling, so the creativity is definitely there.<p>What I want to do is write more long form texts both fact and fiction, but I&#x27;m being put off knowing my typing accuracy is so bad. I see other people typing at speed with hardly any errors, and I get disheartened.<p>What have other people done, or suggest, to tackle this issue?",
