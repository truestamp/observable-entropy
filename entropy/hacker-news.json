It works well for my need and is an inexpensive way to get a 2x 5K monitor setup (total cost: 2100 EUR)<p>I am considering getting a M1 mac mini and use my 2 current imac27 retina as external monitors. My plan is to get a cheap small monitor for the mac mini, then use Barrier to use the imacs as external monitors.<p>Anyone here has gone that route?",
