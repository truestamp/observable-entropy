I&#x27;ve used Java, Python, and PHP professionally as well, but Javascript&#x2F;Typescript is by far my most well understood.<p>In JavaScript, no one is supposed to use the Boolean object constructor (new Boolean()). It is singularly unhelpful, and usually does the opposite of what you want. I&#x27;ve never seen a case for it.<p>Please correct me if there is some arcane reason to use it.<p>Do other languages have features like this that newbies might try to use once before getting burned and then literally never touch again no matter how advanced they get?<p>Are there interesting stories for why those features exist?",
