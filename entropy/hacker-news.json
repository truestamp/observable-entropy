      "text": "I sometimes spot colleagues making design decisions that seem really bad to me. A common pattern is building something that already exists in much better form as open source software. I usually try to get them to realize the error themselves by asking questions like &quot;how does this compare to open source library X&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t always work. How do you deal with things like this, keeping in mind that I&#x27;m not all knowing and could be wrong but also feel a responsibility to protect the larger organization from bad tech.",

      "text": "Hey HN, I’m Jordan cofounder of Humanloop (YC S20) and I’m excited to show you Programmatic — an annotation tool for building large labeled datasets for NLP <i>without manual annotation</i>.<p>Programmatic is like a REPL for data annotation. You:<p><pre><code>  1. Write simple rules&#x2F;functions that can approximately label the data\n  2. Get near-instant feedback across your entire corpus\n  3. Iterate and improve your rules\n</code></pre>\nFinally, it uses a Bayesian label model [1] to convert these noisy annotations into a single, large, clean dataset, which you can then use for training machine learning models. You can programmatically label millions of datapoints in the time taken to hand-label hundreds.<p>What we do differently from weak supervision packages like Snorkel&#x2F;skweak[1] is to focus on UI to give near-instantaneous feedback. We love these packages but when we tried to iterate on labeling functions we had to write a ton of boilerplate code and wrestle with pandas to understand what was going on. Building a dataset programmatically requires you to grok the impact of labeling rules on a whole corpus of text. We’ve been told that the exploration tools and feedback makes the process feel game-like and even fun (!!).<p>We built it because we see that getting labeled data remains a blocker for businesses using NLP today. We have a platform for active learning (see our Launch HN [2]) but we wanted to give software engineers and data scientists a way to build the datasets needed themselves and to make best use of subject-matter-experts’ time.<p>The package is free and you can install it now as a pip package [2]. It supports NER &#x2F; span extraction tasks at the moment and document classification will be added soon. To help improve it, we&#x27;d love to hear your feedback or any success&#x2F;failures you’ve had with weak supervision in the past.<p>[1]: We use a HMM model for NER tasks, and Naive-Bayes for classification using the two approaches given in the papers below:\n   Pierre Lison, Jeremy Barnes, and Aliaksandr Hubin. &quot;skweak: Weak Supervision Made Easy for NLP.&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2104.09683\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2104.09683</a> (2021)\nAlex Ratner, Christopher De Sa, Sen Wu, Daniel Selsam, Chris Ré. &quot;Data Programming: Creating Large Training Sets, Quickly&quot; <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1605.07723\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1605.07723</a> (NIPS 2016)<p>[2]: Our Launch HN for our main active learning platform, Humanloop –  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23987353\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23987353</a><p>[3]: Can install it directly here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.programmatic.humanloop.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;quick-start\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.programmatic.humanloop.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;quick-star...</a>",
