      "text": "This question might&#x27;ve been asked a few times here, but I&#x27;ve added my personal spin to help be more specific.<p>This is not a &quot;I want to become a career developer after many years in an unrelated career&quot; situation. This is &quot;I tried building my dev career for 10 years and want to (almost completely) start over&quot;.<p>I have held multiple jobs as a contract web developer, doing sporadic PHP and Ruby work. While I&#x27;m not exactly a stranger to cubicles and meeting rooms, my position as a temp worker really doesn&#x27;t allow me to grow or make very meaningful contributions to a company.<p>In addition, I don&#x27;t get compensated well (US citizen for context). Most I&#x27;ve made in a single year is $55k gross. Almost all is 1099 work<p>Back to the problem I want to figure out, I know I have a difficult road ahead, what with 2.5 years unemployment and sporadic contract work. Over a thousand job applications and zero offers. I have no interest in trying to run a business. My priority is financial stability (never had 401k or company health insurance) and having a more &quot;mainstream&quot; software engineer career.<p>(I&#x27;ll also need to rebuild my network almost from scratch as my former colleagues do not reply to my inquiries about jobs anymore. It&#x27;s kind of difficult with lockdowns still putting IRL meetups on hold, but I&#x27;m part of a few tech professional chat groups.)<p>The usual route for a CS student is to maintain good grades, participate in research, academic publishing and extracurriculars to help them get good internships, and one of them may convert to a FT job, all in a few years.<p>I am trying to construct a similar &quot;self-taught&quot; version plan of that. Take those gradual steps over a span of 2-3 years. Complete some similar bodies of work that gets the large companies want to interview me, and hopefully get a couple offers lined up.<p>I&#x27;m not asking for shortcuts. I just want to expand my options beyond just doing interview prep and digging into my network, which after 2 years without a single &quot;yes&quot;, feels like I&#x27;m beating a dead horse.",

      "text": "This challenge has been in the back of my mind for a while and I can&#x27;t crack it.<p>There are many scenarios to explore this, but let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re a presidential department tasked with recording a meeting in a way that can be later verified. (We could also look at evidence gathering where the person gathering has the legal right and technological ability to do anything. They&#x27;re fundamentally the same problem)<p>We can&#x27;t rely on internet access (that would be too easy because we could just send a request to a server).<p>We can&#x27;t rely on standard file metadata because it can be forged.<p>[&quot;Mains hum&quot;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mains_hum) has been helpful for some things, but since the data is public someone could fake it by adding the expected hum later.<p>The only thing I can think of is to have a reasonably up-to-date blockchain on-device, then add a file&#x27;s hash as a transaction. I still don&#x27;t think it could store timestamp in a verifiable way but it would at least tell you the sequence that files were added (which is hopefully the sequence they were taken)<p>Has anyone actually solved this problem?",
