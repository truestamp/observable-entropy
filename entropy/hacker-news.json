Then it let me submit and then locked my account.<p>Now I had to give them my ID or they will permanently disable my account in 30 days.<p>I am not a US citizen, I am an EU citizen. There is no reason they can require this information - happy to hear what type of GDPR or other request I can file to get them to remove my birth date and my ID which I just submitted.",
