      "text": "I booked an appointment and went to the Apple store for a battery replacement a couple of months ago for my Macbook Pro. Before this I used to have the type you could replace yourself. I didn&#x27;t realize until I spoke to the store employee that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it then and there. I was told it needs to be sent away for at least one week.I can&#x27;t do that so I did not get it done. So it&#x27;s been two months and unfortunately I have to used it plugged in always and I&#x27;m starting to realize I&#x27;ll never be able to get the battery replaced unless there&#x27;s a same day service or I buy a second computer and sync it with my data and use it while the other one is getting a battery replacement. I&#x27;m curious how everyone else handles this situation, is same day service available from Apple in different locations or do people use a third party service?",
