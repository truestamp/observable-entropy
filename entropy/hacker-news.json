Lying on a pillow on the bed usually reduces the pain, but it&#x27;s harder to type things that way. I even thought about getting an iPad arm for my bed so that I can do my readings while resting on the bed, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good idea as it&#x27;d probably make the back muscles even weaker.",
