      "text": "I got a $750 bill for FaceTiming a bumble match in South Africa from the US. (She claims she used to date Elon Musk, but that’s a diff story).<p>This was over wifi and was a FaceTime call.<p>Everything I can read on the Internet says International FaceTime calls are always free - they are just data.<p>The rep I spoke with 1) refunded me the charges snd taxes. But told me as a matter of policy, if you are making an international FaceTime call via wifi, and “the wifi is slow”, AT&amp;T will shift to data and they will detect it’s an international call and bill you as if it’s a regular international cell call.<p>I triple confirmed this and got it in writing from the rep.<p>This seems, um, criminal.<p>At most my wifi dropping on a FaceTime call should be a regular data useage when I’m calling from the US.<p>Thoughts?",
