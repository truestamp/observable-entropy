      "text": "I guess a lot of people here already know this, and in general I don&#x27;t expect a lifetime license to be actually &#x27;lifetime&#x27;, but I saw the worst example I&#x27;ve seen so far today.<p>Just over a year ago I bought an emojipicker for mac (getmumu.com) that claimed to have a &#x27;lifetime license&#x27;. It&#x27;s a neat little tool and I&#x27;ve used it daily. Now I got a new mac and I tried to transfer it over, only to find out that it&#x27;s rebranded from &quot;Mumu&quot; to &quot;Mumu X&quot; and 5x&#x27;d in price.<p>After hunting through the website I found the tiny &quot;get old version&quot; in the footer. I entered my license key and was told it was already used. I wrote to the support email and was told that &quot;Mumu&quot; was discontinued and &quot;Mumu X&quot; was a new app that I&#x27;d have to buy it again.<p>&gt; And note that “lifetime” means it would work on the lifetime of the app, not the lifetime of the customer.<p>Yeah, I understand it&#x27;s &quot;lifetime of the app&quot; but adding an &quot;X&quot; to the name and a few minor features and then not letting me transfer my old app to a new machine leaves a really bad taste.<p>&#x2F;rant.",
