      "text": "I&#x27;m 50 and run a small (but moderately successful) one-person SAAS business with yearly revenues &gt; $120K.  Like any business, I have various bank accounts, cloud accounts, API accounts, Stripe, credit cards, business registrations, email services, etc... that pretty much only I know about to make things work.  I also have my entire codebase of my site (happens to be ASP.NET CORE C#) along with Git, DB Logins, Google Analytics, DNS, etc..etc...  Finally, there is the workflow that is required to run the site - various little tasks need to be done each day, customer service responses, etc...<p>I really only need to put in a couple hours per day at the job but it doesn&#x27;t make enough money to hire a 2nd person at the moment.<p>So...what if I died tomorrow?  (hypothetically, of course)<p>My wife has a career of her own and is not technologically savvy enough to run my business.<p>I see 2 options:<p>1.  Wind It Down:  Some sort of documentation on all the services&#x2F;accounts that need to be closed.  But this can be tricky for non-techies (ex. just try to cancel an Azure account with various services&#x2F;subscriptions)<p>2.  Transition&#x2F;Succession to another person.  But who would have the various skills to take over my job?  The knowledge base is so specific and, as I said, it won&#x27;t really support another person at the moment.<p>My question is this:\nHow do other single person (or very small team) companies deal with planning for the death of a founder?  Are their any companies, sites, services that can help in this transition (even just to Wind It Down)?",
