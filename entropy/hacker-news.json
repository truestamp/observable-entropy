      "text": "I use Google&#x27;s search products(Google Search, YouTube search etc.) on a daily basis and I see so many reasonable solutions that would significantly improve UX of Google Products but I don&#x27;t understand that product designers and managers at Google are not seeing the same or similar solutions. Google has decades of know-how and unbounded human, financial and computational resources but still they can not figure out things like:<p>My backlog: Google Search: 1. Crawl, index and rank audio content of the web and add it next to Images and Videos in Google Search e.g. &quot;All Images Videos Audio Maps Books More&quot; so I can find and discover audio on Google.<p>2. Add tags in Google Search just like you added tags when searching in Google Images so I can find websites in specific category or in similar category or that I can find similar type of web content.<p>3. Just like GitHub has percentage of languages of source code within source code&#x27;s project page e.g. C++ 90% C 10% add content percentage next to each web page or website result in Search Results e.g. www.mybiologyblog.com Text 70%  Images 20% Videos 10% Audio 0%<p>YouTube: 1. Standardize both web version and mobile version; in web version on channel&#x27;s page I can search channel for videos on mobile I can not.<p>2. Add search option&#x2F;bar in comment section of videos so I can search for information that is relevant and useful to me.<p>3. Add search option&#x2F;bar to playlists so I can search for videos within my playlists.<p>4. Add Google Lens type search solution to YouTube so I can search &quot;within&quot; YouTube videos frame by frame; e.g. let&#x27;s say I watch Wild Animals documentary and I want to skip to lions part, machine learning(AI) can analyse frame by frame and point me to that part of the video(Google has similar solution but only for creators called &quot;Chapters&quot;). And use speech recognition so I have transcript and timestamps for YouTube videos or in anther words try to transcribe and timestamp audio of YouTube videos. Frame by frame and transcription solution are complementary.<p>I have other ideas for YouTube and Google Search in particular but this is my short list. For Google Search my focus is linguistic analysis of websites and analyzing websites&#x27; content(text, images, videos, audio, links etc.) I would not not try to guess what users want like Google does. Users will find good search results if your analysis and presentation of websites and their specifics&#x2F;qualities is good in Search Results page.<p>Also Google Chrome has some web search and web navigation problems that I would like to solve but that I can explain another time.",
