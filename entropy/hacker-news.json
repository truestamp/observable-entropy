I know some people from a club I&#x27;m in but don&#x27;t see them outside of that. It doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;m a computer science major and I don&#x27;t have a lot of interests that CS majors have (anime, video games, social media, etc.) Advice on how to connect better with people?<p>I&#x27;m busy a lot of the time so don&#x27;t think about this. But I&#x27;ve heard everybody talking about Halloween costumes in the past few days and realized I don&#x27;t need one cause I&#x27;ll be sitting inside alone on Halloween. I&#x27;d like to start fixing this but don&#x27;t know how.",
