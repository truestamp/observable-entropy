I&#x27;m thinking of the huge population of us driving for many hours every day and working in gyms etc..  There are lists like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bookauthority.org&#x2F;books&#x2F;best-computer-science-audiobooks, but they tend not to be instructional or introductory.   Do you know of any audio books that actually &quot;speak&quot; the code?  I feel there has to be a huge market for this, but it is very difficult to find much of anything.",
