The pool of jobs I can fit gets smaller every year because I&#x27;m not a very good modern front end guy.<p>I&#x27;m not good at animations, responsive layouts, pixel perfection, es6<p>The simplest task now so complicated, many edge cases.<p>Things get deprecated (or sunsetted) so fast.<p>When I open the chrome inspector there&#x27;s 10 new features which I ignore. It&#x27;s too much.<p>I lost confidence to apply for jobs because I don&#x27;t have the will to study the things they will test me for.<p>Has anyone made that move from front to back, do you feel it&#x27;s easier?",
