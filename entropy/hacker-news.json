The earliest I remember myself being unable to sleep for 2-3 hours was at the age of 8 or 9 I believe.<p>I am passing my thirty now, and I only remember it was really few times in my adult life when I had good sleep for more than a few month in a row.<p>Anybody else here having lifelong sleep issues?",

      "text": "I&#x27;m a solo entrepreneur with a ~3-year old electron app that makes over $100,000&#x2F;year, that is ever-so-slightly disrupting an entrenched software market with incumbents in the $20-30,000,000&#x2F;year revenue range.<p>I offer a 14-day free trial of my app and sell&#x2F;license it using a mixture of node-machine-id to register computers and JWT as the actual license signing. Users often register multiple email addresses to effectively get multiple 14-day free trials.<p>I don&#x27;t currently enforce a number of times a computer can be &quot;registered&quot; in my system, and because of these lax rules I am seeing a lot of really interesting patterns. And by interesting I mean I suspect my competitors are somehow funding click fraud against my ads.<p>For example, I can see the same computer registered 27 times over the last year (every 14 days) to 27 different email addresses and widely differing IPs. However, when I run the IPs through online tools to analyze where they&#x27;re coming from, it&#x27;s almost always some kind of VPN via Amazon.<p>I fear that if I clamp down on how many times a user can register a computer for a free trial that the click fraud folks might know that I know... When I first saw these patterns I emailed about 30 of the addresses thinking that it could be a real user and offered them a free license - no reply.<p>Another thought I had was to build in a much more intrusive analytics feature that would only activate when the computer was registered &gt;X times, offering me the ability to actually see if the software is being used. I even thought of adding something like Intercom so I could message these users real-time and offer them $X,000 USD for divulging who is paying them... something, anything.<p>I currently use ClickCease and the &quot;detection rate&quot; is about 10% of all ad clicks bounce or are VPN traffic, but it seems very concentrated on just two of my ad campaigns that are likely bid on by my competitors.<p>If anyone here specializes in this kind of work, I&#x27;d be happy to chat and compare notes, try out different services, etc.",
