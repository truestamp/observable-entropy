      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on this fun little app for a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve been inspired by Wordle, but I found it a bit too intense and competitive, so I wanted a daily &quot;zen&quot; app to play with my friends and family, and I came up with this!<p>Every day, a new random shape and colour palette is generated. Draw what you see, relax and have fun. I&#x27;ve been playing with my wife and some friends for a week and it&#x27;s quite addictive! Have a go and let me know what you think!<p>Cheers<p>Tom",
