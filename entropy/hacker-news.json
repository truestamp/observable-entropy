      "text": "Hi all\nI&#x27;ve been a great supporter and a fan of the Elixir language and having built huge codebases of my side projects in it, I could feel the robustness and also enjoy the general nature of FP. There were, times when things felt more difficult and challenging compared to Ruby, which was something I was very proficient at before then.<p>Looks like the trend for Elixir Posts and activity on this forum is in the decline now, was wondering what happened to it?! Are people moving away from it already?",
