      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for an expert opinion, having scoured the internet and come up empty. I don&#x27;t believe I ever had Covid. I got my second Pfizer shot in April. I did have a mild immune response (a day of body aches, and a swollen lymph node for a few days, in my neck above the vaccine site).<p>Planning to travel in the next few weeks, and seeking some reassurance that the vaccine &quot;worked&quot;, I took the T-Detect test[1] last week. It came back negative for adaptive T-Cell response. Now, before anyone attacks me for getting this test for the wrong reasons, I&#x27;m just trying to gather as much information as I can. From what I&#x27;ve seen in online chatter, it seems that most people getting this test are getting it to justify avoiding getting a vaccine; I got it for the opposite reason. I went in knowing what it says in the FDA FAQ[2] about the test:<p>&gt; &quot;...the meaning of a positive result in individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine is unknown.&quot;<p>It also says:<p>&gt; &quot;The meaning of a negative test result for individuals that have received a COVID-19 vaccine is unknown.&quot;<p>But obviously, it would be better to have a T-Cell response than not to have one.<p>I know that some <i>antibody</i> tests only show antibodies induced by infection, while specialized others show those induced by the vaccines. But would one expect the same differentiation from a T-Cell test? The company is entirely silent on the subject. I&#x27;d like to form some rough risk assessment on whether a negative result is an indicator that any post-vaccine immunity I had is reduced or gone.<p>Thanks for reading.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.t-detect.com&#x2F;\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;146480&#x2F;download",
