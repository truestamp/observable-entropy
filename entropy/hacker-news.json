      "text": "A number of no-code AI tools for everyday people have sprung up recently. Amazon has their SageMaker Canvas, MS has &quot;AI Builder&quot;, and there are also a few startups that are working on this.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to make of it. On one hand, the idea that non-tecnical people can benefit from some rudimentary classification and time series prediction tools seems incredibly powerful. After all, these are the people with the best domain knowledge for their problems. On the other hand, it seems a bit scary that people without proper understanding of the common pitfalls can build magic-seemig tools that impact their decisions. I&#x27;m also not sure if these people even want to do AI predictions if they don&#x27;t understand the result anyway.<p>Thoughts?",
