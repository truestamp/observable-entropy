Obviously I want to discourage requested-posting like this; is there some structured way that we can do that? One of the things I love about HN is how high the signal-to-noise ratio is relative to...pretty much the rest of the internet.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily call someone out like this, but I want to innoculate HN against this sort of thing.<p>----<p>Hey doches,<p>Not sure if it&#x27;s conventional, but thought I&#x27;d ask anyway.<p>Would you be open to posting about my product on Hacker News?<p>I understand that similar to Product Hunt, HN gives higher priority to users with higher karma. I usually keep up with recent discussions via RSS feed on Feedly, but almost neve post. So I thought I&#x27;d reach out to someone that has authority.<p>My product is called Popupular and it helps embed just about anything into a popup via a Google Chrome extension.<p>[rest of email truncated]",
