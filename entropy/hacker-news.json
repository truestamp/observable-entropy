I want to have a frank discussion about an important subject, not start a political mud-slinging match, so take that elsewhere.<p>Here goes:<p>My startup of ~10 people is outright rejecting all candidates and referrals who are white males. (Yes, really). We just got our series A and have been expanding our personnel, but off the record, management and investors are concerned about the optics of having a company with only white dudes (the company is currently 100% white males). We are still a young enough company where leadership has candor with the rank-and-file engineers such that they feel comfortable being honest with us about this.<p>As a result, in a meeting yesterday afternoon, engineers were specifically told to stop referring candidates from our networks who are white males. They will immediately be rejected.<p>Has anyone else experienced this in a young company? How did it go? How common is this approach generally? Is a policy like this ethical and&#x2F;or legal?<p>Once more, please keep it civil - I know it&#x27;s a controversial subject, but I&#x27;m interested in a thoughtful discussion, not in arguing with trolls. Thanks.",
