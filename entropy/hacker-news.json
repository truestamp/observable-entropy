      "text": "Hey tech folks and technical recruiters. I&#x27;m hoping to get your attention  on the recruitment process.<p>First about me:\nI have been working with a medium range company. I started as a fresh grad and managed to get into team lead role quickly. \nHow did this happen? \nI am pretty good with problem solving and I was never bound to a single language or framework. And whatever was thrown at me, I did that exceptionally.<p>But now like after 3+  years I thought I should move on and I started going into the interviews. That&#x27;s where the problem originated from me.<p>Most of the folks are hiring specialists and would ask nitty gritty details about that specific topic. I know most of the things being asked and have worked on them, but I haven&#x27;t memorised those things like most people use to do. And as said earlier I wasn&#x27;t bound to any language. So didn&#x27;t felt the need to memorise everything.<p>But in interviews they expect me to answer to their every question. And I&#x27;m unable to clear their doubt about me.<p>In my company I&#x27;m known as the guy who gets the work done. Irrespective of the task and also doesn&#x27;t compromise on quality. But but but ....<p>Am I being too dramatic Or am I being interviewed the wrong persons?",
