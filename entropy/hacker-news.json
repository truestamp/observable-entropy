      "text": "There&#x27;s a couple reasons I don&#x27;t feel the term &#x27;technical debt&#x27; is very good:<p>- There&#x27;s an implication that it should be 0, but anyone who&#x27;s ever worked on a large enough project will tell you that any large project will have some technical debt. When you get down to practical implementation there&#x27;s always tradeoffs that have no single clear answer<p>- There&#x27;s this dissonance where the things that are called &#x27;technical debt&#x27; are potentially serious enough to cause problems, but not serious enough for anyone to actually prioritize dealing with them.<p>Using the description &#x27;aesthetics&#x27; makes more sense to me<p>- I think it&#x27;s inherent that aesthetics has a subjective element and that there&#x27;s no way to drive it down to 0 or 100 or whatever.<p>- I think it helps with prioritization by setting the right context. &quot;Removing technical debt&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound like a particularly productive activity, but &quot;improving aesthetics,&quot; while clearly not as high priority as, say, &quot;improving functionality,&quot; at least carries the connotation that something will get improved as a result of the work, even if it&#x27;s something not totally tangible.<p>What are HN&#x27;s thoughts? Are there other words besides aesthetics or technical debt we could&#x2F;should be using?",
