      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on a deep learning side project that needs GPU acceleration at inference time. My inference requests are very bursted, however, so I don&#x27;t need a box to be lying around while waiting for requests. I can stand to wait for a small interval (&lt;1min) before getting results back. Most of the options I&#x27;m seeing either assume full batch processing or persistent hosted boxes that lie around in between requests.<p>Is there anything like heroku dynos that can spin up to process a GPU compute request and then spin back down? What do you use for deep learning side projects?",
