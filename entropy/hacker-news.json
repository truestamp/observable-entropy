      "text": "Lately (last ~6 months) I&#x27;ve transitioned to working on large C++ projects (e.g., LLVM). Naturally compile times are long and a serious barrier to learning&#x2F;iteration. At work I have a beefy workstation (32 core threadripper, 128GB RAM, 2TB ssd) so I don&#x27;t feel the pain <i>as much</i>. I&#x27;d like to get something comparable at home but I don&#x27;t want to spend 5k or whatever. Looking around on ebay you find lots of decommissioned 1U units that are pretty cheap, pretty old, but multicore. Would it be a bad idea to get one of these if I&#x27;m going to use it just to offload compiling (either through vscode remote or by some other means)?",
