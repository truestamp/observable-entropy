      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for someone to come in at a 50% split for a company, Court Bell, that already has its product ready.  The initial product: Each year, millions of Americans fail to appear in court for low-level offenses, &amp; arrest warrants are issued. Studies indicate that text message reminders reduce failure to appear rates by up to 21%[1].  For courts, the costs associated with missed hearings and arrest warrants are quite high but the cost to defendants resulting from missed court dates is even higher.  HearingReminder.com will provide email and text message hearing reminders nationally, free to users, for millions of Americans.<p>I&#x27;m the head of data and application development for a state supreme court.  The National Center for State Courts loves this product but the problem is that getting it into each state&#x2F;county nationally requires a lot of communication.  Courts have the money and this saves them more than it costs.  The code will be open sourced (MIT) and the organization non-profit, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t &quot;do well by doing good.&quot;  Let me know your salary expectations and we&#x27;ll factor that into the pricing.<p>Let me know your questions.  My email is in my profile.  Thanks.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;science.abb6591",
