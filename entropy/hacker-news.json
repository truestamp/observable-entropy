This affected many people.<p>Apart from discovering this months too late, their initial &quot;mitigation&quot; was to do checksum validation on the bash upload script. However, they failed to understand how that works, as they downloaded the checksum from the same URL the bash script was downloaded from. [1]<p>Now they released a new &quot;uploader&quot; where the blog post mentions:<p>&gt; A compiled binary makes it more difficult for code to be modified by a middle man.<p>which only proves their stupidity. Clearly you can replace the binary with a binary that calls the original binary and steals CI secrets too.<p>And their installation instructions from the blog post are as follows:<p><pre><code>    curl -Os https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uploader.codecov.io&#x2F;latest&#x2F;linux&#x2F;codecov \n    chmod +x codecov\n    .&#x2F;codecov -t ${CODECOV_TOKEN}\n</code></pre>\nThat is: a non-versioned URL, and no checksum verification. No lessons learned.<p>How is this company still in business?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codecov&#x2F;codecov-action&#x2F;pull&#x2F;282#issuecomment-823195201",

      "text": "I work for a company that has a few large accounts say 20 and each of these have settings that are kept in a db.<p>These settings are only updated a few times a year or when we add a new account. We currently use a script to update the settings but feels like this is the wrong approach. I&#x27;d much prefer a declarative model. We use terraform to manage our infrastructure and something like that would be ideal but it looks like writing a custom provider is a fair amount of work, or at least more than I was hoping for.<p>Anyone have any suggestions on a better approach?",
