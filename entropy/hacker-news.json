      "text": "I&#x27;ve worked for startups for 10 years and recently joined a FAANG company. Compensation and stability were part of my motivation, but the biggest reason was the assumption that I would be able to work with A+ players solving hard problems.<p>Instead, I&#x27;m on a team that has and horrendous turnover and is staffed with below-average IQ people.<p>This company builds EVERYTHING in house, and the toolset is like going backwards in my career 10 years.<p>If I do want to stick this out and turn this team around, I&#x27;m going to be working nights and weekends for at least a year - there&#x27;s just too much to fix.<p>I&#x27;ve told this to lots of people who work in other division (that I can trust) and they&#x27;ve said the easiest thing is to just accept it as it is and coast. I&#x27;ve never done that in my career and don&#x27;t think I could do that.<p>Has anyone been in the same boat? I&#x27;m told that it becomes easier to switch teams after a year.<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve made a terrible decision and don&#x27;t know what to do next.<p>Any advice is appreciated.",
