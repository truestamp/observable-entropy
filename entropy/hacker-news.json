Most people (me included) keep their day-to-day money in checking accounts, and long-term money (10+ year horizon) in index funds or similar investments. However, if you want to save for a rainy day or a large purchase in the 1-3 year time frame, investments aren&#x27;t appropriate because there&#x27;s money at risk, and existing savings accounts give you pretty much no interest, meaning that your money just shrinks to inflation.<p>At Terrapin we will strip all superfluous operational costs in order to pass a market-leading interest onto you. Additionally, we will make away with the excessive terms and conditions imposed by most savings accounts (e.g. minimum deposits, having to sign-up for unwanted services from the same provider, etc), in order to give you the simplest, most easy-to-use savings account out there.<p>What&#x27;s next?<p>As part of the pre-launch, we&#x27;re inviting users to join the waiting list while development continues in the background. We&#x27;re looking for feedback from this community, both in terms of the landing page and what you would like to get from a service like this.<p>If this is a service you&#x27;d like to use when it goes live, do not hesitate to sign-up for the waiting list :).",
