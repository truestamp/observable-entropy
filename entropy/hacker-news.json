      "text": "Hi! Can you recommend any job portals that are specialized in cross-border remote jobs? I’m not EU or US based, and looks like 90% of remote jobs that I see are only for US or EU citizens. With my 13 years experience in software engineering, mentorship, and people management, fluent English, and decent soft skills, I can&#x27;t get most of the cool jobs I want without relocating to another country. But I’m not willing to relocate. That’s really disappointing.",
