      "text": "So, an introduction of sorts because I thin it matters. From 1985 to 1987 I was a computer science major and was doing really well. It was Fortran back then. I also grew up using a Sinclar ZX81 so programming is not really new to me. But the programming languages sure are as well as the things you can do with it. I make bash scripts al the time for my genetic research so, well, you get it.<p>Also, I was a Network Engineer for Cisco Systems before my Bipolar Disorder made it impossible for me to work. That was in 1999 and I have been living on disability since 2003.<p>I would like to try my hand at programming for Linux applications, possibly MacOS as well. I have a 5th get Thinkpad X1 Carbon running Ubuntu and an M1 MacBook Air.<p>I am also homeless and live in a minivan. I am doing fine with this life but if I could get back into programming and make some extra money it might be something I can use to get myself back into housing after a while and still be able to deal with the Bipolar Disorder.<p>I have been looking at where to start but it is overwhelming. Mostly I am looking for a programming language with some longevity.<p>Thanks for any help!",
