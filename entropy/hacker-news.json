      "text": "Do you subscribe to any streaming service?  If you do, how do you navigate the zillions of songs you might listen to next?<p>If you don&#x27;t, that would be informative too.<p>I recently got 6 months free APple music with airpods, and I&#x27;m trying to understand whether I want to keep subscribing to it.  It&#x27;s nice to have potential access to any song ever, and another thing to actively use it, or to know how to navigate it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I want to stop buying individual musical works, or to stop owning my own collection.  It is conceptually fabulous having an infinitely large musical access.  But that&#x27;s finite if I stop paying the rent on it...<p>Right now, I&#x27;m listening to Talisman, from Moon Safari by Air, from my Mac, prompted by a friend who mentioned that track on his blog.  Then the CD kept going, so now I&#x27;m listening to De Matin La.<p>But if I&#x27;d dialed up Talisman on Apple music, the next song might be something else.  That something else might be determined by... a trillion dollar corporation.  Is that weird?  Good?  Or is it up to me to take this into my own hands?  Or turn it all off and reconnect with silence?<p>I suppose it&#x27;s neither here nor there what I do, as far as anyone else is concerned really. Just an individual choice... but if everyone is in this boat, that&#x27;s kind of a different society to the one I grew up in... isn&#x27;t it?<p>Or is it?",
