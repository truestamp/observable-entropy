I&#x27;ve been looking for easy to understand example code, a pretty printer in Scheme or Lisp that I could adapt and extend but so far have only found academic overview papers from the 80s. It doesn&#x27;t help that most of the stuff is for CommonLisp and uses format. I don&#x27;t have any special string formatting directives and my Lisp is rather different from CL, more akin to XLisp.<p>Do any gray-bearded Lisp programmers remember some old Lisp or Scheme example code that I could study?",
