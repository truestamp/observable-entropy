      "text": "If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned from listening to the Darknet Diaries podcast, it&#x27;s that almost any important piece of computerised equipment is vulnerable to sabotage. Even obscure industrial controllers in oil refineries can be damaged if you&#x27;re familiar with how they work, and you&#x27;re creative enough to nudge them into an unsafe state.<p>So when I see that 64km military convoy outside Kyiv...<p>...full of heavily armoured vehicles and brutal looking military gear...<p>...I naturally wonder: how much of this kit is computerised? How vulnerable is it to malicious code?<p>Instead of taking down websites, could Anonymous reasonably develop a 0-day for the 9K720 short-range tactical ballistic missile system? Does the Koalitsiya-SV 152mm self-propelled howitzer even have Wi-Fi?<p>This is just a random Sunday morning thought, but I&#x27;d be interested if anybody can enlighten me on any of this.",
