In practice that means that I use uMatrix to observe and block third party content and trackers (coupled with uBlock).\nOn almost every popular website that means that I mostly see google tracking (tagmanager, doubleclick, fonts, captacha).<p>But recently I saw that third party elements of improving.duckduckgo.com are appearing every time I visit a link that I clicked in a duckduckgo search.<p>uMatrix doesn&#x27;t categorise it as script or XHR, but simply as &#x27;other&#x27;. And the element seems only to be requested when coming directly from the search result, not like the google stuff that is usually always there.<p>Does someone know what is going on here? Do I need to worry that ddg is becoming the next google?",
