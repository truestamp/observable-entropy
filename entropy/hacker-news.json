      "text": "Hi! I am Dr. Leah Houston. I am an emergency physician (MD) and after 10 years of practice across the US, I realized our $3.9T healthcare system is fundamentally broken to the point that we need to decentralize it. In 2020 we raised $650K from a crowdfund of almost 400 doctors who also recognized this need. In 2021 we soft launched our mobile decentralized identity app to the iOS and Android app stores, and we are growing.<p>We are seeking a true technical co-founder to help to execute on this vision. What is a DAO? Decentralized Autonomous Organization - we believe it is the individual doctors who should build the healthcare system of the future: not centralized governments or private entities such as insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. Current centralized systems we have the potential to usurp include Doximity (centralized social app with a current market cap of $14B), insurance companies (centralized “payments” systems that actually pocket the $ and don’t pay the doctors), EHR companies (that own control and sell patient data without their knowledge or consent), credentialing and physician data industry ($5B) and many more healthcare stakeholders.<p>If you want to join us on this mission learn more here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hpec.io&#x2F;about-us (the Doctors DAO) and here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evercred.com&#x2F; (The Decentralized Identity and Credential&#x2F;Authentic Data Issuing system) both launched and in MVP. Our demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=i-cRg_FuMVc the intro is relevant and important but the actual demo starts at ~14 min in: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;i-cRg_FuMVc?t=838  My Linkedin → https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;leahhoustonmd&#x2F; If this project interests you let’s connect.",
