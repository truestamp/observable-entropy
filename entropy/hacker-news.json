They have this new app, ArriveCan, that they require you to fill out some basic information that probably would be fine to fill out with paper or something else. But that option simply does not exist.<p>For most of our crowd, this is not an issue. But imagine those that are older. Those that don’t want to use android or iOS. Or in the case of a friend, those who have low battery and basically no data.<p>I think it’s ridiculous.<p>(for the record: I am strongly pro-vaccine and pretty in favor of reasonable restrictions)",
