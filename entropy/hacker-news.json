      "text": "Formal modeling is a mathematical approach for designing and checking correctness of software systems. It focuses on standard software engineering and distributed systems problems of the sort programmers face every day. It takes a pragmatic engineering approach: each problem starts with UML diagrams, design decisions and sometimes even a requirements document. We work through how to get from a whiteboard design to an initial mathematical model. Then we refine it based on logical errors found by the model checker, which return with a level of detail unheard of in a standard debugger. Formal modeling is a skill every engineer should have in their toolbox.<p>All the examples are downloadable, and their is a quick setup section at the start. Additionally, there is an explorable model error debugger build right into the website.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elliotswart.github.io&#x2F;pragmaticformalmodeling&#x2F;",
