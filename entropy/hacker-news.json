But pressing this option in fact just opens a Google search for &quot;translate XXX&quot; where XXX is whatever text you selected. No translation widget appears on the search result page and I don&#x27;t actually get a translation unless I click one of the links (which look like spam in the language I&#x27;m translating).<p>Has it always been like this? Why doesn&#x27;t the translate button actually link to their translation service?",
