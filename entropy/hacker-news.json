      "text": "Hello everyone,<p>I have put a lot of effort into building a WooCommerce plugin that sends messages through WhatsApp for various use-cases such as:<p>1: When an order is successfully placed\n2: When the user abandons the cart\n3: When someone submits a contact form\n4: WhatsApp Click to chat.<p>I heavily invested in SEO by creating a wonderful landing page https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whatso.net&#x2F;woocommerce-abandoned-cart.<p>I uploaded the plugin on AppSumo as well. I tried uploading it on CodeCanyon but somehow they didn&#x27;t select it and also didn&#x27;t give me a reason.<p>I am going to start Google Ads soon with even more focus on SEO.<p>I got a few customers and improved the product as well from their feedback but the kind of traction I was looking for, I am yet to get it.<p>I want to take the opinion of experts here on what else I can do to speed up the sales.",
