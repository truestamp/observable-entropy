      "text": "Hi HN, this is Ved -- the creator of Chimu.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chimu.sh<p>Chimu is a collaborative learning platform. It combines an e-reader with a Stack Overflow-like Q&amp;A forum. As people read books or papers, they can view others&#x27; questions and ask their own.<p>Take a look at a copy of Michael Nielsen&#x27;s Neural Networks and Deep Learning with a sample annotation here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chimu.sh&#x2F;d&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;wWELr-jIorg4Tz6WZk_vX<p>(works best on desktop)<p>Chimu helps the 1001th reader of a book or paper leverage the knowledge of everyone who came before them.<p>My plan with Chimu is to create world-class educational resources. If ten thousand people read a textbook and only 1% of those ten thousand ask a question on Chimu, that&#x27;s still 100 questions that a new learner no longer has to Google for when reading the textbook.<p>Chimu takes the friction out of learning.<p>The product is still in an early stage, but I&#x27;m excited to receive feedback from the HN crowd!",
