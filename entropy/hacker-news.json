      "text": "I recently just failed a technical task, it&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve failed in the last month. First one took me 4 hours and got rejected due to not being production ready.<p>Usually I get failed for the following reasons<p>* Didn&#x27;t split code into separate files (helper functions, single use components etc)<p>* Expected more tests (1 hour extra)<p>* Not doing the stretch goals<p>* Rudimentary XXX<p>* Would have liked to seen use of XXX (technology not \nincluded in the starting template)<p>* Didn&#x27;t use GitHub (publicly broadcasting my job search)<p>* Didn&#x27;t &lt;insert personal preference here&gt;<p>* Didn&#x27;t use a linter (5-30 minutes depending on codebase to set up)<p>I&#x27;m just wondering how common practice it is to lie about how long these tasks take?<p>In my most recent test, I included a time breakdown of how long various parts of the task took me, and still got rejected based on a &#x27;rudimentary&#x27; submission. There was literally no more time left to implement the feedback. I left the computer once to go to the toilet, and I took a minute to plug in my monitor, and other than that, flat out coding.<p>I see &#x27;should take no more than 2 hours&#x27;, on web-apps that include multiple components, responsive design, asynchronous state management and reading&#x2F;understanding the brief.<p>It&#x27;s at the stage I would prefer hacker rank tests now, as there is at least transparency and honesty about how long things should take and do take.<p>This feels a bit ranty, but I&#x27;ve been trying to find out if this is the norm, or the exception. UK based Front-End Dev. Do I need to start lying, or just accept that I&#x27;m going to have to spend 40 hours doing the same basic task over and over until I get the next job?",
