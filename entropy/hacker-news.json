      "text": "We had some free time during the Chinese New Year vacation (we live in Taiwan). So I thought it would be fun to work with my daughter on a little web project.<p>She did all the drawings. I digitized them and added them to the page as inline SVGs. Then I wrote the code. Nothing fancy — it&#x27;s just one HTML page with a few links. But I like the end result (yes, I&#x27;m 100% biased): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevin.tw<p>Fun technical facts: the page is entirely self-contained (except the favicon). It doesn&#x27;t have any JavaScript at all. And it weighs 35Kb total (52Kb if you include the favicon).",
