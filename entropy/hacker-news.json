Or, put another, are there particular subjects or genres that appeal to you?<p>All the following genres would appeal to me if I was writing a novel:<p>- Sci-fi set in a future earth (Yes, I know, the sci-fi genre is such a clichéd stereotype about the type of fiction that developers read! )<p>- Horror<p>- Some aspect of technology e.g. a dsytopian future involving A.I.<p>There are types of fiction I enjoy reading but wouldn&#x27;t attempt to write: thrillers, historical novels, fantasy.<p>If you were to write a novel, what subject would you pick? And for anyone who has written a novel (or is writing one currently) tell us about what you chose to write about.",
