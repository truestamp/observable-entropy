      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using SDS a lot and really like the library. However it sometimes feels like overkill because when I&#x27;m building strings I frequently know that it will be within some bound of length. The full dynamic length capabilities aren&#x27;t necessary and can become a pain-point when doing error handling. But on the otherhand the &lt;string.h&gt; functions always feel very verbose to maintain.<p>As such to scratch my own itch this weekend, I&#x27;ve developed SBS. SBS reformulates SDS around providing pre-defined buffers to perform the operation on. This means no resource management and the opportunity to use it in embedded environments that do not have heap allocation.<p>It is still very early on (no tags yet) but I want to see if there exists other libraries in this area? All I can dig up online are built around dynamic heap allocation.",
