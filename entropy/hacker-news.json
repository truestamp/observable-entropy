      "text": "I recently shut my small travel business and lost all I had worked for over the last few years. After incurring massive debt and struggling for a few months I have decided to start looking for a job. However, the burden while looking for a job has been so hard on me to an extent that living sometimes becomes meaningless. I have tried freelancing opportunities in my Marketing field but very little has come my way. I am posting this because I feel am not the first one to go through this startup failure&#x2F;debt thing and I believe someone&#x27;s experience on how they overcame might just help me pull through. Thank you in advance.",
