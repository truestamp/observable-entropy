In fact, leading with how much money you&#x27;ve raised makes me doubt that you have your priorities straight.<p>How about &quot;Hi, we&#x27;re X. We&#x27;re solving problem Y by doing Z&quot;.<p>Or, even better:<p>&quot;Hi, we&#x27;re X. We solved problem Y by doing Z, and are now seeking to monetize.&quot;<p>Money is certainly important, but raising funding shouldn&#x27;t be the point of your startup. Doing interesting stuff is more important than funding.",
