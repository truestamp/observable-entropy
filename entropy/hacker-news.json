So you&#x27;ve got the majority of the best intellectual capital in the world solving poor outcomes on the chain — why wouldn&#x27;t you expect that to work?&quot;<p>Is his heuristic good? Are there examples of many highly intelligent people being drawn to work on technologies or ideas that ultimately prove useless?",

      "text": "A recent post (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31750981) shows an implementation of 2-Dimensional Voronoi diagrams, by rendering a number of cones, collapsing along the z-axis, and using the GPU&#x27;s z-culling as a de facto optimiser (it even bakes in free inter-cell anti-aliasing).<p>(This also allows weighted voronoi to be implemented simply by changing the gradient of the cones.)<p>I&#x27;m treating this as an analogue to 2-dimensional light-cones with a depth axis treated as the dimension of time. The z-axis collapse leaves everything within the domain of the first cone to intersect any given [x, y] 2-Dimensional location.<p>If we get depth culling in 4-dimensions, we can take a space [x, y, z, Ω] and treat our Ω dimension as the dimension of time (as we did for z in 2-dimensions).<p>And that would give us 3D voronois (with a lot of skipped stuff about volumetric rendering).<p>We can alter the gradients of the 4D cones, then we have weighted 3D voronois.<p>I think that this could be used for an interesting voxel experiment.",

      "text": "I have a main router and since my back patio and garage don&#x27;t get the WiFi coverage, I have installed a range extender. Whenever I visit the garage my iPhone 12 Pro Max doesn&#x27;t seem to switch to the range extender, I have to manually open WiFi settings and click on it for it to connect. Now I go back to my living room and sit right next to my main router, my phone is still talking to the range extender even throws poor connection&#x2F;no internet (!) and I have to walk again through the settings and select my main router. Is it that hard to automatically switch between saved Access Points based on relative signal strengths?",
