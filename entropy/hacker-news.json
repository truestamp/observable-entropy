      "text": "Throwaway for anonymity.<p>In a recent thread, it was discussed sending bitcoin donations to Alexandra Elbakyan (the founder of Sci Hub). This made me curious around the legality of donating to them as well as prominent figures such as Edward Snowden. I reached out to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (who I thought would be at the intersection of freedom of speech and technology) inquiring if they&#x27;d provide a public opinion on donating to Snowden specifically, and I was told this would not be a matter they would be interested in providing representation on (I did offer to pay for the services, if that matters). They did offer to refer my request to their Cooperating Attorneys mailing list, which I appreciated, but felt it doesn&#x27;t carry the same weight as the EFF taking a public position on the matter.<p>In short, where would one seek out an attorney for such an endeavor (case law research and public attestation to the legality of donating to the individuals mentioned above)?<p>Thanks as always HN.",
