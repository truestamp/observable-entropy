This interview style requires that interviewers have broader knowledge, are able to listen, and think on their feet.<p>However, the trial period requires the employee to accept a significantly higher chance of getting let go in the first 3 months of the job in the case of a false positive or bad fit. I&#x27;d be willing to incur the cost of onboarding someone that might leave in return for the much better signal it provides over whiteboard coding. But getting fired or asked to resign is a big emotional blow for many people, and I&#x27;m not sure if they would rather face that than the Leetcode grind. Would you?<p>Also, it could be worse for culture if a higher % of new employees were fired under this model--existing employees don&#x27;t know if the new person is going to stay, and new employees feel like they&#x27;re under the gun. Any thoughts there?",
