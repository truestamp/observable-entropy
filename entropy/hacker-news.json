If watched carefully, he gives the impression that his mental health is not stable and he might be having trouble with his delusions. On his good days, he finds the power to actually say he got hospitalized multiple times.<p>Recently, a Turkish Youtuber discovered this channel and told his audience to be kind and caring to him but obviously it backfired. Many people now go there and make fun of the man. I&#x27;m worried it will lead him to a dangerous place if this continues.<p>I tried my best to report as many harassment comments as possible but none of the comments has gone away yet.<p>What is the proper way of taking action in these kind of circumstances?",
