      "text": "I used to &quot;trust&quot; Google News to give me a reasonable picture of the state of the world, perhaps even with some bias towards things I&#x27;m interested in, but now I find it very difficult to navigate. Choosing a region biases the news loads, and I can&#x27;t choose Europe as a region. I would like something which is as broad as possible, and reports on the important stuff. Nowadays I tend to use the Guardian because I&#x27;m fairly progressive-leaning and it seems good enough in terms of quality, and it&#x27;s also free (I really don&#x27;t want to have to pay for another subscription, but I understand that beggars can&#x27;t be choosers). Is there anything else I should check out? With the recent invasion of Ukraine, I have relied more and more on Twitter, but I really struggle to get the signal out of the noise, it&#x27;s just not proper journalism. What I noticed, however, is that major news outlets tend to just rebroadcast whatever is on Twitter, just with many hours of delay and (hopefully, but not always, given the fast-paced rate at which new stuff happens) with some fact-checking. I am really looking for advice.",
