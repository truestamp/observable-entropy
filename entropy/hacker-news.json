      "text": "I might be looking for something that already exists, but it does not seem to be the case.<p>Numerous launcher applications are available on F-droid, including text&#x2F;search-based ones, Pixel clones, and so on. However, all classic-style Android launchers show applications in multiple copies: if you put one on the homescreen, it is still shown in the app drawer. This creates needless redundancy, because the app drawer is cluttered with applications that are easily reachable from the home screen anyway.<p>On the other hand, iOS-style launchers force every icon, a single one for each app, on the home screen(s), but offer no app drawer.<p>Therefore, I&#x27;m here to ask if there is any launcher that has an app drawer, but hides the icons there, if they are placed on the home screen?<p>This approach would produce a home screen with frequently used apps, and a more usable app drawer that only contains applications that are not visible elsewhere, thus improving the user&#x27;s chances of findig them.<p>Thanks for the insight in advance!<p>Edit: formed proper paragraphs",
