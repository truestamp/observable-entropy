It’s different names, sometimes the same content and layout, sometimes unique. I find this quite bizarre, and I imagine it’s some kind of “ask everyone on LinkedIn with software engineer in their title to apply” strategy. Does anyone else experience this? Do you know if these are just bots? I’d love to turn it off too as I have no interest in working there but yeah just curious if others experience this weirdness.",
