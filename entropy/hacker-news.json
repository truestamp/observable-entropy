      "text": "Is there anything that can point at the speed of cognition of reading discernment&#x2F;interpretation of subtitles of movies&#x2F;shows?<p>Basically, the interest is in the ability to read a sentence vs hear it spoken bewilders me:<p>If I watch a movie spoken in korean, I obviously need to have subtitle as I cannot speak&#x2F;understand korean. So I read the subtitles.<p>Yet I prefer to watch all english shows with subtitles because I can read faster than the speaker may speak, and also I like to increase the speed of any video to 1.25 or 1.5X speed to hurry up the message.<p>Do other, non-english-native speakers do the same?<p>Is it the same for Chinese, Swedish, French, whatever native-speakers to do this?<p>Language at its base is a symbolic representation of ideas and thought, and its easier to absorb information in symbols and such as it is. This is where the idea of imbuing information (emotions) into logos come from...<p>It is where writing comes from.<p>Are some languages easier&#x2F;faster to understand via their writing vs their spoken word?",
