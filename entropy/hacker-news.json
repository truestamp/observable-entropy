      "text": "I&#x27;ve gotten myself a Supernote A5X (awesome device btw) and since it doesn&#x27;t have a web browser or anything I&#x27;ve wanted to have a way to read news on it. I&#x27;ve hacked together this utility in a couple of days and it works wonders for me personally so I thought it might be interesting to others. It can also be used as a noise free newspaper generator as it removes images&#x2F;ads&#x2F;links and other noisy stuff.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lnenad&#x2F;newser<p>(there is a screenshot of the first page of the generated pdf)<p>It scrapes (news) websites for content and puts it into a pdf. For me the pdf location is my dropbox supernote directory so my setup is to run this thing daily and have a fresh pdf with news whenever I want it.<p>It&#x27;s rough around the edges probably (currently added crawl support for verge, ars, engadget) but I think it&#x27;s a good base so if anyone wants to contribute feel free. Some of the stuff I want to add is pictures (maybe), maybe parse the text html to include font styling and other stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to generalize it as much as possible so the crawling is pretty much automatic and is controlled by a config file where you define &quot;rules&quot; on how to parse the website.",
