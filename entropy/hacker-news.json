First time, IT guy said ok &quot;answer these three personal security questions you set and I&#x27;ll unlock your account&quot;. I answered them, account unlocked, good to go.<p>The second time I called, the same guy answered and said &quot;oh... I think I remember you from a few hours ago. No need to answer any of your security questions, I think I remember them.&quot; AND THEN HE SAID THE ANSWERS BACK TO ME OVER THE PHONE. I was dumbfounded. Had to come here to get reactions.",
