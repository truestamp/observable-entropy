      "text": "The basic principle of agile development is to bring features early and often. Agile promotes iterative work where the iteration lasts in weeks rather than months. It functions like a charm when we mostly know the path that leads to the solution.<p>But, I believe there is a drawback to that idea. Under time pressure, it is only human to play safely, do whatever is the most obvious, discard the up-front thinking, and apply the most familiar solution for the problem. Consequently, the result will be something already tried out, something seen and already known.<p>So, under pressure to act early and often, we miss the opportunity to think thoroughly, contemplate, and imagine a novel solution to the problem. We miss the chance to realize our best ideas.<p>What do you think?",
