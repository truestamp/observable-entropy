      "text": "I am a software developer just like many users of wonderful community of HN and an ardent HN user myself for around 7 years . It has inspired me to pursue software dev as a career as well as a passion beyond the office. However , today I come to HN to seek your thoughts on a non-tech related topic. My mother was diagnosed with cancer a month and half back and after two surgeries has started with the first round of chemotherapy. It has been quite a tough last few days ever since the chemo started with the common side effects of the treatment as is known. It has been really challenging through the daily tasks at work, and an honestly finding it quite difficult to cope, seeing my mother go through this. If anyone here has ever or is going through a similar situation , I am looking to seek some answers,  on how you cope&#x2F;coped and managed your work and day to day schedule , and how &#x2F; what you did to care for your parents. I really wish no family would&#x27;ve to ever go through this. But its life I suppose and we have to accept it and learn to deal with it. I am just learning to , and am looking for some direction here, so I can do my best to balance a job and take care of my family through this time.",
