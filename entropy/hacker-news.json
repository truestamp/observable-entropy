      "text": "Why API security is a typical issue. Most web and versatile applications are security tried sooner or later yet APIs barely stand out. This implies you might have weaknesses in your creation APIs.<p>For instance, suppose you have a fintech application. It does things like records, moves, and so forth. It has portable&#x2F;web UIs for playing out these tasks. You could have tried all the UI ways are simply open to a validated client. Some of the time API endpoint like the one beneath is left unstable on the grounds that without acknowledgment and any programmer&#x2F;bot can get it and consistently make a point to focus on a feed of late exchanges. The best way to fix these sorts of imperfections is to recognize them before they&#x27;re taken advantage of.<p>Example endpoint with the flaw: GET: &#x2F;transactions - Any bot can access it without authentication because it has a broken authentication flaw.<p>One easy way to detect an OWASP API2 vulnerability or security flaw in your APIs is to use open-source tools like Burp and EthicalCheck. Using these tools is very simple. All you need is your OpenAPI Specification&#x2F;Swagger URL and get an instant report.",
