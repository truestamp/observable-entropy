Maybe 30 minutes later the wifi in the entire shop shut down. I can tell it wasn’t just me cause I looked over and the people at a table next to me had no internet connection either. Did the store’s IT realize someone was using a Monero miner and shut down the entire shop wifi or was this just a coincidence. I’m not saying I’m going to do this again, but would using a VPN prevent this?",
