      "text": "I came across a meme which made reference to a longitude and latitude. Being curious, I entered it on Google Maps and it took me to a building in the Czech Republic. Nothing was immediately apparent so I switched to the satellite view. My juvenile sense of humour was satiated and I immediately decided to forward the coordinates to a couple of friends with equally juvenile taste.<p>I got one reply back asking me what the significance of a blank building was? First I thought they had totally missed the joke but it occurred to me that this image was rather hard to miss.<p>I fiddled around for a bit and tried on my different Gmail accounts and I was able to replicate different satellite images being displayed. One set of images clearly new and crisp, whilst the other rather blurred and dark.<p>Now I warn you, this a bit NSFW but the comparison is below.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;v9yLpZb<p>So my question is: does anyone know what factors go into displaying different results to different accounts?<p>My first thought would be some form of timed rollout of new imagery to prevent any glitches and naughties reaching the masses. But that clearly slipped through the cracks.",
