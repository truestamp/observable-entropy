      "text": "I was introduced to Aristotle&#x27;s &#x27;Poetics&#x27; in college and it transformed the trajectory of my life. The Poetics, as you may or may not know, is the foundation for nearly every western-oriented tragedy: novels, plays, films, etc. dating back centuries. It&#x27;s THE text upon which western drama is founded in so many respects (though not all).<p>However, I was also told Aristotle also wrote&#x2F;dictated a (now lost to us) rendition of &quot;Comedy.&quot; And for the better part of a decade I&#x27;ve been trying to do two things:\n- Take modern comedy and dilute it toward logical precepts which could be echoed&#x2F;reverse engineered to represent what Aristotle may have conceived for that lost treatise\n- Find some sliver of Aristotle&#x27;s lost &quot;Comedy&quot;<p>I realize this isn&#x27;t the typical fair for YC, but I&#x27;ve asked this question over the years to so many people, across multiple forums, and in person or emails to professors of Greek lit, and I&#x27;m as lost as I was when I first learned the &quot;Comedy&quot; was lost...<p>If you have any books you can recommend, people to contact&#x2F;interview, or just general context on this issue I&#x27;d be grateful to hear them.<p>Thank you",
