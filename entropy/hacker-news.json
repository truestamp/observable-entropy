      "text": "So we decided to test the demand for a service that would help small brands land influencers that are knocking on their DMs.<p>Usually it takes a lot of waiting and communicating on both parts if conducted on Instagram.<p>Instead a brand could have a landing page with the offer and terms of partnerships they usually offer to influencers and just send this link to an influencer.<p>Influencer then could read it and apply by connecting their IG handle.<p>Brand would receive all the information about all applicants in one beautifully organized dashboard with the ability to:<p>1. Analyze the insights\n2. Approve&#x2F;Reject influencer\n3. Get contact info and then negotiate the details off the platform.<p>Additionally, we would add the campaign performance &amp; reporting in the near future.<p>Let me know if you know any e-commerce owners who would love to give our product a test and provide a feedback:)",
