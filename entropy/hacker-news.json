All I is know enough subject matters to make things work. Is there something fundamental that I am missing?<p>I enjoy life in the most boring way. Just doing enough to pass a day. I strive for being good, but my good is just average. Is it necessary to be competitive to have a successful career in tech?<p>How far can a boring person with diversified interest go?<p>If one doesn&#x27;t aim for excellence, is it a bad thing?<p>I am really early in my career and sometimes I get cold feet when I see how incredible other people are.<p>What does it take to uplift myself and my own levels?<p>I have come to realize that just to make a small dent (as in new contribution beyond being a boring copy-cat), I would require tremendous amount of years of consistent effort.<p>Thank you for suggestions!",
