We have around 30 books just on Python alone, not counting any that are about using Python for things like machine learning or data science.<p>Other than clear version changes (like Python 2 to Python 3), are older programming books still useful? The majority of the books span from around 2014 to the present, and they&#x27;re all still circulating.<p>Thanks!  (And thank you for the book recommendations posted here as well, I have definitely purchased some of them for our collection.)",

What gets developers to sign up and try your dev-oriented product in an authentic way?\n- Are there specific platforms or communities where developers are more receptive to these requests?\n- Maybe a specific type of pitch that is more effective?\n- Perhaps a specific medium that most developers prefer?<p>I&#x27;m very interested to hear what&#x27;s worked well for you.<p>Thank you!",
