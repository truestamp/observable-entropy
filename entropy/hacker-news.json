      "text": "Constitutional questions of Apple&#x27;s move aside... I don&#x27;t know whether we&#x27;re going to see Swatting-like attacks using this mechanism, nor an activist&#x2F;troll mass attack with it, and I don&#x27;t want to find out firsthand.<p>Looking into US privacy-respecting alternatives to iPhone this weekend, both T-Mobile and Apple are imminently forcing VoLTE.  I&#x27;ve not yet found reputable Android AOSP-derived ROMs or other open source firmware supporting that.  (Also, carriers reportedly will allow&#x2F;deny devices by IMEI model.)  Looks like regulatory authorities are OK with all this.<p>Stock Android installs on devices carriers will permit are more respectful than iPhone in some regards, but are still very heavy on commercial privacy invasion and security vulnerabilities.  They&#x27;ll also probably get abandoned for security updates, etc., and alternative ROMs no longer mitigating that.<p>Librem 5 looks good in principle, but the only Librem 5 on eBay just now was a preproduction one for $700+, and dunno how long Purism will be wrangling carriers.<p>The few featurephones seem to be crap and&#x2F;or include integrations with the most infamous social media services, which is a really bad sign.<p>None of the various Linux phone efforts seem ready even today, and carriers are a moving target.<p>I just spent the weekend trying to move from my iPhone.  (And, when I tried a SIM in a stock Android phone, the carrier suspended my service, taking many hours of misery to get it restored in the iPhone it had been in.)<p><i>How do we keep even a minimal phone number (voice &amp; SMS), without all these privacy&amp;security regressions?</i>  (Practically, and solid, and through at least the 2021-2022 VoLTE switchover, and hopefully years after.  A phone number is still required by some gov&#x27;t and critical services.  Wireless data would be nice, but we currently could survive with WiFi, etc.)",

Specifically, I&#x27;d like to do my part in taking active steps to help fight climate change.<p>I do stuff outside of programming for the environment (not as much as I&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s a bit of a separate issue), but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has thoughts on ways I can use my skills to contribute a cause that is matters a bit more.<p>I&#x27;ve considered contributing to OS projects - but I have no idea what might be impactful and useful to the world generally. Anyone have thoughts on projects &#x2F; specific ways I can put my free time to use programming in this direction?<p>Thanks for any thoughts :)",
