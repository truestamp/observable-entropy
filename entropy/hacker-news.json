      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed that in the market we are in there is still no clear winner and that competitors, even the big ones, are very easy to steal customers to. Also it&#x27;s clear to me that most of the big players in the market are running just by VC&#x27;s money trying to blitzscale or simply bruteforce product market fit, by hiring a huge sales team and spend money in a clear unsustainable growth. Is this a sign that there is still a big space for innovation I&#x27;m the market or that the problem with the current available production costs is not worth solving? Hopefully I&#x27;ve explained clearly the dilemma I have in my head, pls give feedback.<p>Adding some context: we&#x27;ve built a gym management system app. We have few clients and a modest MRR which is growing (slowly) overtime.",
