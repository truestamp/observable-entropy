      "text": "Hello,<p>I have had some ideas I wanted to transform into reality. It&#x27;s a website for a company that I work for.<p>The idea is simple because we don&#x27;t need to &quot;explain ourselves&quot;. I&#x27;d just like a simple single-page web containing one animated logo and maybe 1-2 links.<p>How should I approach building the web? I have zero-to-none knowledge of web building. I&#x27;ve previously created web pages with wordpress but it&#x27;s too complicated for my current needs.\nIs it possible to create some responsive web in, for example, HTML5 (bear in mind I&#x27;m not familiar with the possibilities of each programming language offered for web).<p>I&#x27;d also like to not use all the junk-filled prepaid websites with other limitations that offer solution for my problem since I have access to webhosting a webserver so only thing I need is &quot;the website&quot;. Pardon my language I&#x27;m not a native english speaker.<p>Thanks for any advice.",
