      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I spend last weekend improving the copy of my landing page. In that process, I came across a bunch of articles prescribing which words to use and which ones not to use.<p>I found it tedious to check for for the words manually so I created a tiny app to do it for me. Right now it checks for the use of hedge, weasel and filler words. I also went through a lot of marketing websites to check words they recommend and suggest not to use.<p>It&#x27;s very bare bone but I am curious to get some opinions about how to improve it.",
