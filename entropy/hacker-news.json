      "text": "I&#x27;m an amateur blogger and programmer, running a custom-made static site on a Linode VM with Caddy [1]. I don&#x27;t use containers or CDNs or anything fancy; my site generator just spits HTML into a folder and I rsync it to the server.<p>Do I need anything more than this? Is there some modern technology that is demonstrably better than my workflow? I worry I&#x27;ve been left behind, but I also find containers and other modern obsessions to be overkill for my needs.<p>Thanks for any and all advice.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caddyserver.com&#x2F;",
