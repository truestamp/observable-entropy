Yet now it&#x27;s common knowledge. Is it possible that decentralized apps and blockchain technology is going follow a similar course? And when &quot;classical&quot; web development becomes saturated, these will continue being the highly valued specialist markets?<p>I guess what I&#x27;m asking is, do you feel it is wise and valuable in the long term to begin pivoting one&#x27;s career to blockchain now rather than staying as a typical web dev?",
