      "text": "Hey HN,\nI recently completed my internship at a 1000+ employee public tech company. I did great work, had stellar performance reviews (my manager and teammates liked me and had no constructive criticism), and I have years of other internship experience. I know for a fact other interns that did far less work (read: slacked off) got the same new grad offer as me. It’s a very generous offer, but out of principal I feel like I should be entitled to a better one if I can &#x2F; did provide more value to the company. I tried negotiating and will hear back soon, but I was ultimately told they give new grads the same package as they know we talk offers and they wanted to remain fair. They say that my performance reviews once I’ve joined will determine my raises&#x2F;promotions, but I’d rather start with a higher base than expect on a potential promotion. Some people have mentioned pay equity to me (I’m an upper class white cis male), and while I understand my privilege got me to where I am, I still worked hard to get here. Am I wrong to expect more?",
