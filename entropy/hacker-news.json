You have a solid MVP, you have customers lining up at the door to use it, and you don&#x27;t have a huge amount of expenses to keep it running, yet.<p>Your plan is to raise a seed round and go full time.<p>Do you go full time first, then start to raise?<p>Or do you try to raise with the expectation that you&#x27;ll go full time once funding comes through? Free from the distraction of &quot;how will I pay my mortgage?&quot;, with a straightforward transition from a full time job to a full time startup role.<p>Do VCs tend to prefer the former, or is it ever typical for founders to raise and then go full time?",
