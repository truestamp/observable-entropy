      "text": "Hello.<p>I was looking through my rebel domains because i wanted a .sucks domain to tell technation.io that they really sucked (because they engage in outright left-wing extremist attacks on candidates and terrorise young vulnerable people who have no means of defending themselves, by providing absolutely blatant lies because they know that they&#x27;re cameron&#x27;s cronies and won&#x27;t be touched by law and they will be proven wrong you just wait and see a little, very little i promise you) for 30 bucks but the offer is a-djourned. and realised I worked on a website called https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsdoc.dev in 2021 but never really published it in the end therefore i thought i should do that before the new years even though i didn&#x27;t finish it so it&#x27;s kind of like a first chapter of a book as per hackernews rules for the show category or something. The website is<p>please be advised (warning, warning - Kevin Malone) that this is supposed to be a landing page for a product however there&#x27;s no info yet or an option to buy the software or even its description i just mean that what you find there isn&#x27;t the full thing as the paper have not been properly structured and concluded. despite that when i read it now i thought it&#x27;s actually very useful and you won&#x27;t find me trying to sell you anything you could just comment on the design and what you think ) i even used custom-shape masking for yall you know please say something nice although i didn&#x27;t install the polyfill for ie11 i think yet it&#x27;s possible.<p>please don&#x27;t judge strictly i hope the website about JSDoc 2.0 here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsdoc.dev&#x2F; with its tutorial be useful to some also i coin jsdoc 2.0 term coz now it includes module support. There&#x27;s somebody using a similar technique for import you can find online yet mine is more full as there&#x27;s an important bit that you shouldn&#x27;t miss because even if you love typescript you won&#x27;t deny the fact that it is deficient in a manner that I outline in the article and provide a solution in its pure form ie in JS.",
