      "text": "Inspired by yesterday&#x27;s thread about WGU[0], a prominent online university for non-traditional and professional students, I decided to check out the school and started filling out an application.<p>After I filled out contact details, and without even submitting the form, I immediately got a phone call from one of their admission counselors, eager to answer any questions. I politely thanked them for their time, and they called me back again today, still eager to answer any questions I have about admissions. I expect them to be in regular contact with me until I finally enroll in their program.<p>I think this is the kind of &quot;going above and beyond&quot; that distinguishes modern, relevant institutions from the dinosaur colleges that don&#x27;t care about their students at all and only exist to employ hordes of overpaid administrators and professors.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31180816",
