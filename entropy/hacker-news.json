      "text": "I&#x27;m not sure if this is a cause of more people moving to remote-first and difficulty showing emotions over slack&#x2F;messaging as the main communication, or just people stressed out over covid in general.  Since we went remote-first company-wide, emotions spike way more easily on the negative when something goes wrong.<p>I haven&#x27;t experienced this myself since I&#x27;ve been at the company fairly long and had been remote for about three years prior to Covid hitting.  I&#x27;m not sure if I just learned how to conduct myself in a virtual setting or if this is the norm.   But I&#x27;ve seen coworkers lash out on others over what could be an easy fix or mundane item fairly often.<p>Just wondering if others are dealing with similar issues and how you handle a confrontation over video where one is talking over the other, or over Slack, where neither reads the other&#x27;s responses and continue to cherry-pick pieces of a response escalating an argument.",
