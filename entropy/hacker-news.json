      "text": "I have $25k remaining credit from Google Cloud Platforms, which expires in about a month. I got the credit over 2 years ago and had hundreds of severs for various websites, database storage, elasticsearch instances, dedicated servers for random cron tasks, etc. But I still haven&#x27;t been able to exhaust the credit. I even used it to train several models using multiple Tesla GPUs. But beyond a point I felt like I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing with the models and stopped wasting GPU cycles on them.<p>I feel like if I don&#x27;t use it for something useful it&#x27;ll be wasted. Any ideas?",
