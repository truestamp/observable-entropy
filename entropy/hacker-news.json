I am not interested in finding a full-time job anywhere but I still want to have up-to-date credentials for business meetings.<p>Is CISSP worth it? It costs $750 to take the test and in case of fail there is no discount. Also after passing there is $150 yearly membership fee. Study materials seem very long (500+ page books). If not CISSP, for security or advanced IT would you recommend anything else excluding AWS ones?<p>Thanks!",
