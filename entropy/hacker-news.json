      "text": "Hi HN,<p>a while ago I discovered a problem with problem with personal productivity tools: Every time you find a tool that works well in one regard (say, habit tracking), you neglect your previously working systems (say, your to do list system).<p>So I set about to build a system which unifies all the different aspects of personal productivity. Everything is represented in cards (like flash cards) which are defined in Markdown. The following types of cards exist:<p>* <i>Learning</i>: Classic front&#x2F;back prompts to memorize things. Think &quot;What is the capital of Argentina?&quot; on the front and &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; on the back. Works with a spaced repetition algorithm so time between prompts is optimized.<p>* <i>Habits</i>: Recurring actions you want to do - you can set the frequency individually. For example &quot;Stand up and walk around your room&quot; every two hours.<p>* <i>Checks</i>: Recurring prompts, similar to habits, but always questions referring to the past. For example a daily &quot;Did you drink enough today?&quot; prompt<p>* <i>To do</i>: One time actions that are deleted upon completion.<p>* <i>Reading List</i>: Used for books, articles, talks etc. There are always a limited number of reading list items active, which will prompt you to read a page a day until you are done with the given book.<p>* <i>Other</i>: Everything else - interesting websites, quotes, art or even memes that you will occasionally see.<p>The idea is that there is a single queue for all types of cards, only ever showing you one item that&#x27;s due next - whether habit, learning prompt or a random note. This prevents choice fatigue, the dread of lengthy to-do lists and the boredom of endless dry learning prompts.<p>I&#x27;ve been using the app successfully for myself for quite some time now but would love external feedback. You can check it out at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaado.io. It&#x27;s currently completely free (and in fairly early stage development). Simple email signup is needed but you won&#x27;t get any unprompted mails.<p>Apart from that I would love your takes and ideas regarding personal productivity and what works for you.",
