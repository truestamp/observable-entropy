      "text": "After having been a regular employee for years, I worked as a freelancer for a while. Going into my freelancing life I had no real mental model for how much of the money I earned was truly mine to spend, and how much of it I needed to set aside for taxes, vacations, retirement, and in case I got sick. I modelled this in Excel as best I could and was quite surprised both by how complicated it was to get right, and how much money I actually needed to set aside!<p>As my girlfriend also started freelancing last year, I decided to turn my Excel sheet into a little program she could use too, and in the spirit of sharing and helping others I would hereby like to make it available to you all too :)<p>My biggest take-away so far has been that most people dramatically underestimate how much they need to set aside, and forget to plan adequately for getting sick and for retirement.<p>You can find the tool here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;howmuch.probsteide.com&#x2F;<p>Comments, questions, and suggestions are more than welcome!<p>I wish you all a happy Easter Weekend!<p>In case you skipped to the bottom: you can find the tool at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;howmuch.probsteide.com&#x2F;",
