      "text": "Ok so I just got to the magical level of 500 karma points on HN, unlocking the legendary downvote button.<p>But I do not like it, and I will in fact boycott it, vowing to never use it. Why you ask?<p>UX wise, it&#x27;s too blunt and its purpose too vaguely defined. It resembles a &quot;dislike&quot; button.<p>Algorithm wise, it is too powerful, and seems like -4 points gives you a throttle (which actually means strangle) for a few hours.<p>Happened to me when I posted a smug (or?) remark on an OCaml post. Not gonna lie - going slightly out of line resulting in a hour-long &quot;shut up&quot; period felt very humiliating.<p>Everyone knows that a downvote is very powerful. Yet it&#x27;s obvious that people use it against dissenting opinion. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re getting downvoted&quot;.<p>In a sense it becomes a kind of elitist power tool, earned by conforming to that silent but crushing pool of downvoters.<p>Speaking candidly, it therefor almost becomes like a social credit system, and deplatforms dissenting voices.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I can word it any better than this.<p>This is the problem. What is the solution?",
