      "text": "Hi there!\nImagine that you are an investor. You invest in startups at pre-seed and seed stages.\nCompanies at these stages have no strong results because there are no sales.\nWe all know that the valuation of such startups is the founders&#x27; valuation.\nAnd there are risks of disharmony between founders and investors.\nAnd perhaps the most critical question is: will this particular team be able to create a future unicorn?<p>Usually, the decision is made after an interview (or several interviews).\nI think that there is an element of subjectivity and bias here.<p>What would you say, as an investor, if there were such a service that gives an assessment of founders and teams about the risks of investing?\nThis assessment is based on the coincidence of the values of founders and key employees.\nThis assessment is done using validated techniques and tests and helps the investor make a more objective decision.\nDo you think such a product would be helpful for founders and investors?",
