      "text": "Specifically one dealing with acquiring other companies in fintech?<p>I&#x27;m thinking about switching to that sort of role. I like learning new things and applying those concepts. Seems like I could at least study other people solving interesting problems. Better than the mostly configuration and infrastructure work I do now. Not sure what will be involved in the role (reached out to the manager for info). Seems like most of the team members have prestigious degrees (Wharton MBA, etc) with a heavy finance background.",
