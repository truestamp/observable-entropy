      "text": "I&#x27;ve created programming language based on Ruby that simplifies creating Terminal text-based games and applications in the browser. I&#x27;ve released first 1.0 beta version, but I&#x27;m still adding features and fixing bugs. I yet need to add more documentation and improve Gaiman playground.<p>The repo for the language can be found on GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcubic&#x2F;gaiman the only documentation so far is the Wiki with Reference manual https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcubic&#x2F;gaiman&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reference-Manual\nand examples directory: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcubic&#x2F;gaiman&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples<p>And playground can be found at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gaiman.js.org&#x2F; There is proper tutorial on my TODO list. I&#x27;ve created a game for it (guess the number) that is only 31 lines of code, I&#x27;ve added it to git:\n https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jcubic&#x2F;gaiman&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;guess_the_number.gs<p>You can copy paste the code into playground and play with it.<p>On my road map there is also node.js version, so you will be able to run your apps in the terminal.",
