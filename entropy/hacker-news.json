Yes, there were conveniences around having an individual place, etc, but I recall most AirBnBs being priced well below hotels of roughly equal quality.<p>When I look now, it is often cheaper to stay in a hotel than an AirBnB of roughly equal quality, sometimes significantly so. This pattern has held in at least 10 major&#x2F;minor US cities I’ve used over at least the past year.<p>What economic forces are at work to cause this?",
