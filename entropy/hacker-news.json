      "text": "After reading the recent HN article about why buying the dip may not work [0], I started reviewing my personal retirement strategy and began wondering how other HN readers approach the subject.  As for me, I plan on using a modified bucket strategy [1] using 2 buckets instead of three (since the savings rates are too low).  My plan is to keep 2-3 years of living expenses in a high-interest savings account with the the second bucket in various S&amp;P500 index funds (VOO, VOOG, etc).  Every few years, I plan on pulling out some cash to refill the bucket (assuming market conditions are positive).  Even with the recent market dip, I am confident this is still the best strategy for me.<p>Curious as to what other HN readers are using for their retirement strategy...<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31287464\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartasset.com&#x2F;retirement&#x2F;retirement-bucket-strategy#:~:text=The%20retirement%20bucket%20strategy%20is%20an%20investment%20approach%20that%20segregates,%2C%20intermediate%20and%20long-term.",
