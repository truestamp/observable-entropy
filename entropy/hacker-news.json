The response is always the same, the elevator company are not able to fix it yet, for &quot;reasons&quot; but it will be fixed as soon as they can. After a painful 15 minute wait to get to my floor, I finally called the elevator company and asked them why they&#x27;re unable to service the elevator in a brand new 46 floor building for over a month.<p>The answer, the computer manufacturer is unable to get chips, nor do they know when they will, so the computer unit is backordered, indefinitely.<p>Wondering if anyone else has daily life chip shortage anecdotes?",
