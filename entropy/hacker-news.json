      "text": "Back in the day I recall [PG posted][0] that having a .com that was the same as your company name was essential. These days I feel like almost every decent domain that is reasonably short and also naturally means something related to one&#x27;s product is taken. The options seem to be to create a new word, use a name unconnected to the product, or use a get&#x2F;try&#x2F;join prepend. Or spend quite a bit to get a premium domain.<p>In looking for a startup domain, about 70%+ of the domains I&#x27;ve explored are just parked with a domain seller.<p>In early startup stage it seems crazy to spend extra money on a domain, but then if you start brand-building, you might lose that work if you change the name later, especially in B2C.<p>There are a few examples of companies that don&#x27;t have .com but most who have an alternate domain end up spending $$ to buy the .com later. \nI&#x27;m curious from those who have either bought a premium domain, started with a different name, or chose a random word in order to avoid buying a premium domain, what was your experience?<p>[0]:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paulgraham.com&#x2F;name.html",
