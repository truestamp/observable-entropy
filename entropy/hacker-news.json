      "text": "Just watching Jeff Gerling&#x27;s video on home automation and it struck me:<p>If we want to simplify accessing things with IP addresses we use DNS. If we want encryption at transit we use TLS. Is it time for the tech community to make having a domain name for home networks with proper TLS on everything more trivial? I&#x27;ve achieved something like this with LetsEncrypt, DNS and NAT but that&#x27;s a little too involved for the average home. Is it time to &quot;Dropbox&quot; home DNS and TLS?",
