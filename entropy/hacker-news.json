      "text": "Fresh and (I think) clean implementations of Faster R-CNN in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2&#x2F;Keras.<p>I wanted to learn about object detectors and decided to understand and implement a foundational model in the field, Faster R-CNN (elements of which are still used in modern models to this day), using the paper alone. That proved to be more difficult than expected and I had to relent and take a peak at existing implementations to fill in some important gaps. I&#x27;ve documented my struggles and learnings in the README for others to benefit from.<p>I also wanted to solidify my understanding of TensorFlow&#x2F;Keras and learn PyTorch, so I made sure to implement the model in both. Faster R-CNN is fairly challenging in that it doesn&#x27;t quite map to Keras tutorial examples. For example, losses are not computed simply as a function of model output and input but rather, some of the training data is actually computed on-the-fly within the model during training and the losses have to explicitly be constructed as part of the graph.<p>Personally, I found the &quot;official&quot; TensorFlow reference implementation (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;models&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;research&#x2F;object_detection&#x2F;meta_architectures&#x2F;faster_rcnn_meta_arch.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;models&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;research&#x2F;ob...</a>) to be very difficult to follow and I hope this proves to be useful to learners like myself.",
