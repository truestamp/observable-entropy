      "text": "I&#x27;m 28 and have jumped over various fields in the past 7-8 years. I have a bachelor degree in mining engineering with a final project that used image processing. Later I have started learning html, css, and js to become a frontend developer. Later I have studied and worked in FOREX for almost a year and once again it bored me. So, I started a new job that eventually led to managing a development team, alongside I started learning about SEO to handle that part myself. After quitting that company, I have continued learning about data science, ML, and DL. It adored me and I have gained some experience in that field. However, after years of changing fields, I have decided to start frontend development once more. Am I crazy or what?",
