      "text": "I’m always scared to scan random QR codes, especially with a phone. You can see where you’re going with hyperlinks, but not with QR codes. If I’m paranoid I pass QR codes into a special program where I can inspect its contents (on a desktop PC), but using them with phones is a misfeature and phones need to show interstitials before spawning a browser tab that could potentially be a malware payload or something else malicious. Do you scan random QR codes with your phone, or do you trust your phone to be secure enough to handle them?",
