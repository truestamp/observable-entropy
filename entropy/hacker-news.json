      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I am in a bit of dilemma. I started a enterprise software startup with a bunch of friends in college, we got a bit of funding and I dropped out. We did couple hundred k in revenue and raised a bit more but eventually we couldn&#x27;t make it work. For past 2 years feels like I have been in a zombie startup and want to move on.<p>For people who have been in the same boat, what did you end up doing? As for getting ready to be in the job market again, what kind of positions did you end up applying for?<p>I am thinking either:<p>1) Join a seed&#x2F;series a startup as a developer and grow with them. Pros of this are this is what I know how to do best and love working in small teams<p>2) Join a more established bigger co. Pros are a more stable position but not sure it will be an environment i will be able to do well in",

      "text": "I am primarily concerned with app data.  I have many apps like messaging apps that have important private data such as contacts and message history that is difficult or impossible to export.  A big concern is if I lose my phone, there are some accounts that can only be recovered using the same phone number, which may be impossible if the  phone company refuses to issue another SIM card with the same number (a problem when traveling abroad).<p>So what do you guys do to get full (preferably offline) backups now that Android 12 has removed backup functionality from adb?  Is the only option to use a phone that can be rooted? (unfortunately not possible with my Samsung Fold 3 without disabling the camera).",
