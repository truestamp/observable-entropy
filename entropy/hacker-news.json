We posted the first time here more than a year ago when it was young. Now we&#x27;re at version 1.1.5. Our founder, a young Ukrainian woman, was severely wounded in the war and unfortunately passed away. We would like to state that our project is still alive. Still maintained. Still updated. Just changed URL from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anonymousplanet.org to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anonymousplanet-ng.org.<p>Any opinion or criticism would be welcome. It&#x27;s free, open-source, no ads, no affiliates, no sponsors. Any help would be welcome. Even if it&#x27;s just a follow on our twitter.
