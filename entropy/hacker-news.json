I would like to cut it completely out of my life.<p>I would like a way to stop being addicted to browsing Reddit, especially r&#x2F;popular. I have a Firefox browser extension that thankfully blocks access to r&#x2F;popular, r&#x2F;all etc. but I still search up random subreddits in the search bar.<p>The biggest problem is my phone where I have unlimited access (I browse even despite the terrible mobile browser experience).<p>I would like to only use Reddit in a search-engine form: I can only search for specific things but not start to just browse it regularly.<p>I&#x27;d love your opinions on how to eliminate this addiction from my life because it also does not fit in with the person I want to be. It&#x27;s not something that guy would do.",
