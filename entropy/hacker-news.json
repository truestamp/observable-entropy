You won&#x27;t get useless listicles because we&#x27;ll never crawl them. Relevant urls are harvested from HN, StackOverflow, programmer Reddit, and a few others. Page content comes mostly from the Common Crawl project.<p>The limited, but awesome, features in this first release are:<p>- Expressions! Experience the power of Elasticsearch’s Simple Query Strings.<p>- REST API. Just change &#x27;text&#x2F;plain&#x27; to `application&#x2F;json` in the above alias.<p>- CLI. Just use curl in the terminal. Simple as.<p>HackerNews, StackOverflow, Arxiv abstracts, 2M Github repos, and programmer Reddit (up to 2020) are being indexed right now. There&#x27;s much more to come in the next few months.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your questions, comments and suggestions in the comments below.",
