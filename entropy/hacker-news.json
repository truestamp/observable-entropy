      "text": "After many months of experiencing dizziness, I think I’ve finally tracked it down to monitor usage —- the dizziness was most prevalent after work, and was worse after busy days where I’ve been focusing hard and not taking breaks from the screen.<p>I’ve gotten a lot better by taking regular breaks (fully away from the desk every hour), following the 20&#x2F;20&#x2F;20 rule, and getting out for a walk at lunchtime. I also cut monitor and screen usage outside of work down.<p>Anyone else experienced something like this? I hear people regularly discussing eye strain, but not dizziness as such.",
