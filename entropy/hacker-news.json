      "text": "Hi all, I’m a full-stack JS developer with 7+ years of experience. I’m thinking of going fully remote and joining a dev platform that can offer me quality clients to work with.<p>I’m more keen on the curated platforms that would make it easier to reach the top end clients. Long-term projects are preferred over short. I’m based in Brazil so it has to be a platform that hires from Latam region.<p>What are your recommendations?",
