On the face of it, it works like an API but under the hood it works quite differently – there&#x27;s no cost, rate-limits or licensing restrictions.<p>This package is built on top of a new protocol called NUM [1], which is a way for companies to provide machine-readable data direct to devices, apps and services, over DNS.<p>To show what&#x27;s possible with this package we&#x27;ve built a UK Company Directory with a huge amount of data for many large companies [2].<p>The NUM protocol only recently launched in the UK so includes around 20m pieces of data about 5 million UK companies [3]. International roll out is planned next year.<p>0. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;company-api<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.num.uk&#x2F;developers<p>2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.companydirectory.uk&#x2F;barclays.co.uk&#x2F;contact-information<p>3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.num.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;we-crawled-5m-uk-websites-and-published-23m-data-points-to-dns",
