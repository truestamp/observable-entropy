      "text": "The existing todo apps are very useful to add things to a todo list and to organize them. These apps push us to keep adding things to the todo list. Indeed, some people confuse a) adding things to the todo list with b) actually doing them. We can go crazy about the organazation (colors, labels, projects etc.).  There is a lot that goes into the list and not a lot that goes out from the list. The list grows bigger and bigger until we reach a point of: &quot;I need to start again&quot;.<p>If you were asked to imagine some features that help taking things out of todo lists what would you suggest?",
