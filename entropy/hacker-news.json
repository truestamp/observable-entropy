      "text": "Several businessmen I know have had PPP loans that are forgiven, including one who got a payout over $1 million. Not one of their businesses actually lost money, so this just ended up being extra profit. Outside of restaurants and entertainment, it seems that the PPP loans were just a massive payout to the rich. How can we prevent such wasteful government handouts in the future? How can I avoid being demotivated as an entrepreneur when I see guys getting million dollar government payouts when I have to hunt and scrap to get deals in private enterprise? Is this just the end of capitalism?",
