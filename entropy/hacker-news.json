Try to attach the screenshot to a MS Teams message.<p>4. You will see an error stating that the image could not be uploaded.<p>5. Now take any other screenshot, e.g. a screenshot from Mozilla Thunderbird.<p>6. Attach the Thunderbird screenshot to a MS Teams message<p>7. This time, the screenshot will be attached without errors.<p>So, it seems the best email client to use in conjunction with MS Teams is Thunderbird :-p",
