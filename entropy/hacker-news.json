This is true on reddit, youtube, facebook, linkedin, and other sites. Each time just loading icon appears and then proceeded by completely random stuff. I.e. I&#x27;m scroll on reddit, I see few interesting things, I click one, it wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought but the other thing I read was looking good, I go back, it&#x27;s nowhere now.",
