      "text": "I’m a team lead but the job feels more like senior developer with some management responsibilities. In my previous job I had the same role but with much less hands on work and had the opportunity to lead multiple teams. I prefer that so I started looking for engineering management jobs.<p>Here are some stats: ~30 applications out of ~100 reviewed job postings. Got 7 interviews out of which I didn’t pass the first or second interview step in 4. In the remaining 3 I didn’t pass the last interview with the hiring director or VP. These 3 interview processes took me a lot of time and energy. On average I had 6 interviews in each of them.<p>I’m not happy at my current job but I really try to be positive and productive as much as I can. The interviews are taking significant portion of my time and that affects my performance. At my current job I’m in the middle of very complex project which causes me a lot of stress. I joined this company with no previous experience in their tech stack. Somehow that didn’t matter for them and me. I thought this would be similar job to the previous one where I didn’t do much IC work. It isn’t and I think I made a mistake. Actually I took this job because I didn’t get another manager job I was interviewing for at the same time and the salary was much better than the one I had.<p>I don’t think I can leave my job right now to have more time for the job search. The financial risk will just increase my stress and it will negatively affect my interviews.<p>For the interviews I think I do everything I should (obviously not) by learning about the companies and their products, answering to questions with real examples from my experience (combined with how you are supposed to answer leadership&#x2F;management questions), and being generally positive and enthusiastic about the jobs. I’m not getting feedback from the companies even when I ask. Which I guess is expected due to possible legal risk or they just don’t bother.<p>The reason I’m looking for manager instead of team lead roles is that I don’t think I’m good with  combining management and IC responsibilities. I feel way more confident when focusing only on one of them. I could go back to IC only role (I still get the thrill of solving problems with code) but I strongly prefer management responsibilities at this point. I understand that in a lot of companies managers are expected to be hands on but there are some that this is not the case and I got rejected at those.<p>So I really don’t know for how long I can keep doing this. It has been 4 months since I started looking for a new job and the current one is just getting more stressful due to mainly how I respond to the whole situation I’m in.<p>Does anyone with similar experiences have some ideas about how I can help myself?<p>I’ve been on hn for a long time, I just created this account for privacy reasons.",
