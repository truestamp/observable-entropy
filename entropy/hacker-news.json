      "text": "From https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;barinsta_updates :<p>Hello,<p>At approximately 21:33 UTC July 26 2021, I have been hit with a cease &amp; desist letter from a law firm repsenting Facebook. The letter was sent to one of my personal email address as well as Barinsta&#x27;s public inbox (and as a result, it is published). \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;austinhuang0131&#x2F;austinhuang0131&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2<p>In response, the source code has been taken down, and all promotional materials within my control has been adjusted to reflect the fact.<p>While I believe it is nearly impossible to fight a resourceful multinational firm and reinstate the app, we will still try to get as much resources as we could to navigate in this crisis.<p>At this dire moment, I ask you to do 1 thing: Please let others know what is happening here. Such bullying behaviour against a young university student is in no way excusable. Such bullying behaviour against many internet users is in no way excusable.<p>It has been an honour of a lifetime to serve as one of the main contributors of Barinsta. I am forever grateful for the countless supporters along the way.",
