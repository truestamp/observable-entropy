      "text": "I&#x27;m an aspiring founder and developer. I&#x27;ve worked on a few toy projects over the years, but have recently started on something that I believe has real potential.<p>I know next to nothing about the business side of things. I&#x27;ve been researching and learning, but its left me with questions. One such, at what stage in development should I begin fundraising?<p>Part of me feels like I should continue working on it during weekends and evenings until complete, and then start worrying about the &quot;business&quot; stuff. All the conventional wisdom however seems to argue against that and encourages swift market entry. How do I enter the market appropriately without funds? And how do I obtain funds without a fleshed out product or prior founding experience?<p>I have virtually 0 presence on professional social media outlets. No twitter, no IG, inactive linkedin, etc. My only viable options for marketing really is going to be paid ads. I&#x27;d also, ideally, like to be in a position to focus on this fulltime rather than worrying about it after my day job.<p>Now, it&#x27;d certainly be possible for me to just launch it one weekend and spend a few hour in the evenings managing things, but it&#x27;d seriously hamper growth and adoption.<p>Suggestion? Advice? Wisdom? I&#x27;m open to it all. Thanks in advance.",
