      "text": "So i am a junior software developer in a large consultant company and have my first salary negotitations soon and need some help.<p>I was told all juniors would increase the same in a sort of collective way since some did not get the same chances when it came to projects and performance, however my boss said there was a small change they would consider giving a larger raise based on performance.<p>I have been lucky and got a very good project, as in I could show my strengths and it&#x27;s a high value customer (within law enforcement). During the project i took a lot of initiative and responsibility, we were 3 developers working on it (2 seniors and me) and luckily one of them is my boss. The project is now being used by the customer and I am the only one maintaining the project and feeling I have taken even more responsibility than was expected.<p>The project was fairly large consisting of 2 frontends and one backend, where I made ~80% of both the frontends and did all the database work on the backend. To be honest being told that my performance wont impact my salary is kind of a bummer considering i have to wait another year for the next possible raise.<p>The project is now also being used as a reference to sell consultants to other customers and it has also garnered attention in nationwide news.<p>So my question to you is how should approach the salary negotiation and how should i present my case to my boss?<p>Sorry if this is incoherent, english is not my first language. Thanks.",
