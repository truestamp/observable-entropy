      "text": "First, some disclosure. I&#x27;m using a throwaway account given this has to do with my employment. I&#x27;m also being somewhat vague while providing enough high level detail to cover all the context.<p>Now that&#x27;s out of the way, as the title says I started a new job earlier this year and within two months members of the team began leaving the company. The second to last engineer of the team is on their way out now and while I understand now is the time for change for many people, I feel as if this puts me in a rather precarious position given my short time with the company and complexities of the work we do. All of the original domain knowledge has left, and I&#x27;m kind of stuck holding the bag should anything go south now.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned these are my options:<p>1. Ride it out, maybe ask for a raise and&#x2F;or promotion<p>2. Ask to be moved to another team<p>3. Start looking for a new position<p>This brings me to why I&#x27;m posting. What would other HN users do in this situation? Thank you for any input -- this is a first in my career as a developer.",
