      "text": "I lead product at Ubiq and we’re looking for beta testers to participate in our upcoming beta period in mid-September and we’ll hook you up with a $500 Amazon gift card!<p>If you’re not familiar with Ubiq, we’re a developer-first encryption-as-a-service platform, that enables developers to build client-side encryption directly into their applications, so they can keep their sensitive application data safe from hackers and insider threats! The platform is entirely API-based, doesn’t access any of your data, and handles the complexities of encryption key management and key storage. All you need to do is integrate a software client library and add a few lines of code!<p>So, here’s the deal. We’re about to release two new features: Format Preserving and Embedded Format Preserving Encryption (FPE&#x2F;eFPE) for applications written in C, Java and .NET. And we’re looking for beta testers to kick the tires on it and provide us their unfiltered feedback.<p>Skills you’ll need to bring to the table:\n -Proficiency in one or more of the following languages: C, Java and .NET\n -Better-than-average understanding of encryption concepts\n -Mid-level development skills in the implementation language for library usage\n -Basic Regex<p>What we’d expect of you:\n -Time commitment: a max of 2 hours a week over a 4-week cycle\n -Complete short weekly surveys\n -Active development and use of FPE functionality for an existing application e.g., regular encrypts&#x2F;decrypts throughout the 4-week cycle<p>What you can expect of us (rewards!):\n -Every tester that successfully completes the beta testing cycle will receive a $500 USD Amazon gift card. FYSA we can only issues gift cards in the USA, Canada, Hong Kong, and Japan\n -Additional vouchers and prizes (up to $1,000 USD in Amazon gift cards) will be awarded to testers that go “above and beyond” the standard tester participation requirements.<p>If you’re interested, please drop us a note at beta@ubiqsecurity.com with the subject line, “I’m interested in the upcoming beta”, and we’ll get you added to the list and then send out a short pre-beta survey!<p>Thanks a lot!<p>Wias<p>P.S. If you’re wondering what the heck Format Preserving Encryption is, we got your back: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Format-preserving_encryption",
