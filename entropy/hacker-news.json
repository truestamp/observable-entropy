It feels like the Github security team is asleep at the wheel when they let UI like this exist. Even the immediately linked documentation isn&#x27;t immediately actionable (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;developers&#x2F;apps&#x2F;building-oauth-apps&#x2F;scopes-for-oauth-apps).<p>Ideally, there should be a set of scopes recommended by their security team for different workflows&#x2F;applications&#x2F;scenarios... but without that being available from what I can see... I&#x27;ve come here.<p>Hackernews what are your recommended OAuth scopes for access tokens for different scenarios? What best practices are you following to keep your account secure?",
