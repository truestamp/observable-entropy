She is using an ad blocker (Adblock Plus on Safari) which does help with popups and advertising content but this often isn&#x27;t enough.  Any kind of motion on the page, while usually not enough to trigger a migraine, can be very distracting and frustrating for her.<p>Any suggestions on what she can try next?  Willing to switch browsers if necessary.  Thanks!",

      "text": "I can&#x27;t help, but notice a correlation between how I &quot;perform&quot; on interviews and how the stock market is doing. I feel like the days stocks are down I somehow don&#x27;t do as well on interviews. Note I don&#x27;t check the stocks before the interview. Yes, I am saying could it be that the people who are doing the interviews are affected by the market and if so would it be wise to not do interviews on down days by postponing the interview or another way? After all many people in tech have a stock portfolio and many check them regularly and this could affect their mood, etc.<p>Another strategy would be to not do interviews during high stock market volatility times.",
