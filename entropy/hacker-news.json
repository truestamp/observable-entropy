      "text": "When and why did we start splitting software engineering into front-end and back-end?<p>Was there a time when one could have been just a software engineer building websites or did the specialization was there since the beginning of HTML and CGI servers?<p>From Google Trends [1], it looks like maybe we started using this term in 2010.<p>My personal recollection: Around 2006 we had new projects like Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and JQuery which enabled additional complexity in HTML&#x2F;JS. In 2010, angular.js and backbone.js started and helped address a sentiment that JQuery was not good enough for large projects. It became hard for a software engineer to handle the new front-end frameworks while keeping up with the backend as well. So it would make sense to have the front-end engineer title introduced around this time. However, I don&#x27;t recall if there were explicit discussions or blog posts explicitly introducing it.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=all&amp;q=front%20end%20engineer,back%20end%20engineer",
