      "text": "I am fairly new to HN and I love the responses that I receive. However, the UI seems a little bit weird to me and I am wondering how others use the forum and UI.<p>E.g. I have observed that often people answer once but then do not follow up if there is a counter-question.<p>I prefer mutual conversations that clarify points and go deeper instead of one-shot answers. But. When I was trying to reply on posts, I had a hard time in order to find new answers to my posts. I solved it via skimming the whole conversation tree. That felt tedious.<p>Do I miss some UI features here? e.g. how to get notified or at least easily get transparency about answers to my comments? How to move things that I already read out of sight?<p>Maybe I am also using the wrong UI and the regulars use another one? e.g. algolia seems to provide a search interface which then links back to HN. Also, I have seen other apps create custom UIs. Maybe the regulars don&#x27;t even use the web interface but something else?",
