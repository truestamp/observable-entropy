      "text": "About me: I&#x27;m already proficient in C, C++, Javascript, and Scala.  I&#x27;m expertly adept at Java, Go, and Bash.<p>I am sold on the idea of Rust, it&#x27;s awesome.  I&#x27;ve played around with Rust and love it conceptually and philosophically.<p>When I sit down to actually learn it or start hacking on something, I&#x27;m consistently put off and frustrated by the steep learning curve in terms of being able to read and understand Rust programs.  The syntax is relatively complex compared to the other languages I know.  Everytime so far I&#x27;ve ended up overwhelmed and given up in frustration.<p>This is just for fun, there isn&#x27;t a professional driver pushing me every day to learn it.<p>I&#x27;m hoping for a better way than &quot;just push through it over and over until it becomes familiar&quot;.  Learning Go was a pleasure back in 2012, and I wish learning Rust felt similarly empowering, but sadly it&#x27;s felt opposite.<p>What is the most efficient and ideally fun way to gain proficiency in Rust?<p>Thank you!",
