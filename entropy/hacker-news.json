      "text": "I&#x27;m a longtime recreational user whose consumption increased greatly during recent periods of isolation. For most of my life I was never a &#x27;wake and bake&#x27; type but nowadays, having a job I can perform well in while under the influence, no other restrictions since I work from home, and being obliged (partly by pandemic effects, partly just from being a middle-aged suburbanite with strong introvert instincts in the first place) to focus on pastimes that I find strongly complementary to cannabis use – e.g. gaming, movies&#x2F;tv, home exercise, cooking – well, the upshot is that I eventually found myself partaking morning, noon, and night.<p>As drug habits go, it&#x27;s... pretty good! I still enjoy being high, though it feels way less special now that I indulge so often. There&#x27;s been no adverse effects on my work or home life, but I got tired of spending the money and I resent the feeling of dependency – much the same reasons I gave up cigarettes decades ago. So I&#x27;m cold turkey this week after a couple years of heavy use. For me the sense of withdrawal is, unsurprisingly, far less intense than it was with cigarettes, but it still nags.<p>I am curious about experiences other HNers may have had in making a similar transition away from frequent cannabis use. For what it&#x27;s worth, aside from staying home a lot, most of my habits are pretty healthy – I do a fair bit of exercise, eat well, drink alcohol sparingly, and on top of all that I am lucky enough to have a healthy work environment and a supportive partner at home (who doesn&#x27;t use cannabis but is about as perfectly neutral on the subject as anyone I&#x27;ve ever met). That is all helpful and good, but leaves me with few other options for swapping in healthier habits or making other compensatory changes.<p>Has anyone else here had this goal of trying to cut out or at least greatly diminish their use of cannabis, where one&#x27;s use has gotten rather out of hand but you&#x27;re still far from feeling the need to engage with professional help or sobriety organizations? And also – where it&#x27;s your last real vice, no one is forcing you to quit, and life is pretty mundane otherwise?",
