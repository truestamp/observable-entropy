Readers&#x2F;viewers can pay a monthly fee to subscribe to these groups and get access to the content shared by all the creators of that group (creators can also create their own groups).<p>You can think of it like Medium + SubStack but not only for writers. \nI&#x27;m still in the validation process so whether you like it or not, your feedback is valuable to me. So what do you think? I also have a Waiting List if you&#x27;re interested.",
