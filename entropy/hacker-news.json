So maybe suggest emotional argument angle?<p>I probably have one shot at trying to convince them to vaccinate so I am looking for possible any possible advice.<p>PS<p>Some talking points I am trying to use:<p>I have read papers on pregnancies and COVID vaccine - surprise nothing found.<p>Long term effects of vaccines would already show up<p>Delta and future variants are more likely to infect them even when self isolating<p>Covid death rates and Covid long term issues vs unknown mystery long term side effects of vaccine.",
