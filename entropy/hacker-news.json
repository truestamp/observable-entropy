Instagram seems to generate overly cosmetic &#x2F; vapid content. Stack Overflow and Quora encourage rule following and voluntary knowledge exchange.<p>Reddit&#x2F;Imgur generally encourage karma farming, but have lots of diverse incentives within communities.<p>I’m experimenting with a set of incentives for a site which can pay (in either points or perhaps crypto tokens) for quality questions and answers, but punish for low effort, low quality, spammy content. I’m also considering invite-based reputation sharing (like Russian hacking&#x2F;malware&#x2F;carder forums which require a vouch by a reputable member before a new member can join, thus tying the reputation of the voucher to the vouched).<p>I’m also considering being able to revoke or suspend reputation &#x2F; payouts and making it contagious to the user’s closest members.<p>Are there any examples of community incentives which have encouraged an abnormally strong community that didn’t pre-exist?",
