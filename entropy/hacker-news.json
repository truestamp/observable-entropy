      "text": "Hi HN! I had a joke idea, that morphed into something that might be practical - but I need some help validating the idea. Who here would be interested in the following:<p>Some people take games seriously and they want to make sure their dice are fair and balanced. I think they would want certified fair dice. Certifican could be accompanied by a video showing 1000 (or 10k or whatever) roles and statistical summary that all numbers are equally likely.<p>The rolls could be done via Robot, and unfair dice could be sold via as &quot;normal&quot; dice under a different brand to recoup cost or recycled.",

Atm, I feel overwhelmed,   one email after the other, demanding me to finish all the reports (all still in dev. stage for this new program). Sometimes I just stare at the screen, I couldn&#x27;t even start anything. And then there&#x27;s constant distraction (Ms teams, more emails...).<p>I got assigned to this new program where I have to build all the reports from scratch. I do like building and creating but it just got to a point when it feels overwhelming.<p>When I found out someone else is going to revamp everything that I created for the old program I was handling, I felt even more demotivated. No wonder I couldn&#x27;t even finish anything now.<p>I was promised of promotion and wage increase this quarter but now I feel like I wont be getting it as I cannot fulfill the demands anymore.",
