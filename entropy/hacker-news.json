      "text": "Recently a journalist approached me to see whether I would be interested in speaking about what it was like to work there. 10K+ head count, triple that previously employed; this place is known for itâ€™s bad staff retention. I imagine they have realized this and doing some reality check with the old staff to materialize. Have you spoken at all? What are the nonobvious risks?",

      "text": "Many restaurants moved to touchless menus during the pandemic. The restaurant owners need a solution to host their existing digital menus (in PDF) online and give QR codes to their customers. When customers scan the QR codes, they can view the menus on mobile and order in person.<p>I built a website for this simple use case last night. I&#x27;m planning to get first 100 users and validate product market fit in next few weeks. The basic functionalities will always be free. I probably will be able to monetize by offering tracking and analytics. I don&#x27;t know if there is a strong need for ordering food on mobile. Some restaurants certainly do this. However heavy automation in the ordering process creates a different dining experience which may not fit all restaurants.<p>I&#x27;m not a frontend engineer by any means. The UI is very primitive. I can also open source the project if there&#x27;s any interest.",
