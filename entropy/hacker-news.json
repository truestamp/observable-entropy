      "text": "Looking for some advice here -<p>I&#x27;m a non-technical jack-of-all-trades who can handle marketing, design, sales, etc. A few months ago, I approached a friend who&#x27;s quite strong as a developer to work on a side project that has positive feedback from the early user research I&#x27;ve done. We agreed to split equity evenly.<p>However, they have not contributed over the last few months (no line of code started), despite me checking in and reporting my progress. When I ask, they said they are busy with work, which is understandable as we both have full-time jobs in tech. However, when I ask them if they were still interested continuing at all, they insisted that they were.<p>What gives? I&#x27;d rather them tell me upfront if they weren&#x27;t interested in continuing, instead of dragging out for who knows how long. I&#x27;m also tired of checking in with no updates.<p>Any advice for how I should handle this situation?",
