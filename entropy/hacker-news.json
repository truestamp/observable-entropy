      "text": "Hiya HN!<p>Just released Artillery Probe - a Swiss army knife for testing HTTP from the CLI. Think mini-curl with better UX for common use-cases, plus a couple of extra features.<p>Would love for you to try it and give some feedback!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artillery.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;swiss-army-knife-for-http-testing<p>and:<p><pre><code>  npm install artillery@latest\n</code></pre>\nWhat does it do?<p>- First of all, it&#x27;s a HTTP client! It does all the usual stuff you&#x27;d expect from a HTTP client... HTTP methods, request bodies, custom headers, forms, Basic Auth etc.<p>- Got some JSON or XML back? It&#x27;ll pretty-print it, and syntax highlight it for you.<p>- It&#x27;ll show you request waterfalls like this one: (inspired by httpstat)<p><pre><code>   DNS Lookup | TCP Connection | SSL Handshake | Time to First Byte | Content Transfer\n    56ms      |  14ms          |     19ms      |     181ms          |   88ms          |\n              |                |               |                    |                 |\n              56ms             |               |                    |                 |\n                            70ms               |                    |                 |\n                                             89ms                   |                 |\n                                                                  270ms               |\n                                                                                 total:358ms\n</code></pre>\n- JSON responses can be queried and sliced and diced with JMESPath (same syntax as AWS CLI) - no need to reach for jq. XML &amp; HTML may be queried with a jQuery-like syntax too.<p>- You can set expectations on the response, e.g. have the CLI check that the response is a 200, or that a certain header is set, and exit with non-zero code if not. Super handy for quick acceptance testing.<p>We&#x27;ve got lots of ideas for improvements, but would love to hear what you think!",
