He says, if he recalls correctly, the tape would have contained 2 file, EBCDIC encoded, written by an IBM utility using a tape sub-system attached to a s&#x2F;360 processor running MVS.<p>Assume the IBM guys have this setup in some dusty basement in upstate New York.<p>This is a 2 part question.  What is the best method for attempting to read this mag tape?  That’s the main question.  Second, what is the probability of success here?  Assume the tape was kept in a climate controlled home.",
