      "text": "I just listened to several CS heavy interviews with Lex and several guests. Knowing nothing about the host I would have assumed that he has no hire education at all, let alone a Ph.D. in CS from MIT. Am I wrong?<p>As far as I am concerned he lucked out because someone got him into MIT and he lucked out the second time because he got on the Joe Rogan podcast. The rest is history. But I was just amazed how dumb the man sounds on his own podcast and the quality of guests he gets.<p>I&#x27;ll be honest, I am probably jealous, but damn, I almost think like his podcast has negative value. Every time his guests speaks I get smarter, every time he speaks I just get angry that someone this dumb got this lucky.",
