      "text": "For my next review my boss has asked me to talk about the latest and greatest marketing guff. He is an ad man through and through and really he just wants to see me get excited about the latest marketing gimick and sell him on the idea. When the conversation moves to price we won&#x27;t have the money for it so I won&#x27;t have to worry about implementing the idea if its unrealistic.<p>The more out there the idea the better he will like it, think advertising banners flying behind drones. Last time I talked about facebook chatbots as it was the latest fad at the time but whats new? Whats the latest fad that gets your boss excited?",
