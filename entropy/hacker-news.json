      "text": "Per multiple HN disucssions I have understood to value equity in startups a 0$.\nI am working for a startup that is on track to IPO within the next year or so. I have some share options as part of my contract that allows me to buy shares at a certain strike price.\nI am in the dark on how I should value this.\nAre these share options actually transferred 1:1 into a share after an IPO? Is there a possibility of a reverse split?\nI am quite lost on how to value this as I am considering moving to a new company and want to understand if I am potentially making a financial mistake by leaving.\nCan anyone point me to some good ressources on this?\nThanks",
