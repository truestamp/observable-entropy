(Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 17529.) An email ad is unsolicited if you have not given direct consent to receive ads and you don’t have a preexisting or current relationship with the advertiser.<p>- California law also prohibits commercial email ads in California that:<p><pre><code>    - Have a subject line that a person knows would be likely to mislead a reasonable recipient about a material fact about the contents or subject matter of the message.\n</code></pre>\n- It is vital to note that the law holds advertisers, not just Spammers, liable for violation of the law:<p><pre><code>    1. Private parties receiving such e mail may sue for damages, attorneys fees and costs.\n\n    2. If the advertisement violates the above provisions, liquidated damages of one thousand dollars per advertisement (with a cap of one million dollars per incident) are available.\n\n    3. The new law also grants California electronic mail service provides (including ISPs) the right to bring their own civil actions, including liquidated damages of up to twenty five thousand dollars per day against advertisers that violate the provider’s policies of unsolicited electronic mail advertisements.\n</code></pre>\nMore about this spammer&#x2F;harvester&#x2F;scammer:<p>- On Trustpilot: review&#x2F;myremotedevelopers<p>- On Trustpilot: reviews&#x2F;5f1d13471a5a69071c95c5d0<p>- On Trustpilot: reviews&#x2F;5ee263b57dd753070880fbc9<p>- On Trustpilot: reviews&#x2F;5e8998ab086b6409bc7d872b<p>- On Trustpilot: reviews&#x2F;5e85e32e086b6409b0e58660<p>- On Crunchbase: organization&#x2F;optimhire<p>The corporate spammer&#x2F;scammer even wrote an annual salary range the started from below minimum wage.
