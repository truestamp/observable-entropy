      "text": "Like many others, I rely on photos to document my memories. Over time, I’ve come to realize that they’re not very good at it. Memories need stories, and photos can’t tell stories. Lookback is my take on what I think a better solution looks like.<p>It’s basically a photo sharing app that lets you attach video messages (stories) to photos and share them privately. When your invites watch your memory, they&#x27;ll hear your story play while scrolling through your photos, just like they would if you were looking at the photos together in-person. They can reply by adding their own photos and video messages, creating a shared memory of stories and photos that you can tap into and relive anytime you want.<p>Now instead of looking at old photos and wishing I remembered more, I can look at old photos and hear my friends and family relive every detail.<p>Looking forward to feedback from the HN community.",
