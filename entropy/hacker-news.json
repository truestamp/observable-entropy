      "text": "Okay, this might not be a revelation to the Lispers, but as I am neither a Web developer nor a Lisp developer it was an epiphany for me! I am a systems software engineer(work mostly in C and C++) so this was &quot;hmm...?&quot; moment for me.<p>I understand(by reading various comments across the web) that web essentially can be treated as functional i.e a request can have no state and side effect(though that could make an app useless). And also that everything in Lisp is a list. Please correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.<p>Now, for sometime I have been toying with web app ideas and trying to develop various apps using C++(yep, web development in C++! :D). I come up with architecture for a web app, develop for a few days; feel unsatisfied with the design and throw it away. This has been going on for sometime now. But today, I was thinking of a backend design for one of the web apps, and it has most of the common features you see in regular everyday apps. While jotting down the high-level design I unconsiously started treating everything as list! So [web] apps can be developed in a functional way, and everything can be treated as list. Hmmm...where did I hear that before? :)",
