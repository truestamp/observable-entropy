      "text": "I work at a very stable, mid-sized company. We have ~ 1,500 clients. Our internal site, which we share with clients who have their own creds, is built on an ancient tech stack. An IBM DB2 server with vanilla php 5.4. We are still using iframes and tables for layout. It ... mostly works, except if you try to use it on mobile&#x2F;small screens. We manually build SQL statements. We do not use classes. There is no CSS, only a few inline styles here and there. We use a proprietary, old IDE and will not be changing because of existing devs.<p>I am a relatively new web dev, ~ 3-4 years experience (but with wife and kids that whole time, so not much free time). The other 2 devs at the company have been there a LONG time. One is dedicated to sys&#x2F;db&#x2F;running the business, the other is web&#x2F;client facing. They don&#x27;t seem very interested in using new tech.<p>The boss has asked me to experiment with my own web server, Laravel, and a PowerBI gateway for analytics, but I&#x27;m completely on my own and pretty swamped with basic stuff like manually building forms. What would you do to help get this business up to speed?",
