Just incorporated but got confused by the information all around.\nLooking for advice here. \nSince I still have a 9-5 job (yes I know I know..but have a family to feed), adding payroll to the Corporation that has no profit doesn&#x27;t make sense to me tax wise.\nIs there any issue (law&#x2F;tax, etc) if I don&#x27;t pay myself a salary from the corp? When do founders in similar situation usually add themselves to payroll? \nThank you in advance for replying.",
