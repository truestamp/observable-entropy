      "text": "I&#x27;m curious if there are paid programs for early-stage startups that you think are worth investing in? Especially for non-technical founders who want to meet technical people. I am aware of YC&#x27;s Startup School (a great start), but I think paid programs are likely to have more direct mentorship, accountability, and community and those are valuable to me. On Deck now operates like YC - paying for equity, but programs like it? I&#x27;m especially interested in programs that foster non-traditional founders or ethical&#x2F;social impact tech.",
