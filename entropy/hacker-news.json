      "text": "So this idea has been on my mind for a while...<p>I absolutely hate writing Open API documents in yaml by hand. GUI tools like StopLight Studio are a bit better, but still don&#x27;t really cut it for me.<p>I don&#x27;t like generating it from code either because it tends to clutter everything and devs usually get too much confident and don&#x27;t bother to make sure that the output is good enough.<p>So, ever since I saw the aws-cdk I can&#x27;t stop thinking that this approach would be a perfect solution for generating Open API docs in a much more dev-friendly way.<p>There&#x27;s a list of features that we would get out of the box:<p>- Language bindings for popular languages through jsii (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;jsii) (same tech behind aws-cdk).\n- Type checks and autocomplete.\n- I18n.\n- Support for js modules and npm packages.\n- Easy CICD integration.\n- Git-friendly.\n- Live-reload preview though webpack-dev-server or similar.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a very rough and unfinished POC here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marcmarcet&#x2F;openapi-cdk&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;packages&#x2F;demo&#x2F;bin&#x2F;app.ts<p>Do you guys think this could get any interest from the community?",
