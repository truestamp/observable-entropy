But it would seem that at the time of the article being written that the standard was more of a guideline than actual rules.<p>If anything, cars have become even more reliant on the software that they use since the article was written, and I am not so certain that manufacturers have stepped up their software quality practices along side that development.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?q=Toyota+unintended+acceeleration+and+the+big+bowl+of+spaghetti+code<p><i>&#x2F;edit:</i> spelling",
