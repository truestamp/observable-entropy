      "text": "Hello,<p>I‘ve left a company (startup) after 6 months of internship although I’ve already signed a full time contract (cancelled that too). It was just too toxic for me and I got gas lighted a lot. Then I got a bad behaviour mark (in Germany we have something what’s called a certificate of employment). I’ve heard that there is an unspoken rule that you have to work for at least a year before leaving. Now I’m hesitating putting that specific work experience into my resume (new employer might do a background check and call). I’m about to finish my bachelors degrees and I don’t have a lot of work experience to offer aside from team projects. How should I go about this? It’s been a year now since I‘ve left.",
