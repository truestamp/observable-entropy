People say the hardest part is marketing but repetitive development is very boring. I will definitely choose a fun-ner side project than this if this fails. It&#x27;s such a tiring journey as a solo developer&#x2F;founder&#x2F;marketer.<p>The tech stack is Node.js and Angular.<p>Daspoll is a survey builder for everyone.",
