I&#x27;ve tried using it with two difference cameras (both from Logitech), and result is the same. If I switch to built in camera on laptop - everything si great. If I open Google Meet in Firefox - external USB cameras work great.<p>Is there some plugin for Chrome that would tell &quot;If the domain is meet.google.com start Firefox and go to that URL&quot;?",
