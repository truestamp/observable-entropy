      "text": "Seems to me the idea that Putin wants to resurrect the Russian Empire is a red herring excuse to funnel money to the MIC. It would be more logical for the USA and Europe to be friends with Russia even if the price to pay is a neutral, non-EU ukraine. The current situation makes about as much sense as if we sacrificed our friendship with the UK to support Ireland in a violent take over of Northern Ireland. What does Ukraine bring to the table that is worth destablizing Europe for?",

Or those presenters are drawing and making the presentations themselves.<p>Long ago, when I was young and more into presenting there were the bundles that one could buy and add to MS PowerPoint and use freely. I do not know if that is still the case or if it has changed since then.<p>If the presenters are mostly drawing their own clip arts, what hardware and software are the most commonly used?",
