      "text": "I&#x27;m currently working on some software targeted at mathematicians. Part of this requires that the user can write parsers to parse custom notation. I would expect most mathematicians interested in this project to know at least some basic programming but I also think it would be too difficult to expect them to write a full recursive descent parser or similar for their own notation. My current plan is to expose a simple parser combinator library alternatively I was thinking of a parser generator instead. But I was wondering if there is an option which is even simpler for users. What is the simplest way to allow users to write custom parsers?",

      "text": "I am a software developer in my 30s. It seems like in today&#x27;s market, my &quot;value&quot; (which translates to salary + benefits) to a company continues to increase as my years of experience grows. Right now, it seems like swapping companies every few years is a good way to &quot;accrue value&quot;.<p>Looking around at my current company, co-workers in their 50s seem resistant to job swap. I would guess this is because they require security before moving into retirement. Without moving, their &quot;value&quot; may continue to increase, but surely at a slower rate than the market.<p>At what point does your value to a company begin to stagnate&#x2F;decrease&#x2F;slow down? Is there a combination of age and experience where company swapping is not such a good idea? Does moving to management maximise value increase?",
