We&#x27;ve wasted 6 weeks of our project so far because non-engineers have been trying to design engineering solutions that we eventually had to explain weren&#x27;t necessary&#x2F;optimal&#x2F;possible, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I have enough political&#x2F;social capital to raise the issue directly, and everyone else seems too timid.<p>Has anyone been here before?
