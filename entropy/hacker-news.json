      "text": "Hi Hacker News!<p>It&#x27;s safe to say that we all enjoy some quality apps on our phones. But guess what, there&#x27;s a certain industry that&#x27;s still clinging to the usability and security standards from the desktop era of the 2010s. Poorly designed UIs, bombardments of ads, random popups, scams, etc. This industry operates in such a shady way that we as users rather keep their products in incognito mode.<p>We say no more and offer you the following solution<p>USER EXPERIENCE\n Mobile first and native-like UI design.\n Beautiful dark mode that&#x27;s easy on your eyes.\n Instant navigations, smooth scrolling, touch gestures.\n⬇ Can be added to the home screen for fullscreen and quick access (PWA).\n No annoying ads and popups.<p>PRIVACY PROTECTION\n All data is stored locally in browser storage. No personal information is sent to servers.\n  All functionality is available without sign up or other personal identification.\n No Google Analytics. Instead, we use the privacy-focused Fathom Analytics (usefathom.com).\n No URL paths that expose information in the browsing history. Forward&#x2F;back navigation still works perfectly.<p>INCLUSIVITY\n Only personal (and verified) accounts allowed. No studios or brands. This means that all available content has been approved by their actors and was created consensually.\n We welcome all types of sexual orientation and try to provide the best possible service to all of our users.<p>Please note that this product is only intended for persons over the age of 18.<p>Happy swiping!",

We’re super excited to officially launch PSPDFKit API [1].<p>PSPDFKit API is a collection of HTTP APIs that enable you to convert, generate, and edit documents without running any service on your infrastructure.<p>What differentiates our API from others is that you can chain together multiple “actions” as part of a single API request. For example, you can convert, OCR, watermark, edit, and flatten a document — all in one call.<p>Available actions [2]:<p>- PDF Generator<p>- PDF Converter<p>- Image Converter<p>- OCR<p>- Watermark<p>- Merge<p>- Split<p>- Duplicate<p>- Delete<p>- Flatten<p>Our documentation includes sample code for JavaScript [3], Python [4], Java [5], C# [6], PHP [7], and the command line.
