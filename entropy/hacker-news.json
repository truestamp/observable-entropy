Just now going home, my pickup spot clearly showed around the corner on another street, but the driver said his pickup spot was out front of the building, about 75m away. Shit like this is every second ride now for at least a month.<p>I&#x27;m an Australia, but I wonder if this is a symptom of the internal state of Uber.",
