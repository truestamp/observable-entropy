      "text": "I started a new job half a year ago as a senior full stack engineer. There is one coworker who routinely reviews my PRs and leaves feedback that clearly demonstrates they didn&#x27;t read my code closely or they didn&#x27;t fully grok it. I then have to go out of way my to prove to this person the code is doing what is expected&#x2F;asked, either in long winded responses on the PR, or sometimes as far as pulling them into a video call to screen share and live debug the code to them. It&#x27;s becoming increasingly annoying, and even a little exhausting which is hurting my motivation and delivery throughput. Anyone ever had similar experiences or have any tips to deal with this type of situation?",
