      "text": "Hello everyone,<p>With a couple of friends, we&#x27;ve been working hard on a fintech project for a few months. It will be a banking app with 2 main features :<p>1. A credit card that allows you to spend money\n2. AND a new kind of savings account that offers higher yields (Can go up to 20%) (better than traditional savings accounts)<p>Too good to be true ? We use Blockchain and Decentralized Finance to build our savings accounts and provide such high rates. If you want more details on how it works or want to be informed of the project&#x27;s progress, please send &quot;interested&quot; to the following email : karim.rkha-chaham@hec.edu<p>Cheers",
