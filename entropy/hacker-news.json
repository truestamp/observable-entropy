      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I just launched a specialty online bakery creating no-sugar-added, low-carb, gluten-free cookies and cookie sandwiches called RAIZE (eatraize.com).<p>Instead of sugar, we use a blend of natural sweeteners including stevia, monk fruit, and erythritol. Instead of grains, we use almond, hazelnut, and coconut flours.<p>Why? The key to long-term metabolic health (including fat loss, reducing energy spikes&#x2F;crashes, lowering inflammation, and more) is to avoid blood sugar spikes (see the company Levels Health for more info on this). This means eating less sugar and fewer refined, high glycemic carbohydrates like traditional flour.<p>Prior to RAIZE, the &quot;better-for-you&quot; dessert alternatives consistently left me dissatisfied, and there was no good fresh bakery option. So, I partnered with a classically-trained pastry chef who formerly led the baking program at one of the top culinary schools to develop our recipes and launch RAIZE.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to still enjoy dessert while eating less sugar and fewer refined carbs, check us out at eatraize.com. We deliver nationwide.<p>Let me know if you have any feedback or questions!",

So I guess my questions are: where do I start? Should I find a community, read a book, get an app? What language should I learn, or does it even matter? Please, if anyone has any advise I would love to learn more!",
