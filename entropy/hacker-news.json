      "text": "G interview process was unexpectedly slow, I started interviewing with them in Oct last year. After figuring out they will take forever, i started interviewing at other companies and in JUNE, they have given me an offer but I&#x27;m already almost 6 months in at a new company. I want to leave for Google, however, it&#x27;d be mean throwing away my prorated sign on bonus and also undo vested stocks. More than 100k+ loss.<p>Is there a way to tell G I accept the offer but I will start next year 2nd quarter.<p>Because that is unreasonable way of doing things",
