      "text": "Hi friends,<p>I am trying to help a friend avoid a really serious problem in their website. Here is the scenario:<p>They open an access for admission form at 9:00am in certain days. After they close admission, they chose the first person who filled the form and award them the admission.<p>My question is: Is it possible for a hacker or a technically knowledgeable person to prevent access for others for a few seconds and submit his&#x2F;her request before anyone else?<p>I have tried the form in the specific time. There is a countdown until the form shows up, and then a server error occurs for a few seconds before the form shows up. I was thinking this is maybe because of too many requests, but the number of users who visit the website is not more than a thousands people.<p>Anyone has any idea if manipulation could take place in such a case?<p>Thanks a lot,",
