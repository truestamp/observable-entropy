      "text": "Howdy.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on learning Spanish. I moved to Puerto Rico (I&#x27;m a SE contractor) and am studying using a variety of resources including memrize, Quizlet &amp; various books &amp; PDFs. Not a big fan of Duolingo, I&#x27;ve used it extensively in the past.<p>Usually when I start learning something new, I get an idea of how it could be taught better. Looking for feedback on this idea.<p>It feels like the way to break past the beginner plateau is reading immersion. However, it&#x27;s very difficult to find easy to read stories for a beginner.<p>My little sister learned to read by using Bob Books. The stories started with simple sentences like &quot;Bob has a broom&quot;, &quot;Jill hit bob&quot;, &quot;Bob was angry&quot;. Gradually, they introduced more complicated stories.<p>The idea:<p>Build a Spanish learning course that&#x27;s centered around introducing core glue-vocabulary and grammatical structures, then provides stories &amp; comprehension quizzes written in Spanish for the language learner to reinforce the lessons. Vocab &amp; grammar is first introduced, then used in the stories.<p>Users can click on words if they don&#x27;t remember them, and they&#x27;ll be automatically added to their vocab study deck (based on spaced-repetition).<p>Gradually, the stories &amp; comprehension quizzes will get more complicated as more grammar structures &amp; vocab is introduced.<p>If there&#x27;s a course out there that&#x27;s like this, LMK. This seems like it would be way more effective &amp; motivating than studying random generated sentences &amp; phrases out of context like duolingo.<p>I&#x27;m looking for feedback, and potentially a spanish-speaker that would be interested in helping me write stories &amp; structure the course.
