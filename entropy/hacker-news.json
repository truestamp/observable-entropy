      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I had some christmas free time over the last two weeks (Merry Christmas btw ;-)) and used that time to completely recreate the website of my app[1]. I used all the fancy new tools. I didn&#x27;t know some of them when I started.<p>What was my goal?<p>* Pretty website<p>* Blazing fast<p>* Mobile first<p>* SSR<p>* Webp support<p>* Generally all the best website practices (high lighthouse score)<p>What did I use?<p>* Tailwindcss (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindcss.com&#x2F;)<p>* Tailwind Components (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailwindui.com&#x2F;)<p>* React (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactjs.org&#x2F;)<p>* ViteJs (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitejs.dev&#x2F;)<p>* Kubernetes (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;)<p>Well what can I say. I hate creating websites, but this was an awesome experience. Never have I created a website more efficiently. Tailwindcss + Components is just the best. ViteJS is so so so much easier to setup compared to webpack and has SSR support on top of it. React has been around somewhat longer and I did a lot of projects with it, so that was a nobrainer. Special thanks to all the people who created these awesome tools.<p>PS: If you work with lots of images, do yourself a favor and use something like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JonasKruckenberg&#x2F;imagetools. It saved me hours of dreadful work.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stockevents.app",
