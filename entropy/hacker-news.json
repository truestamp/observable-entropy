      "text": "I&#x27;m currently working on a tiny task management web application for my own needs. To minimize the implementation work I came up with a concept that I think could suit a number of applications like this as well:<p>- No user signup (no backend at all)<p>- Local first (via localstorage)<p>- Optional bring-you-own-storage functionality for sync and backup<p>The last point would allow the user to provide, say, an S3 endpoint and api key to allow the application to synchronize its state to a remote data store. By supplying the same credentials to the application on another device, one would have cross-device sync effectively for free. To avoid exposing data to the storage provider I&#x27;m also implementing client-side encryption.<p>Now the only remaining question is what storage protocol to use. I&#x27;ve found S3 client libraries to be severely lacking for browser environments (the AWS SDK is a mess and seems to rely on nodejs shims to work, not to mention its gargantuan size).<p>What are other easy to use and widely available storage protocols? WebDAV? A git repo?\nCurious to hear what else is out there!",
