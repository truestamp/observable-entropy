      "text": "Was watching the NBA finals last night and decided to play around with the $5 that was in my Draftkings account when this question came to mind.<p>I imagine there is some API that a lot of the apps use for their lines. But super curious about how they make these just out of genuine curiosity, both for team matchups and player stat over&#x2F;unders.<p>Think it would make sense to incorporate historical performance, maybe higher impact on recency like if a team&#x2F;player is hot, maybe also a focus on player matchups, home-field advantage. Wonder if they incorporate who is reffing or other kind of more quirky factors?<p>Not building anything in this space just was curious. I envisioned that some gambling software legend lurks here sometimes and might bite at the poor question.",
