      "text": "Recently came across a posting for a Director level technical role where the initial remote interview involves a coding test. Personally I consider coding tests not very useful, as I can learn more about a candidate in interactive discussions about problems and solutions, where I can see what their thought process is instead of what test questions they can answer from memory.<p>While I believe that the best management is capable of understanding the work their team does, coding tests for director level positions is a red flag, because it brings up a question of what they really want to hire for.<p>Does the audience here agree, or is it possible my distaste for coding tests is coloring my perspective?",
