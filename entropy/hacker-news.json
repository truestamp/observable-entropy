For instance I&#x27;ve forked their open source code, provided features people like etc etc.<p>I have 3.6YOE as a backend dev, no existing PM experience other than a role at a previous growth stage company I worked for.  Long story short, I really want to work for them but their offer was low ($120k w&#x2F; benefits), more than 15% less than what I currently make at a no-name startup.<p>I suck at leetcode, but at this point I&#x27;m weighing my options as to whether I should stick it out for a few months (grinding leet) and chase far better money as a dev or spend a year at this new TPM gig, take a bit of a $$ hit to speed up the transition &#x2F; career hack of not needing to switch to PM work internally and later take the PM track at FAANG and largely have a better chance at high TC than I would as an engineer?<p>I&#x27;m mostly worried about how difficult it would be to get back into dev work, if I either dislike PM work or realize I have better TC potential as an engineer.",
