      "text": "One thing I have seen over and over again in many organizations is that a new product is designed and implemented from scratch, using a fairly logical and sensible structure &#x2F; architecture.<p>For example, maybe there is a frontend that connects to three separate backend servers, A, B, and C, which all handle some different, self-contained logical thing. Or maybe things are divided into key classes A, B and C, each of which encapsulates a self-contained piece of functionality. It&#x27;s possible for A or B to fail without affecting C. If B crashes, you know it is due to a problem with some particular feature. It&#x27;s all quite sensible and easy to reason about.<p>Then, later, after go-live... a new, unrelated major feature D is added. Instead of creating a new backend server or class to implement D, it is shoe-horned into the existing A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C backend server or classes or whatever. And then feature, E, feature F, etc... all shoehorned into whatever the original architecture &#x2F; components were, instead of adding dedicated new components for D and E and F, just like happened for A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C.<p>Obviously, over time, this just leads to a big mess. Not only do you not end up with a dedicated, self-contained implementation for D, you also destroy the dedicated, self-contained components you originally had for A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C in the process, and after a bit of time it turns into a big unstructured mess.<p>I always find this kind of bizarre, because often the original structure is pretty sensible, and all that&#x27;s required is to continue applying the same reasoning and techniques to new features as was applied to the original ones.<p>Sometimes there are administrative disincentives that encourage this, like requiring some onerous approval for a &quot;new&quot; server &#x2F; class &#x2F; source file, but a lightweight process for a &quot;change&quot; to an existing thing... but for the most part it just seems to be odd that people can&#x27;t apply more of what&#x27;s already in front of them, instead of destroying it.",

      "text": "So long story short, I was in Bali just before COVID and decided to stick around...for 3 years. After freelancing as a designer&#x2F;developer for nearly a decade I decided to look for a remote job - cuz why the fuck not everyone was hiring remote. I applied and got a job posted for &#x27;hybrid&#x27; work - took 2 months to convince them I would do the work and come back in the summer (traditional finance company not used to remote ).<p>Over the past 3 months, I solo built an entire application from scratch that was presented to the Board 3 times which my boss says they&#x27;re all ecstatic about. He mentioned the head of the project doesn&#x27;t know I exist - thinks my boss made the entire thing. CEO, President, etc. all know about the project and are excited about &#x27;my bosses project&#x27;. Basically the head of the project passed on sketches and screenshots of excel sheets which my boss would give me one sentence of what to build, no design. Usually, I don&#x27;t give a fuck but it&#x27;s different as a freelancer working directly with clients - definitely stings the ego thinking I was part of the company and having put in all the effort. Have I been freelancing so long I just forgot that&#x27;s how office work hierarchy goes? Kinda makes me wanna say  and go back to freelancing.<p>I&#x27;m moving back to NJ to be &#x27;hybrid&#x27; beginning of August...Do I mention to the head of the project the first time I meet him that I built the entire app or just let my boss have his glory and mention I&#x27;m on the team that helped build it?  Don&#x27;t want bad blood with the boss as he&#x27;s a nice guy and gives me freedom, but don&#x27;t mind if I need to find another job as I&#x27;m not stoked on this company and I&#x27;m financially stable.<p>I guess more generally...do more people in remote companies also feel not being acknowledged for their work?",
