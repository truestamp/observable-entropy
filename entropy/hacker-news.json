      "text": "I’ve been meaning to create a tech blog for a long time. Would it be unethical to fudge the published date on some blog posts I wrote but never publishe ( because I had no blog ). For example I wrote a post about my presentation at Oracle Open World in 2018…. But it would seem weird if I wrote about my 2018 presentation in 2022. What’s everyone’s thoughts on fudging the date on my blog ( IE say the post was written in 2018 )?",
