      "text": "I live in Europe after growing up in the States. Every now and then, a link to an interesting news article is suggested to me. Clicking the link, I see this text:<p><pre><code>  Our European visitors are important to us.\n  \n  This site is currently unavailable to visitors from the European Economic Area while we\n  work to ensure your data is protected in accordance with applicable EU laws.\n</code></pre>\nFor my European friends, try a link like &lt;www.everythinglubbock.com&gt; or &lt;www.tristatehomepage.com&gt; or &lt;www.khon2.com&gt; or &lt;www.wtrf.com&gt; or &lt;www.wnct.com&gt; or &lt;www.fox46.com&gt; ... or many of the other &quot;local&quot; news sources in the U.S. It&#x27;s important to note: While these sites cover news in a particular region, we&#x27;d need to start calling each McDonald&#x27;s a local burger joint under this classification.<p>At the bottom of each page: &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nexstar.tv&gt; - If you click <i>this</i> link, you are <i>not</i> geoblocked! In fact, there are a ton of statistics showing just how many resources this media group has at their disposal to address releasing news articles to Europe. Save a click. It&#x27;s 4 billion USD revenue, over 100 news sites and TV stations, and a reach into two-thirds of American households. This is no mom and pop operation. They just don&#x27;t---or maybe <i>can&#x27;t</i>---care.<p>I only focused on one media group, but there are others. Here&#x27;s a news article from the same year GDPR began enforcement two years after its introduction in 2016: &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-44248448&gt;<p>A little has changed, but not much! Chicago Tribune is finally available. NY Daily News? Can&#x27;t access. Baltimore Sun or Orlando Sentinel? Also, no.<p><i>&quot;Why are you complaining?&quot;</i> you might ask. <i>&quot;What is your goal?&quot;</i><p>Besides the obvious---I&#x27;d like to read about the communities of my friends and former neighbors---I want two outcomes:<p>First, any giant search engine company with a news subdomain and 100,000 employees could stop suggesting&#x2F;featuring geofenced articles to European residents. At least weight these results so they aren&#x27;t the number one, front page feature. (Although in Google&#x27;s defense, one can usually click the &quot;Cached&quot; button to get the linked story.)<p>Second, say something else. The people living across the Atlantic (and their pesky differences of opinion on privacy) can&#x27;t possibly be more than an inconvenience at this point.<p><pre><code>  You are in Europe. Mind your own business.\n</code></pre>\n---<p>Edit: First post. No idea how to get links to display properly even following &quot;Formatting Options&quot; instructions.",
