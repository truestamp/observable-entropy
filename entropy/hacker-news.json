They appear to make these cloud options seem sexy while it&#x27;s also very hard to move away from a cloud system once it&#x27;s built. By sexy, I mean people like to build things how Google builds things and Resume-driven development means that this can result in higher salaries for the people using these tools.<p>This might be a cynical view, but is the modern approach of software engineering just a giant sales campaign ran by cloud providers to increase their profits?",
