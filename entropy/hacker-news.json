      "text": "Climate change and environmentalism has been on my mind a lot lately and it&#x27;s got me thinking ways to solutions to tackle it. One solution I thought of is why can&#x27;t the US government force the standardization of bottles and containers. Imagine if the government create a standard for two types of bottles and containers; one for consumables (drinks, etc) and the other for non-consumables (shampoo, liquid soap, etc). Within these two categories, there will be different sizes, 16oz, 28oz, etc. The only type of material that can be used is glass and aluminum. If the government mandate all companies do this, then companies who manufacture bottles and containers will compete on price since everything (design, sizes, material) else is standardized. Initially the cost of the bottles&#x2F;containers will be higher but overtime it should go lower as manufacturing companies compete on price and consumers start reusing existing bottles&#x2F;containers. With this mandate, now I can take my used shampoo bottle and refill it at the store (assuming stores offer this). Recycling would be easier as aluminum is profitable for recycling and glass can be washed and be reused. Government can mandate stores that sell things in these bottles&#x2F;containers to take them back. We can even have some form of CRV to encourage people to return&#x2F;recycle them. What kind of disadvantages are there to standardization of bottles and containers? Can the government realistically create such a mandate?",
