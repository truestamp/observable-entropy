      "text": "I already asked this a year ago but got no reply. The situation did not change. So I thought I try again.<p>The domain I would like to use for my startup redirects to a page on afternic.com and displays a page with a GoDaddy logo. Plus a form to request a price for the domain.\nI wonder if it is a good idea to fill out that form?<p>When I search for the domain on afternic.com they display a &quot;buy now&quot; price of $40k which seems very high to me. And there is a &quot;make an offer&quot; button with &quot;$25k min.&quot; next to it. Also very high.<p>There certainly are HN users with experience in buying domains. How would you go about it?",
