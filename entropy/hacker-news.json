It is complied, has a strong type system, very good standard library, good &amp; mature build systems, and excellent tooling with IDEs like IntelliJ.<p>However, I am not a fan to object oriented programming. I suppose I am looking for a C &#x2F; Python &#x2F; Haskell like language with the same ecosystem &#x2F; popularity as Java.<p>I tried Go, but it looks like Go is built to programmed on internet connected devices only. \nWith Java, dependencies can even be downloaded and put as Jars.",
