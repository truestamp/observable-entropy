Wikipedia has an article about it - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Personal_wiki<p>The Wikipedia article shows that a wiki that allows one to organize information similar to collaborative wikis except that a personal wiki is not collaborative.<p>I have been investigating the blogging, wiki, digital garden culture in the last few days to see what people who host their own websites do to organize their personal information.<p>I found some very good examples of digital gardens in this awesome Twitter thread - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Mappletons&#x2F;status&#x2F;1250532315459194880<p>The first example in that Twitter thread is this wiki&#x2F;garden - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomcritchlow.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F; - Garden, yes. But is this really a wiki? Can a simple tree of files be called a wiki?<p>I am trying to understand what is or isn&#x27;t wiki.
