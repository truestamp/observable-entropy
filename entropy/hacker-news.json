      "text": "I need some advice HN. I&#x27;ve been working on my hardware company for about 7 years (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geminicomplex.com). I developed a benchtop tester that can do functional verification of chips&#x2F;electronics. I designed all the hardware (main board, test board) and software (lib, driver, compiler, RTL cores, on-board website, simulation) myself, most of which I have recently open-sourced (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geminicomplex). I&#x27;ve had a few potential deals fall through and now I&#x27;m thinking real hard what to do next.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to raise money from YC (interviewed twice). I didn&#x27;t get in because I didn&#x27;t have a cofounder and they wanted me to talk to potential customers, which I&#x27;ve now done. I know that what I need to do is raise like $10m and hire people that can do sales, part procurement, manufacturing and more. I&#x27;m just finding it difficult to get myself to do that. I also have a hunch that most angels&#x2F;VCs wouldn&#x27;t invest in something like this because it doesn&#x27;t have the potential for quickly becoming a unicorn. I am understandably burned out. So I&#x27;m wondering what my options are in regards to selling&#x2F;liquidating the company including all its valuable IP and assets?<p>P.S. this board is way more than just a tester. You can write vector programs that execute with perfect cycle accuracy and nanosecond latency. You can also write test programs using the power of Lisp to coordinate the running of vector programs. Both of these things would work quite well for robotics if some parallelism and IPC was introduced at the hardware level.",
