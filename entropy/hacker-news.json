Its the same as when I started programming. What did change is that I do it much faster and with fewer mistakes.<p>I read Clean Code, Refactoring, DDD and others. My impression is they just provide patterns to apply in existing design&#x2F;code, they don&#x27;t provide guidance in creating the design in the first place.<p>I looked for online courses but none looks promising.<p>Did anyone experience the same issue and found helpful resources?",
