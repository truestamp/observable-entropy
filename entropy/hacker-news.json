      "text": "I have been learning about ECDH and that the Abelian-ness (specifically the difficulty of the discrete logarithmic problem) depends on the particular curve. The NSA story around Dual_EC_DRBG did not help.<p>Wikipedia: secp256k1 - &quot;\nIt&#x27;s constants were selected in a predictable way, which significantly reduces the possibility that the curve&#x27;s creator inserted any sort of backdoor into the curve.&quot;<p>So my question is what is the doomsday scenario? Wallets are set to hashes of Q (public key derived from P) so this should prevent anyone from having the Q of the ECDH to be able to back into the private key P? Is this accurate?",
