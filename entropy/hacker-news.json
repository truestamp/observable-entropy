While we do have a wiki of knowledge, a lot of the pages are outdated, incorrect or just not needed anymore.<p>My problem is, I know that we are missing information, what I don&#x27;t know is how to tease out that information from myself and other coworkers. Do you have any advice on how to get the knowledge out of my coworkers and into the knowledge base? Or, do you have a book you recommend? I have found a few books on knowledge bases but the reviews seem to be pretty hit and miss.",
