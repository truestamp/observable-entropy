      "text": "Hi Everyone, Prashant here from Devtron. With the community’s help and feedback, we built Hyperion - An Opensource tool to observe, deploy, manage &amp; debug Helm Application on Multiple Clusters. We developed Hyperion as a module that comes with Devtron preinstalled or it can be separately installed.<p>While there are pre-existing tools like  Kubernetes dashboard, Lens, Octant; Hyperion is focused on helm charts.<p>Some of the features which sets it apart are:\n- Deploy, manage, observe and Debug Helm charts across multiple clusters.\n    A. Install, Manage Helm charts, Applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters (hosted on multiple cloud&#x2F;on-prem) from a single Hyperion setup.<p>- Visualize resources deployed via helm charts contextually in a slick UI for easier monitoring and debugging.\n    A. Hyperion groups your Kubernetes objects deployed via Helm charts and display them in a slick UI, for easier monitoring or debugging. Access pod logs and resource manifests right from the Hyperion UI and even edit them!<p>- Centralized fine grained Access Management across multiple cluster.\n    A. Control and give customizable view-only, edit access to users at Project, Environment and Application levels<p>- View and Edit Kubernetes manifests, grep logs right from the Hyperion dashboard.\n    A. View and Edit all the Kubernetes resources right from the Hyperion dashboard<p>We have many more features planned for it in coming weeks.<p>Here are some more links that might be helpful:<p>Documentation:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.devtron.ai&#x2F;hyperion&#x2F;hyperion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.devtron.ai&#x2F;hyperion&#x2F;hyperion</a><p>Devtron Website: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devtron.ai&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devtron.ai&#x2F;</a><p>Please try it for yourself, hope it will be useful for you !! :-)",
