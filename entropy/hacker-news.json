This week it seems to be variations on &quot;paying open source developers&quot;.<p>Perhaps these can be marked as &quot;forums&quot; or &quot;themes&quot; and collected into a single post.<p>It is frustrating to watch the same idea posted every day, only to get swept away beyond post 500 or so. At best what we have now is that someone will add a comment that points to a prior post.<p>A simple (and therefore both controversial and wrong) solution would be to have a &quot;link-to&quot; button that forms a linked list (shades of lisp, eh Paul?).",
