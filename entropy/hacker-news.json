      "text": "I was reading PEP 517, and what came to mind is that I would love to read a history of Python tooling -- what has been attempted, what worked, what didn&#x27;t. There must be patterns there, and understanding them would make me a better engineer.<p>Of course, it doesn&#x27;t have to be Python. But Python would be a good case-study. Remember easy install? And before pip was a thing? distutils2? &quot;nose tests&quot;? So many things have been tried, so many tools come and gone, that there must be lessons there.<p>Does anything like that exist?",
