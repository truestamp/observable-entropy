      "text": "Hello!<p>Since I added the GPT-J and GPT-Neo endpoints to NLPCloud.io, I&#x27;ve had many questions about how to make the most of these 2 NLP models.\nSo I just wrote an article about few-shot learning with GPT-J and GPT-Neo: a simple technique to dramatically improve accuracy:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlpcloud.io&#x2F;effectively-using-gpt-j-gpt-neo-gpt-3-alternatives-few-shot-learning.html<p>Few-shot learning is about helping a machine learning model make predictions thanks to only a couple of examples. No need to train a new model here: models like GPT-J and GPT-Neo are so big that they can easily adapt to many contexts without being re-trained.<p>Thanks to this technique, I&#x27;m showing how you can easily perform things like sentiment analysis, code generation, tutorial generation, machine translation, spell correction, question answering, tweet creation...<p>I personally find it amazing what can be done with these models. It seems that only our imagination is the limit!<p>Hope you&#x27;ll find it useful.",
