      "text": "I am running a startup after years of waiting for the &#x27;best idea&#x27;.\nI realised, if I had started somewhere instead of waiting for &#x27;the one idea&#x27;, I would still have learned a lot and that would have been financially better too (by getting better jobs with that experience etc)\nSo, now I started this startup, which I know makes money, and I know I can run it. Problem is that, this business is not scalable. The reason I did this because I thought, &#x27;this will not retire me, but it will take me from A to B, ie make a million or two&#x27; (hopefully).\nI am very confused over past few months, that we haven&#x27;t made any progress in our startup due to not having any direction.\nI have another idea, that is scalable, but Uber like margins, not SAAS margins.\nI think answer to my problem would be straightforward to you, but I am too blinded.<p>How would you make a decision in this case?",
