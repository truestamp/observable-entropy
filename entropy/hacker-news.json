I thought that getting a service job wouldn&#x27;t be the best use of my time since I already know how to code. Is it very unlikely that someone will even give me the opportunity to demonstrate by programming abilities because I&#x27;m still in high school and don&#x27;t have any professional work experience? I&#x27;m confident in my skills, but I highly doubt that I&#x27;ll even get to show a potential employer them. I don&#x27;t really have any connections either, so I&#x27;m kind of out of options.",
