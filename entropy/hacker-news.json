Visualising the gradient using techniques such as guided backpop, gradCAM etc. and projecting its outputs&#x2F;features to vectors in R2 or R3 using TSNE&#x2F; PCA. \nI find model debugging by visualising along with Metrics Analysing helps me get more intuition into  what is going wrong!<p>What are the the most efficient tools, githubs etc. used by you for doing the same which helps \nyou get into crux of &quot;what is going wrong in your model?&quot;",
