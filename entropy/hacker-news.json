      "text": "I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about micro-startups lately, and one of the primary questions I am failing to understand is that how are entrepreneurs able to acquire customers for their product?<p>I am skeptical of the capabilities of the micro-saas culture, the only way it seems to work is if there already a customer base for the product and somehow you are able to capture the customer base by either shorting the competition or building tremendous value.<p>The customer base itself is developed through twitter and other social media channels. I don&#x27;t think these micro-startups have complexity or challenges that native startups inherently have (product-market fit)<p>Any good experts or resources that guide me through this turmoil? What I am expecting is a step by step guide that can help me generate let&#x27;s say $500 MRR?<p>I understand what I am requesting is difficult, however I am only looking for the way?",
