Because the amount of local news I read is just a small part of my news consumption.<p>How is the situation for other HN readers? How is it for the people in Russia? Can they access the whole internet? Can the majority read English?<p>I took a look at my web server stats and it turns out 2% of my visitors are from Russia. 30% of them are from Moscow and 10% from Saint Petersburg. I guess these are people who already have an overview of international news about the current situation? Or would it help to put some infos up?",
