I have found useful content on Python but I am missing some crucial pieces.<p>Like how do I run it in the context of my logged in browser (?)<p>I would like to do this as close a regular person browsing as possible to avoid FB taking offense.<p>c) I have tried some Macro plug ins for Firefox\nbut I cant get it to understand the recursive nature of threads.<p>Find the next thread is not hard, getting the first content is not hard,. but telling it to &quot;keep clicking&quot; all the way down is not something I have mastered yet.<p>d) I have tried doing it myself, little by little, copy and pasting, but it is soul crushing work and the body of content is huge.<p>I would prefer something I can run myself.\nI would prefer it to be slow. \nPresumably robot fast descent into every thread my wakeup FB bots?<p>I really wish FB would allow admins (with users voting for it) to download the content of their group to keep as a backup.<p>Are there any seasoned scrapers out there who can help me?",
