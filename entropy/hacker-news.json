It is about project and experimental data.<p>I&#x27;ve checked out NAS solutions with mirroring via RAID, but found too many reports of complete data loss (due to failing box, controller) online to consider them secure. Given all the media center apps they come with I&#x27;m also questioning whether I&#x27;m even in their target market. Also there is the theoretical problem of ransomware wiping the thing.<p>Is tape manageable for private use, and are there any go-to solutions?<p>What about cloud storage with too-big-to-fail companies (S3 buckets)? It sounds good to have access from everywhere without carrying some box around. It is not needed to keep the data private but I&#x27;d prefer it.",
