Not a whole lot for investments.<p>I did get lucky this year with GME but it turns out that trading is not for me so I lost most of it.\nNow even crypto is too mature so there&#x27;s not that much potential left (relatively speaking).\nDo I just need to continue grinding boring work for the next 10+ years to get back to previous highs or more, to finally stop doing &quot;useless&quot; work?",
