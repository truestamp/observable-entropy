      "text": "Hi HN, I’m Sarim and currently building Neat (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neat.run&#x2F;) - our goal is to provide the most simple user experience for web notifications on your desktop, starting with GitHub notifications.<p>We launched on Product Hunt today (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;neat-97cd97b9-a2ce-416a-9e2c-97508fa5f840).<p>Neat has been a work in progress for a couple of months now. We’ve built other products in the past (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neat.fyi&#x2F;), all in the data&#x2F;knowledge management space focusing on needs of the workplace. With our current product, we hope to improve the notification management workflow by allowing users to receive, process, and act on web notifications from one spot.<p>A bit about the team. We’re a group of non-software engineers and self-taught developers. We’ve come a long way in terms of the quality of the products we’d like to be building.<p>Neat, today, is far from perfect but my guess is that a lot of the folks here would appreciate something like this and we’d love to shape the product with your feedback. Happy to answer any questions in the comments below. Neat is free to download today.",
