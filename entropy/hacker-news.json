      "text": "Could this have the desired effect of reducing low-quality posts that the poster considers as such when posting? My habit is already only to post something that I personally want others to hear about, rather than &#x27;maybe this will get a vote&#x27;.<p>It could potentially reverse the problem of so many stories being posted that so many don&#x27;t even get to be seen and voted upon. It would also be great if some focus was brought back, tech is so much a part of everyday life that the intersection of tech and X is largely a general news feed.",
