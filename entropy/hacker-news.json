I have to ask, when in your career did you realize the importance of iterative development",

      "text": "To clarify, I know of 3 general ways of writing the latin alphabet; script, cursive, and calligraphy, which are as varied as the people who write them. I know of teaching scripts such as Getty-Dubay italics and historically popular scripts such as Spencerian which enforce a more standard style. In general, all of these scripts primarily focus on maintaining a resemblance to the base alphabet, but there is variation. Though plenty of letters such as X&#x27;s and O&#x27;s will have very little variation, others such as S&#x27;s and Z&#x27;s could be so different as to be unrecognizable by readers without exposure to the script. There is also enough variation in individual scripts that some writings, famously doctor&#x27;s notes, can be very difficult to understand. We all have some personal idea of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; handwriting which is often related to how well we are able to understand the script. Still, in most cases, there is enough resemblance to the base alphabet that regardless of who writes the characters, anyone with exposure to the corresponding alphabet can recognize them.<p>I am interested in knowing if anyone on HN uses or knows of any alternative scripts for the latin alphabet, in particular ones that sacrifice recognizability to the base alphabet for increased speed in handwriting. I am also curious of alternative scripts in other alphabets, but can personally only read and write the latin alphabet.",
