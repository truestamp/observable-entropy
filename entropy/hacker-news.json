      "text": "I&#x27;m a relatively pragmatic person, perhaps more so than some programmers. If I&#x27;m going to learn a new language, it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s something I want from it, not usually because I&#x27;m simply curious. Dart struck me as a particularly nice language - it&#x27;s statically typed which plays to my personal preferences and experience (background in C# mostly), it compiles both to JS for personal game-and-graphics-related projects, and to native x64 for practical work-related projects, and it has Flutter as a companion framework for UI.<p>That said, it seems like I rarely hear of projects being written in Dart, and the apparent lack of community-written packages concerns me. The only articles I find about it only speak its praises, or give criticisms that are too out-of-date to be valuable. Does anyone have thoughts to share on why I <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> learn Dart, or is it actually as nice as the articles I&#x27;m finding make it sound?",
