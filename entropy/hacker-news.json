      "text": "Hi, solo dev here. I often run into small coding problems where I’m stuck but something that is relatively simple but I’m simply not seeing the solution but I feel it would probably obvious to someone else, or at least solvable by someone more skilled than myself. Stack Overflow is not really helpful any more due to rejected questions or situations that are too specific for the site. Any suggestions on where I can turn to get some help? I’m happy to pay but would like a way to minimize turn around time and have pricing that is reflective of the size of the problem (often a single line fix and a total function size of just a dozen or two lines).<p>Basically it would be like walking over to the person that sits next to me and asking for some advice.",
