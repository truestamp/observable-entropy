      "text": "Before I started: yes, I have generalized anxiety disorder, properly diagnosed, properly treated. It has not bothered in me in years, and for someone who couldn&#x27;t get a haircut without feeling the heart racing to 150bpm, it&#x27;s been really great. All that therapy and (some, intermittent) medication worked, except for one use case: job interviews.<p>It&#x27;s not even a career-related anxiety: I manage large teams and am able to deal with all sorts of people at levels junior to EVP, no problem, very little is capable of throwing me off-balance.<p>Yet here I am. I have a Meta interview later tonight, and I feel lightheaded, sick, and weak-kneeled. I measured my temperature and I&#x27;ve got a minor fever. Couldn&#x27;t sleep at night. All psychological - I am not sick. Thinking about it, here are some of the things that cause all those reactions:<p>1) Fear of embarrassing myself in front of very senior&#x2F;accomplished people. \n2) Getting stuck&#x2F;blocked or coming up with a laughable solution that won&#x27;t make sense.\n3) Rejection fear and worse: fear of a downward spiral of failure that can end my career (typical catastrophic thinking).<p>Oddly enough, I don&#x27;t feel anything like that in behavioral interviews. It&#x27;s only in those where I need to be &quot;creative&quot;, like system design or coding. I am having a miserable weekend because of this. Frequently I think about cancelling interviews (and many times I do - this is the 3rd time I&#x27;m talking to Meta, the last 2 I cancelled the loops) because of this combination of anxiety and misery at peak level for so many hours and days.<p>People who have similar symptoms, how do&#x2F;did you deal with it?",
