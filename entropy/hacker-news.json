      "text": "Hi everyone! My name is Maxim Bartkov, I&#x27;m a co-author of Bucket4J library. I want to present the greatest library to provide rate-limiting in Java. Bucket4J - this is the most popular library to provide rate-limiting in Java. I invite each person to familiarize themselves with Bucket4J. We have been working for more than 7 years for the community and we want to make the library and open-source better. Bucket4J is used in many other libraries, such: Kubernetes client, JHipster, Atlassian, Twitch4J, and other popular libraries. Now we are going to huge release 7.0 with many features, we will publish about that a little bit later (in a few weeks).I hope on your support, we will be glad to your any contribution&#x2F;suggestions&#x2F;ideas - \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vladimir-bukhtoyarov&#x2F;bucket4j<p>Currently, our team trying to promote Bucket4J on the product hunt - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;bucket4j",
