      "text": "Does anyone know anything about ID.me? I had to do something with CA DMV and realized that now they mandate that my online DMV account shares my information with ID.me else it won&#x27;t let me proceed beyond the login screen.<p>Also, for new accounts, including minors, it is mandating this data sharing with ID.me, including SSN, DoB and so on.<p>This seems like a huge risk for me. Unfortunately it seems CA DMV has gotten rid of paper forms. Local DMV said they don&#x27;t have those anymore.<p>The only other option for me is to use the computer at the DMV, but that seems like its own risk as those are public terminals and I don&#x27;t feel comfortable filling private info, such as SSN, DoB, address on a public terminal.<p>Any thoughts&#x2F;info would help..",
