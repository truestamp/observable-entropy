      "text": "Hi HN (posting anonymously),<p>I&#x27;m seeking help on deleting a Facebook account created long whole ago with an email and phone that I no longer have access to. This account contains my personal details as well a lot of images, which now has become a concern for me.<p>I&#x27;ve tried going through FB recovery system but it says it&#x27;s not possible to recover without access to the email or phone number. I&#x27;ve deleted the email address long while ago, and no longer have access to the phone number. However, I can prove that account was mine because there is a lot of images of mine (all of them are taken even before I&#x27;m 18 yo). And, account hasn&#x27;t been active since 2015.<p>Has anyone been in a similar situation? Thanks for any help.",

      "text": "Hi HN. I&#x27;ve been an client of SendGrid for many many years, but they have since become impossible to work with. We have always fitted into their free tier, but now that we want to move up to a paying PLAN, they send us some nonsense email about compliance, and if we don&#x27;t reply with-in 72 hours. They will disable our account. Problem I have with this is:<p>1) What if I were someone now reachable for 72 hours or the mail got filtered to my SPAM box ? Bye Bye SLA and my clients<p>2) We did explain to them that we are a simply a enterprise ticketing system, for store maintenance. Think JIRA but for fast-food-stores like KFC (They actually one of our customers).<p>I am happy to pay a premium for a REAL Email-Sending Service, that DON&#x27;T send you emails over the weekend threatening you with account suspension.<p>Please note this &quot;threat&quot; was in response to us wanting to UPGRADE TO A PAYING PLAN, after years of using their free TIER. Same product, same emails we just want to send more and have better analytics.",
