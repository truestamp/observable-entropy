      "text": "A friend of mine was associated with a start up, which was later acquired by an MNC<p>By the time, the acquisition was complete, my friend had moved to another company in search of his career goals.<p>During casual meeting with a old colleague, my friend had overheard a conversation that his old colleague could be involved in data theft or competitive activity to his existing employer (MNC).<p>So my friend has disclosed the MNC’s CEO that some such activities could be happening in your firm. It was a responsible disclosure or a type of Whistle blowing.<p>After all these years, my friend had applied to the very same MNC and was qualified in the interview, but his offer rollout was rejected…<p>To his surprise, he contacted every possible lead. It turned out that, as his Whistle blowing did not result in any satisfactory findings. The MNC has decided to blacklist, the whistleblower(my friend) from recruitment.<p>Do you feel this is fair, for being honest Whistleblower? Who had asked to investigate? Do comment on the thread below.<p>My friend is a seasoned Product Manager with 10+ years of experience. If anyone wishes to contact my friend for a better offer he deserves write an email to ramsundhar20@gmail.com",
