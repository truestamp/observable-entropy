      "text": "I&#x27;m deploying a set of applications on top of Kubernetes like GitLab and Argo suite (Workflows, CD, Rollouts), Harbor, Prometheus, and more and I need to have an active-active solution distributed across two data centers for all (if possible) of these tools.<p>One approach I&#x27;m investigating having Kafka queueing the commits (and other requests) and one consumer on each data center writing the commit into GitLab to execute CI&#x2F;CD pipelines and deploy applications based on that commit. (CI&#x2F;CD will only execute once)<p>This way I don&#x27;t have to worry about replicating each application data from one data center to another and worry about where data is being written and so on.<p>I want to ask HN, are there best practices or documentation on how to do this kind of architecture that you can point me at?<p>Or is there a better way to work on this solution?",

We have to file replies to the USPTO on a timely manner.  Not being able to even get a sign of life from your IP attorneys simply isn&#x27;t acceptable.<p>What is going on?<p>I need a contact number or email for someone who will actually answer the fucking phone or email!
