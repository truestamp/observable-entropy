The idea came from the fact that there are tons of blog articles publishing lengthy articles for daily Wordle answers with a lot of unnecessary crap. This site just shows the answers without any of that. Suggestions ans feedback welcome!<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "Do you want the immersion of VR but still want to be aware of your surroundings?<p>VR systems allow remote collaboration, but the user is cut off from their real world environment and is not able to see their real world surroundings.  This is where Exanaview&#x27;s Immersive AR technology comes in.  With Exanaview AR, a portion of your real world is immersive, so you can still see and interact with the rest of your real world surroundings.  You can collaborate with remote peers during a design review of a large 1:1 scale model while still being able to see family members while working from home or see and talk to co-workers while working at the office.<p>Coming recently out of stealth, Exanaview&#x27;s patented immersive AR is the only AR technology on the market today that provides immersive multi peer collaboration while still allowing users to see their real world surroundings.  See a demo of the technology at the video link below and sign up for access at the website link below.<p>Exanaview&#x27;s new Immersive AR feature:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=h67Qx1b2uUE<p>Exanaview&#x27;s website:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.exanaview3d.com&#x2F;",
