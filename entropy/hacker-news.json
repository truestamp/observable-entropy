      "text": "Hi all, this might be naive or silly but I would greatly appreciate your experiences<p>Android dev of 9 years, past: agencies, freelance, research companies, joined FANG 6 months ago.<p>My product is filled with odd side effects, buggy and slow.\nIn my opinion the code is overly complex, classes &gt;2000 lines, doing so many thing with the 20+ class scoped booleans to check for edge cases. Weird architecture that one person holds.<p>Easy to break this, bad customise implementation that tries to take care of every possibility.  \nPeople make small changes to get impact and push code, I think this loses the bigger pictures and turns ugly quickly.<p>I&#x27;m (think) the only one that complains and is worried about this. Is it me or do other people experience the same at FANG?  \nI talked to the authors for a dialog, I think I stepped on toes. Communication was bad, but now has grinded to a halt, with no responses, diffs taking ages to review, no replies, just cc&#x27;s.<p>It all feels like patch work, these are all smart people. Some coworkers just say &quot;just go with it and do the same&quot;.<p>Is this the attitude of FANG? I&#x27;m legitimately thinking im a bad fit and leave.<p>How do I validate that I&#x27;m not the problem? Maybe it&#x27;s not overly complicated and I&#x27;m too stupid to realize it.<p>Anyone have any tips on how to talk to coworkers without stepping on toes regarding this code?<p>Sorry for chaotic questions.\nI just feel bad complaining, not being able to offer a solution and coworkers ignoring me.\nThanks a lot.<p>Edit: also talked to my managers, it&#x27;s being discussed higher up apparently.",
