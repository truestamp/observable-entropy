      "text": "My name is Mark Amberg, Co-founder of Craspa, restaurant tech. I was watching an interview with Mr.Beast speaking on the success of content creators and he mention that a lot of successful content creators have 1 thing in common which is collaboration. However, to my knowledge, there aren&#x27;t many places, for founders to group meet or find other founders that aren&#x27;t well established. This is why I want to start a founders group of around 8 founders in the B2B space to collaborate with and grow.<p>If you or know someone interested in weekly&#x2F;bi-weekly zoom group meetings, focusing on growth, accountability, bouncing ideas&#x2F;tactics, and overall growth together, please drop your company&#x27;s website and I&#x27;ll check it out and reach out to you.<p>Must be no funding to no more than series A funding and have a working and market-ready product.",
