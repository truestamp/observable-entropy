So much has been written about how to not-fix customers problems and have them walk away happy anyway.<p>It seems to have reached a breaking point, where a lot of companies and services simply has no capacity&#x2F;ability&#x2F;willingness to fix customer problems.<p>I speculate that economy of scale is somewhat to blame for this; After all, if you process hundreds of thousands of customers per day, it makes no difference if a a few edge-cases crashes and burns, it&#x27;s simply not a good investment to fix them, because, unless they are extraordinarily famous (and probably not even then), no amount of noise they can make will actually impact your profits.<p>It seems that aside from the most absolutely trivial of problems, companies and services are entirely unwilling to fix it, that is, if they even have a human being that can be reached in the first place.<p>Is anyone working on finding the causes for this degeneration and identifying what can be done to rectify it?<p>I&#x27;m starting to develop the opinion that some law should be in place to enforce a level of customer-service from any company that operates for-profit.. probably even have some goverment instance to which one can file complaints with companies to get them to help you.",
