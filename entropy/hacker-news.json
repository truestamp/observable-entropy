      "text": "Our team has a custom built CMS that is really painful to update. Every time we make the slightest change to the database we have to dig in and debug the thing, it&#x27;s too distracting. I&#x27;m looking for a web based Content Management System solution for everyone on my team, including the non-programming marketing and admin teammates. We need the bare-bones feature set:<p>1. Each user can login with a username and pass<p>2. User can see all the tables in the database<p>3. User can edit each column of each row<p>4. Basic searching&amp;filtering would be nice<p>It doesn&#x27;t need to be pretty, but it&#x27;s gotta be intuitive. Also I don&#x27;t want to have to configure anything, just the username and password for postgres and it works.<p>I&#x27;ve already explored pgAdmin and pgweb but they were both too technical. I&#x27;m also kinda new to the corporate world so google isn&#x27;t showing me ads for these kinds of things yet.<p>Thoughts?",
