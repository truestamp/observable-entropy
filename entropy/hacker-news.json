      "text": "I built a WhatsApp chat bot(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aibuddy.chat&#x2F;) that uses GPT-3 to hold a pretty decent conversation (Users have to bring their own OpenAI keys). It holds a memory of last 5 conversations currently.<p>Few planned improvements in near future.\n- Running this for WhatsApp is a bit expensive for both myself and the users), So the next plan is built this for telegram.\n- Let users choose different personas for the AI. \n- Let users choose how much conversation memory they want the bot to hold for them(more memory means more tokens means bigger bill from OpenAI)\n- Let users bring in their own data to fine-tune GPT-3 for a custom bot. For example, a bot trained on a writer&#x27;s work or even your own.<p>I can hook people up with some codes to try it out: just drop an email at aibuddy.chat@gmail.com",

      "text": "With smartphones becoming evermore accessible, they’ve become more versatile as well. GPS, flashlight, camera, pedometer, I could spend all day listing things it has replaced.<p>What about coding, not typing into a text editor, touch screen environments so users can piece together procedures, library calls etc.<p>It’s been attempted in the past and has failed. You could easily argue it’s nowhere near as productive. But maybe that’s because we still see things from the view of text based programming languages.<p>I’ve used the Alice IDE and Lego Mindstorm as a kid. I don’t know where touch based programming is now, but if I had to guess, it’s still very text centric in its fundamental design.",
