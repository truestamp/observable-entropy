      "text": "It looks like Google is considering a bespoke solution for the &#x27;G Suite legacy free edition&#x27; users for non-business use.<p>I found the following link in the Workspace help pages:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;answer&#x2F;60217#nonbiz&amp;zippy=%2Cwhat-if-i-use-g-suite-legacy-free-edition-for-personal-use-and-dont-want-to-upgrade-to-a-google-workspace-subscription<p>&gt; What if I use G Suite legacy free edition for personal use and don&#x27;t want to upgrade to a Google Workspace subscription?  \n&gt;   \n&gt; Upgrading to a Google Workspace subscription is a seamless transition for all customers currently on the G Suite legacy free edition.  \n&gt; However, we understand some customers may not use their G Suite legacy free edition for business and may be interested in other options.   \n&gt; If you have 10 or fewer users in your group and do not use your G Suite legacy free edition for business, please sign in to your administrator account to provide more information.  \n&gt;   \n&gt; &lt;Sign in to an administrator account (doesn&#x27;t end in gmail.com)&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Note that even if you decide you don&#x27;t want to upgrade to Google Workspace, you&#x27;ll still retain access to additional Google services and paid content purchased though non-Google Workspace services made with your legacy edition account (such as movies purchased on Google Play). Learn more above.<p>The &lt;sign-in&gt; link turns into a google form when logged in.\nI was able to fill it in and specify that I&#x27;m only interested in personal use.<p>----<p>From the same page - it also seems like they&#x27;ll provide a way to migrate to a non-Workspace account:<p>&gt; If I don’t want to upgrade to a paid subscription, can I transfer my data?\n&gt; \n&gt; In the coming months, we&#x27;ll provide an option for you to move your non-Google Workspace paid content and most of your data to a no-cost option. This new option won&#x27;t include premium features like custom email or multi-account management. \n&gt; You&#x27;ll be able to evaluate this option prior to July 1, 2022 and prior to account suspension. We&#x27;ll update this article with details in the coming months.",
