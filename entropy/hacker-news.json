      "text": "Hi HN.<p>Consider this to be a quick follow-up to my recent post complaining about Unity&#x27;s UI system. The new UI element system finally allows defining your UI using XML with various CSS like attributes.<p>This is the best thing to happen to Unity in years, I went ahead and refactored my entire UX using it and I just can&#x27;t be happier. The only real downside is this is very much for programmers only. You can&#x27;t drag and drop events onto a UI element as you could with the previous UI system.<p>I&#x27;m still just getting started, I have an applied any themes to the UI yet, but this had made my life so much easier. It addresses one of Unity&#x27;s biggest weaknesses, and while it&#x27;s not perfect, the documentation is very sparse, it&#x27;s pretty great.<p>While there is a very neat UI builder, you can also edit the XML directly, which I appreciate. You don&#x27;t even need to use Unity to design your UI, assuming you&#x27;re already comfortable with CSS.",
