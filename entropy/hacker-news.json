      "text": "Hey, I’m Taylor, founder of Gymscript (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getgymscript.com). Gymscript is a mobile app that guides you through a complete strength training program. &quot;Complete&quot; means that your program shows you what strength exercises to do AND the proper warm-up&#x2F;activation movements and necessary post exercise stretches. It keeps you flexible and reduces chance or injury as you get stronger.<p>After getting my master’s degree in exercise physiology, I started my fitness consulting business in San Francisco. I built Gymscript because I have seen many professionals in Silicon Valley suffer from forward head posture, back pain, shoulder pain, neck stiffness all due to sitting at a computer for too long. These issues can inhibit your ability to exercise and get strong without pain or injury.<p>A common misconception is that you can fix these problems simply by adjusting HOW you sit. While this can help for some, a better solution is to counter the negative effects of sitting by strengthening certain muscles and stretching the tight ones (and try to sit a little less thought the day).<p>This product was made for busy professionals that are interested in strength training but want to improve or avoid injury, postural issues, and muscle tightness.<p>You can try out the app without actually signing up or inputting your email. Just download and go!<p>After trying the app you can sign up for an additional 7 day free trial ($4.99 a month after trial)<p>Also, you can contact me for questions or feedback about the app or general posture&#x2F;exercise concerns! We can even schedule a video chat or call to discuss further\n info@geygymscript.com<p>I watch this email like a hawk so don’t hesitate to reach out!<p>Hope this helps!",
