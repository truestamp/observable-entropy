There are plenty of tutorials to learn how to program but I&#x27;ve struggled to find good tutorials that teach effective ways to debug software in a Linux system.<p>For example - If I&#x27;m trying to help debug the bring-up of a new LCD display (as part of an embedded Linux system) the issue could be in the MIPI DSI driver, the Display driver, the GPU driver, gstreamer, etc...<p>Is there a &quot;best practices&quot; for systematically attacking Linux system issues?",

      "text": "After seeing this post [1], and old question came to mind and I finally decided to ask it: how do you protect your source code?<p>I like to write my games in JavaScript cause I like the language and it easy to &quot;embedded&quot; it into native apps. In case of Android, I can just write a JS Interface and access anything I need on the device (database, notifications...); and doing this way I have not only a web app game, but a game that with some effort could pass as native in other platforms.<p>So, I&#x27;ve been writing this game [2][3] and I want people to play it, so I can get some feedback, but if I release a browser version what would stop people from just copying the source code? Let&#x27;s be honest, there&#x27;s no secret algorithm or optimization in my code that is worth protecting, but its hard work. I know there&#x27;s no REAL way of protecting source code, like we just saw with the source code post [1], but how would you go about protecting the code on shipping the game? Both in Android and Electron apps, the JavaScript code just sits there, anyone with a file extractor could navigate the folders and find the code.<p>Is that it? After I ship my game people with enough resource could just &quot;own&quot; the code? Should I just accept this and move on? Would you release alpha version of a project (web app in this case) knowing that if people just right click they can get the code?<p>1 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30346414\n2 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=x--liapcOMw\n3 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;HoboHeroTheGame",
