      "text": "Netlify has been great so far, but I think we&#x27;re outgrowing it. We&#x27;re getting several hundred users per day to our SPA and need more advanced features like logging so we can better identify issues arising on the frontend. Logging is only available on the enterprise plan, and we just don&#x27;t see the value in spending that much just to add a feature like logging.<p>What are some good alternatives to Netlify? Our backend is hosted on GCP, and I wouldn&#x27;t be apposed to moving it over there, but I do like the simplicity of Netlify + deploy previews on PRs.<p>Suggestions appreciated.",
