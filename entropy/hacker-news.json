      "text": "Noon here. Hi. My super basic understanding re email this:<p>- email lives on a server\n- Gmail is the user interface for engaging with your emails\n- when you delete an email, you remove it from the UI&#x2F;Gmail platform, but not from the server<p>Am I thinking of this correctly? Is a platform like Gmail more of a way to curate your experience of what is permanently &#x2F;semipermanently(?) kept on the server?",
