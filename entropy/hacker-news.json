      "text": "I recently left Apples ecosystem and switched over to Arch Linux, Migadu for E-Mail, rsync.net for backups and my own server for CardDav, CalDav and media streaming. I also switched from Apple Music to Bandcamp and enjoy listening to Indie bands througu FLAC files.<p>My setup is actually now much easier and faster to use. It took me 1 month of setting everything up, but I love it.<p>My only &quot;problem&quot; is now my mobile device. I still have an iPhone X but would like to replicate the same &quot;ownership&quot; feeling I have on the desktop.<p>I was giing through Android phones which are:<p>* rootable\n* have a SD card\n* have a headphone jack<p>The only phone I found was the Sony Experia 1 iii. Bow I wonder what other geeks are using?",

Something similar to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dxdao.eth.link where members can vote to bring on new members and potentially offer to cover living (UBI) and business expenses for a year at a time with an option to re up if there&#x27;s traction.<p>I&#x27;m personally not a fan of crypto but DAOs seem like an interesting business structure that could make it possible to set things up in a decentralized manner and make it easier to manage members vesting in and out if they leave.<p>Starting this would either require a few initial crowdfunded projects or a merger of already profitable bootstrapped companies willing to use some of their revenue to fund things (ideally new projects that they&#x27;d be customers of).<p>TLDR: How can we build the Y Combinator for Indie Hackers without needing VCs and infinite growth?<p>(also posted on IH: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;would-you-join-an-indie-hacker-dao-cooperative-if-so-how-should-it-be-structured-864503bd13)",
