No censorship (except for laws enforced in hosting country).<p>To make it possible, it&#x27;d have to be a MVP - just basic twitter functionality with all posts stored in memory and accessible for only a few days. Just basic, high-performance, low-latency microblogging with an extendable API. Everything else would be outsourced to the community: search, direct messaging, analytics, advanced functionality, etc.<p>It would be like a centralized mastadon, but with a b-corporate type structure.",
