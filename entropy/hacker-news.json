If so, please comment<p>I used to be in the scene in 2016-17 (early years of raidforums) I made a few RAT&#x27;s disguised as cheat software (luckily I came to my senses and stopped making malware), i&#x27;ve checked &quot;breached.to&quot; (its successor) however im having trouble finding actual hackers.<p>I am aware of forums like breached.to, nulled.to, cracked.io, v3rmill, blackhatworld, if someone knows of good threads&#x2F; sub-forums on those sites please comment",
