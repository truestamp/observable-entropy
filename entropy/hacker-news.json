      "text": "I haven’t coded in a long time and want to hire someone to write a program for me. I just don’t have the time or inclination to do it myself. I’m not really sure where to go or how to look around for something like this, so any advice would be appreciated. One of my main concerns is making sure there aren’t any legal shenanigans wrt payment or copyright (I just want it GPL’d anyway).<p>The basic idea is to have a program that I can pipe plain text into and get Orthic shorthand rendered as PDF or similar as output, so I can take books from Gutenberg or wikisource and produce reading practice. I don’t <i>think</i> it would take a whole lot of work, seems like an experienced dev could do it in a week or so with python and a curve drawing import. The shorthand system is alphabetic, not sound-based, which simplifies things pretty drastically.<p>How much would you think something like this would run? Any other advice I should have? I’m not hiring tomorrow or anything, just toying with the idea.",
