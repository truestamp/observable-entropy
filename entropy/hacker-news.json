Sun&#x27;s energy across life time of solar system has fueled life on this planet by promoting growth of bottom of the food chain. Over the past 4.571 bn years, the Sun has produced X joules of energy. Of this 0.04696% has reached the earth. Of this 70% hits the earth&#x27;s surface. 66% warms the sea and 33% hits the land. Assuming 30% of land is flora then Sun has delivered 1.80E+40 Joules of Energy to forests and 1.20E+41 Joules to the ocean. etc , etc With some extra assumptions could work out how much of the Sun&#x27;s energy remains stored in the planet in the form or oil and coal.
