      "text": "I&#x27;m in my late twenties working in a European high cost of living (HCOL) city, and I&#x27;m considering a move to a medium cost of living (MCOL) city because I have a slight suspicion that I&#x27;d be happier there. I&#x27;m struggling to weigh off the potential increase in life satisfaction against the guaranteed decrease in compensation.<p>The reason for my suspicion that I&#x27;d be happier in the MCOL city is that I really liked the vibe in the city on the multiple occasions I visited it, and the fact that I have friends there who enjoy living there. In the HCOL city I&#x27;m living in, on the other hand, I don&#x27;t have any good friends, and I&#x27;m not too enthusiastic about the vibe here either. However, the salary is great.<p>The company I&#x27;m working at would agree to a remote work arrangement in the MCOL city. However, the guaranteed decrease in compensation would result in a ~50% decrease in annual net savings post expenses. I don&#x27;t particularly care about money at this stage of my life, but obviously higher savings allow for an earlier retirement and&#x2F;or transition to a fulfilling low-paying job. There&#x27;s also a possibility that being remote would negatively affect my career progression.<p>The obvious problem I&#x27;m facing is that the only quantifiable variable in this equation is the sum of annual net savings. I have no idea if I&#x27;d actually be happier in the MCOL city, and if so, by how much. It would be a real shame to move to the MCOL city only to find out that I don&#x27;t really like living in that city as much as visiting it. That would be a very costly lesson. On the other hand, if I knew for a fact that I&#x27;d be a lot happier in the MCOL city, I think that would be worth the diff in savings to me.<p>That situation doesn&#x27;t seem unique. It applies similarly to deciding between jobs with differences in compensation and suspected job satisfaction. I&#x27;m wondering, do any of you have experiences in approaching a problem like that? Do you just go with your gut?",
