So far the only examples I&#x27;ve found are the typical home server stuff:<p>- plex&#x2F;media server<p>- remote backup<p>- file sharing&#x2F;sync<p>But I&#x27;m more interested in scriptable use cases that can&#x27;t be covered by a Linux server, e.g.:<p>- Xcode builds<p>- headless browser service (puppeteer) for website screenshots (for apple emoji &amp; font rendering)<p>- automated screenshots&#x2F;screencasts (via screencapture &amp; apple script)<p>- iCloud file organization (e.g. with Hazel.app)<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many more possibilities, so... if you have a macOS server, what do you use it for?",
