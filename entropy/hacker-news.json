      "text": "I admit I don&#x27;t have full idea how can govt continue working with ever deepening debt, not an economist. But the govt increases debt limit each time, what&#x27;s the point of having a debt limit then?... whether govt spends money through budget or create money and distribute it through cheap loans, it&#x27;s the same, isn&#x27;t it?... more money supply in the system. i.e. instead of passing a budget that gives small business owners 10k in aid vs allowing small biz to borrow 10k at 1% rate for 30 year payback.. more or less the same thing, in first case budget was already in negative, just became more negative..but so what?<p>there has been ongoing discussion on taxing income vs wealth, taxing billionares, UBI, etc....<p>taxing wealth over income only makes sense if income taxes go down.. but even if they go down what&#x27;s the point.. at this point why does govt even bother collecting taxes obviously doesn&#x27;t care about how much debt it runs<p>somehow if govt decided to tax everyone 80%, and balance the budget, in few cycles even that budget will be not enough.<p>I am really confused about what are implications for govt to perpetually keep going in deeper debt, what would happen if govt just stopped taxing everything and just kept going in debt even faster?",
