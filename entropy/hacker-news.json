      "text": "If you are planning on building a Connector App on Shopify, you should know you must have the company you are connecting Shopify with also agree to Shopify’s API terms and conditions.<p>For example, if you are building an app to connect Shopify to Google Merchant, you will need to get Google to agree to Shopify’s API terms (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shopify.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;api-terms). As you can imagine, this is next to impossible.<p>Surprisingly, Connector Apps already approved and in the Shopify store have not yet had to abide by this requirements (only new submissions). We recently had ours rejected for this reason, so just want to give everyone a heads-up.<p>Unfortunately, it is becoming ever more difficult to develop for the Shopify App Store.",
