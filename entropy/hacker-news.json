      "text": "Hey HN! I work on a database for my day-job and I realized I had never written one from scratch, so I wrote bugfruit! Once I was mostly satisfied with it, I looked up some benchmarks to compare my simple database to other brand name key-value stores. I was surprised to see that mine held up fairly well on the subset of benchmarks I replicated. So I used the Pavlo Database Naming System [0] to name it and open-sourced the code. I&#x27;d love to hear any feedback you might have on it!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~pavlo&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;on-naming-a-database-management-system.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;~pavlo&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;on-naming-a-datab...</a>",

I would want it to systematically capture 5 minutes or so, then start the next capture automatically.<p>If there&#x27;s not an easier way to do this, then maybe I can look into making a plug-in. But I&#x27;m really hoping there&#x27;s some other way. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",
