      "text": "&quot;To help keep your account secure, starting May 30, 2022,   Google will no longer support the use of third-party apps or devices which ask you to sign in to your Google Account using only your username and password.&quot;<p>What does it have to do with phone numbers, you might think? Well, it&#x27;s not that obvious.<p>I have beed using FairEmail app to read emails on my phone for many years. Recently, Google made this change, so I thought I need to take some actions to make sure I can continue using my favourite email app. After reading a bit, everything looked pretty simple:<p>- I could add my email account to my phone and login using google&#x27;s native authentication methods, or<p>- «you can use an app password, please see below.»<p>Sure I don&#x27;t want to add google&#x27;s account to my phone just to be able to receive emails via IMAP, so I&#x27;ll just generate separate app password for my email app, right?<p>Well, for some reason it&#x27;s not possible to generate app passwords unless you have 2FA enabled. The option is just not there.<p>What can be simpler than adding 2FA to my account? I use password managers and my passwords are super strong, but I have no other choice, I&#x27;ll have to use an authenticator app to continue reading emails on my phone, doesn&#x27;t make much sense but anyway…<p>You can&#x27;t just scan a QR with TOTP secret and enable 2FA for your account. Well, you can, after you enable 2FA by SMS using your phone number, or 2FA by notification on the phone, after you add google account to your phone. But using an authenticator is an «additional method» which is not available until «primary» 2FA method (SMS &#x2F; phone number) is added. Oh, you can give away your phone number first, enable 2FA, after 2FA is already enabled you can remove 2FA by SMS and keep using authenticator app as your 2FA method, it&#x27;s simple.<p>I guess I&#x27;ll just have to stop using google. Thanks for making my life more difficult and caring about my security, Google.<p>TL:DR; You can&#x27;t use «less secure» apps (apps other than official gmail app) to sync emails if you don&#x27;t want to link your account to your phone number or add google account to your phone.",

      "text": "I graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s of engineering in a top public school. I learned software in my first job, where for a few years I did enterprise Java, some basic SQL and basic frontend. It was definitely a large code base, just no fancy technology behind it. After that, I struggled to find a job and out of desperation accepted an application configuration developer position. Essentially, I work in the services side of the company, doing simple coding and configuration of the product for separate clients. I have always been very aware how this is a step back (even worse considering I didn&#x27;t start very far ahead to begin with).<p>But every time I attempt to apply to jobs, I can&#x27;t get them. I feel like I&#x27;m stuck. I feel most employers on the Who&#x27;s Hiring thread (or anywhere else) probably look at my resume and not see me aligning anywhere close to their requirements. Which I would probably agree to. But at this point I&#x27;m also somewhere close to 10 years into my career, so I&#x27;m definitely not a junior. I feel like the only jobs I will be able to get are similar to what I&#x27;ve had: basic web developer, not tackling any interesting problems, little potential for growth, and if I&#x27;m lucky maybe using some modern technology.<p>I really just want a job that is willing to accept that I don&#x27;t have their requirements, but them being okay to letting me pick it up on the job. More than anything, I want to grow my career. I want to work somewhere challenging, where I can problem solve and learn. I am not a bad software developer. If anything, I&#x27;m quick to learn and will always end up being the subject matter expert of what I&#x27;m working on. I like computer science, which is why I&#x27;m also currently enrolled in a computer science masters. I know I&#x27;m not dumb. I just don&#x27;t know how to prove my worth to companies when applying.<p>Any advice will be very appreciated",
