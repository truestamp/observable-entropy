      "text": "Hi All, I am creating a free slack app that is going to help remote teams. It allows teams to easily run agile processes such as story&#x2F;task estimations. My goal is to get it to 10k users a month.<p>Why am I writing here?<p>one word, accountability. I like to write down my journey so others can see it and I feel accountable this way. I am a solo developer so It is hard to keep going without any external feedback<p>What&#x27;s in it for you?<p>I will mostly share my learnings so if it helps you, great, if not, I hope you don&#x27;t mind.<p>What did I learn lately?<p>I have been trying to decide between cloud services like AWS or GCP vs self-managed hosting. Cloud services have come up a long way and offer a generous free tier. I will share a simple setup with GCP cloud functions and firebase hosting to host your project for a few pennies and almost zero ongoing maintenance.<p>Slack has a really nice dev setup that allows webhook-based interaction and API-based interaction. Webhook is a simple URL that processes HTTP requests. I will probably use the webhook approach for now.<p>I found that it is hard to get good domain names. I tried looking at expired domains websites and found some good .com domains that are cheap so don&#x27;t rule out the expired domain method for your next project.<p>that&#x27;s all for now, thanks for reading, will post some more tips next time",
