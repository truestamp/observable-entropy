We get a lot of insight into the internal dynamics of companies like Theranos where the failure of the core technology wasn&#x27;t accepted by the leadership. I haven&#x27;t heard much from the inside about examples of failed startups that went down quietly (ex: TransAtomic power[0]).<p>[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;240126&#x2F;nuclear-startup-to-fold-after-failing-to-deliver-reactor-that-ran-on-spent-fuel&#x2F;",
