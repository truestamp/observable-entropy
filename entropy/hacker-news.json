I am now a below-average performer at an elite company but making 99th percentile wages.<p>Anyway... the punchline is that my daughter has always been gifted emotionally (whereas I&#x27;m always morose, irrespective of circumstance) but due to some difficulties in preschool, underwent some tests and has an IQ of 102.<p>Any other parents gone through something similar? This is as much of an emotional matter as anything else, but would love to hear anything anecdotal. Something comforting I found on Wikipedia: &quot;IQ goes from being weakly correlated with genetics for children, to being strongly correlated with genetics for late teens and adults.&quot;",
