      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m Robbert, after 1,5 years of hard work I have just released DataGridXL version 2.<p>DataGridXL is the world&#x27;s fastest Excel-like Data Grid. It&#x27;s written in JavaScript ES6 and made in the 2020s. It weighs less than 250kb and it has zero dependencies.<p>My goal for DataGridXL is to be the most performant, reliable and user-friendly spreadsheet-like data table. It has its own virtual DOM to keep scrolling &amp; editing fast and to prevent DOM errors.<p>New features since version 1:<p>- Multi-Range Selection<p>- Freeze and Unfreeze rows &amp; columns<p>- Hide and Show rows &amp; columns<p>- Rapidly search cells<p>- Fullscreen Mode<p>- Works with Touch (new bottom bar enables editing data on touch devices)<p>- Dark Theme<p>- Quick Column Sorting<p>Please have a look at the homepage <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;</a> and star DataGridXL2 on Github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DataGridXL&#x2F;DataGridXL2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DataGridXL&#x2F;DataGridXL2</a>.",
