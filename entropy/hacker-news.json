      "text": "A bunch of developers and myself have created RepliByte - an open-source tool to seed a development database from a production database.<p>Features:<p><pre><code>  - Support data backup and restore for PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB\n  - Replace sensitive data with fake data\n  - Works on large database (&gt; 10GB) (read Design)\n  - Database Subsetting: Scale down a production database to a more reasonable size\n  - Start a local database with the prod data in a single command\n  - On-the-fly data (de)compression (Zlib)\n  - On-the-fly data de&#x2F;encryption (AES-256)\n  - Fully stateless (no server, no daemon) and lightweight binary\n  - Use custom transformers\n</code></pre>\nMy motivation:<p>As a developer, creating a fake dataset for running tests is tedious. Plus, it does not reflect the real-world data and painful to keep updated. If you prefer to run your app tests with production data. Then RepliByte is for you as well.<p>Available for MacOSX, Linux and Windows.<p>&gt; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;qovery&#x2F;replibyte",
