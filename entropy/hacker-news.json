      "text": "Hi HN!<p>Over the past year, we’ve been building Wealthly (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wealthly.com), a tool to help you aggregate all your investments, and a community of investors who are sharing their portfolios and knowledge.<p>I started working on this idea because I had two personal frustrations:<p>I had a few different brokerage accounts, some retirement accounts, and a little crypto all in different places. It was hard to get a glance of everything I had. I tried all the products in the market, and they all had various issues (poor data quality, constant disconnect, didn’t support options, etc)<p>I learned a great deal about investing from other people online, but I always wanted to see where people actually put their money. I needed the transparency because it gave me a sense of comfort and trust<p>We’ve slowly built up a small group of users who have connected close to $18M of live assets. We’re hoping that the HN community will find a tool and a community like this useful!<p>I think whenever a product like this shows up, the number one thing people get most concerned with is always security and are you scraping brokerages for data. Unfortunately we don’t have a magic bullet around this issue in the US. We use the brokerages’ official OAuth APIs whenever we can, and resort to scraping when we’re forced to with no other solutions.<p>To address the security and privacy concerns people have, we are also thinking about open sourcing our connectors, and creating a desktop app where all your data is stored locally instead of in the cloud.<p>We haven’t opened up sign ups yet, but you can join with this invite link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;join.wealth.ly&#x2F;4WFYJ3.<p>Would love to hear any feedback!<p>This is my personal portfolio: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wealth.ly&#x2F;@sunny",
