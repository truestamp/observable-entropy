The only required fields are the type of chart and a list of data points to chart.<p>There are many ways to create charts, but I&#x27;ve found most charting solutions only work inside the application they are created in. I was looking for a solution that allows me to use&#x2F;create&#x2F;share charts however I want easily.<p>In the future I really want to focus on being able to simply integrate with other service like notion.<p>There&#x27;s a free plan that allows you to make 100 requests per day.<p>Hope you&#x27;ll find it useful. Let me know if you have any comments or features for me to add next.",
