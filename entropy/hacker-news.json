That is, reduce data science reliance on data engineers in mature data organizations.<p>While living between both worlds of software engineering and data science, we have seen a lack of mature organizational tooling for data scientists. Data teams either require embedded data engineers or companies are forced to find a unicorn full-stack data software engineer to hire. On top of that, the tooling that does exist in this space does not take into consideration good software and infrastructure practices that most high performance software engineering teams require.<p>We are looking for interested teams to join our beta! Please check out or website and sign up",

I was looking into a sort of USB-C switch, possibly, but they seem very uncommon.<p>I rarely have more than two on at any time, and a 5 port KVM seems like overkill (If they even exist). Is there a &quot;one button switch&quot; solution to this?",
