I hope this is unlikely but given the power they wield it also is &quot;possible&quot;.<p>My main questions are:<p>What happens to the dollar as a reserve currency? How quick if there are changes would you anticipate those being made?<p>How does this impact the American and global economy the next month &#x2F; year from your POV?",
