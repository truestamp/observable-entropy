I hoped that deja-dup would allow me to restore from the live CD, but found out that I need the same computer name and username, so I had to reinstall everything before being able to restore.<p>This seems inconvenient, and I don&#x27;t understand why it is the default behavior.<p>What are you using to do your backups ? Have you felt the same frustration I&#x27;m facing ?",
