      "text": "Hi HN,<p>Like many of you I want to be able to enjoy my evenings after work by either reading books, spending time with friends, learning something new, working on side projects, workout, or running errands. However, I&#x27;m typically way too tired to get myself off the couch on most days to do anything and unfortunately I cannot take a nap or sleep to recharge. I&#x27;m only able to consume easy to digest content in this state. This was both the case with WFH or going to the office.<p>The other day I took a shower after I got back home and it was extremely recharging. I&#x27;ve been forcing myself to walk into the office which gives me a separation between work and home and also forces me to walk 30 mins to and from the office which is a great daily exercise.<p>What have worked for you that allows you to recharge after a day of work so you can use the evening for the activities you like to do?",
