      "text": "I have been working at a FAANG company on a team that has a pretty interesting product. I feel that most of my time, however, is sucked up doing things that no longer about coding or building a successful product. Every new feature we want to release takes so much time, and I&#x27;m starting to feel like I have limited impact on the overall outlook of the product. The unfulfilled-ness is starting to get to me and I am losing ideas for a creative outlet. I have tried coding in my free-time, but have just run out of projects that interest me. Sorry about the complaining, but I am reaching out to see if anyone else has been in a similar rut and has suggestions for getting out of it.",
