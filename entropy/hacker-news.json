      "text": "I saw this video from economics explained today: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kVOTPAxrrP4<p>Which talks about how an MIT computer model from 1972 ‘predicted’ a collapse of our growth based global economy. And how it appears we’re on track to meet that prediction.<p>So it has me thinking: Yes clearly political and social change are needed more than anything. But engineers like me don’t control governments.<p>So what is there that a person can work on which is most likely to have to greatest positive impact on helping the world get past the coming energy, climate and population crises?<p>At the moment I’m working on a robotics project which it is hoped will make fully autonomous mining and manufacturing closer to reality.",
