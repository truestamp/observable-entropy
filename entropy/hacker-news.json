What I enjoyed about textbooks at that level was a lot of basic (but scientific) knowledge about a lot of subjects, which I could then explore more deeply if I liked. Encyclopaedias were also nice for this, but the science textbooks really were my favorite.<p>The closest thing I’ve found is YouTube channels, but great ones aren’t necessarily super common, and I don’t know if any with a wide scope. Wikipedia I often find the articles are too complex when you get into specific topics.<p>The purpose is just for fun and intellectual stimulation, so not really looking for educational programs. Does anyone have any recommendations?",
