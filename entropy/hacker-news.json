      "text": "On windows I can still use KeyNote NF for editing notes, but there has never been replacement. Even cherrytree is only for a single xml tree. I used Jreepad until it became to difficult with modern macOS, but it has the same single xml tree issue. Is there anything out there I have overlooked for macOS? If possible I&#x27;d like to use it on linux as well and then I can sync between my mac mini and desktop linux.",
