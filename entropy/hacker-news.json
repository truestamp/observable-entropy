      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using TypeScript for a few years. Every team I used TypeScript with, it massively improved productivity for everyone, for reasons that are well known.<p>But in other companies and teams I&#x27;ve been at, most of the developers have some prejudice around TypeScript and think it&#x27;s annoying extra fluff that takes time, or that it&#x27;s worthless because it doesn&#x27;t do any dynamic type checking. They often don&#x27;t want to try using it<p>What are some good ways you&#x27;ve managed to evangelise TypeScript? Any good resources&#x2F;talks or study cases that can help people get over it?",
