Till date, Quickbooks have refused to release the money to me, because they they claim they cannot verify my Merchant account.<p>On further research, it seems I don&#x27;t qualify for a merchant account since I am outside the US. But if they cannot provide me a merchant account, at least they should send back the payment to my client, so that I can receive it another way.<p>But they have terminated my account, are refusing to talk to me, and have also refused to send the money back to my client.<p>At this point I would like to know if there&#x27;s a way to contact a higher-up at QuickBooks, or I have to file a claim in small claim court to recover my money.",
