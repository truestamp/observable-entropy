      "text": "Like many here I have ${dayjob}, side hustle, trying to learn new things, do life, and everything else.<p>After doing software for a long time, I&#x27;m finding that while I enjoy the technical challenge, learning _everything_ required to do it all isn&#x27;t as fun as it used to be.<p>So particularly in the side hustles, I often come across something where I&#x27;ve got &quot;good-enough-for-now&quot; solution, knowing very well I&#x27;m incurring technical debt. At the same time I also knowing that there any number of people out there that have solved that exactly problem, encountered all the hard to learn lessons, and could replace my good-enough solution for an excellent one in the fraction of the time, but I don&#x27;t have a team to turn to to help.<p>Where would you recommend I turn to to hire someone to solve small and specific problems?<p>Yes, I could ask on stack overflow or another forum, but I want to pay someone for their time to come and implement the solution.<p>Should I just put small projects on some freelancing sites? If yes, which ones? If not, where else could I look?<p>Here are a handful of some concrete examples I&#x27;ve come across in the last 6 months:<p>* finishing off a hacked together CI flow for a django app for minimal downtime\n* Evaluating and finding the right html&#x2F;js component to allow thousands separators in a text field\n* Fine tuning twilio video performance and multiple streams\n* Setting up a good developer workflow for doing nicer form layouts in django",
