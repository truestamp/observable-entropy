      "text": "I&#x27;m currently working as a frontend engineer for a small agency (mostly using React and TypeScript). As much as I like the place, I want to grow my career towards backend, which is something they don&#x27;t do.<p>For this reason, I want to learn backend in off-working hours. I&#x27;m willing to dive deeper into algorithms, data structures and maybe choose between Python and Go.<p>I read a similar question asked in another online community, but the response OP got was to &quot;find a company willing to train them&quot;. I want to teach myself enough to be able to apply for backend jobs, and not to find a company willing to bet that I can learn backend on the job. Not only is my local market competitive (I&#x27;m junior) but it also lacks opportunities.<p>Are there books to read, blogs to follow, resources to digest, that will help me grow up to an acceptable level to be considered for a backend engineer position? They don&#x27;t even have to be directly relevant with a specific stack or anything. For example, a recommendation I got from someone was to read &quot;Designing Data-Intensive Applications&quot;.<p>You can also assume that I know how to Google, it&#x27;s cleaning up the noise in the results which is time consuming and prone to errors, given that I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know.",
