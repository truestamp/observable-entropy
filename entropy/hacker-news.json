      "text": "Hi! As a big fan of SQLite, I always found the tooling to explore remote databases a bit lacking. Current solutions involve running an extra service in the remote host and exposing a port to access it. I built a small web app that can explore remote SQLite databases without having to run any service on the remote, you just need SSH.<p>It works by sending sqlite3 CLI commands over a multiplexed SSH connection. The commands use the &quot;-json&quot; flag from the sqlite3 CLI. This basically turns the SSH connection into an JSON API for the remote SQLite database. The project is hosted on GitHub[0] and I wrote a blog post with more details about the project and how it works[1].<p>I&#x27;m still exploring multiple ideas and implementations details, but feedback is more than welcome.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ricardoanderegg.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;sqlite-remote-explorer-gui&#x2F;<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;litements&#x2F;litexplore",
