      "text": "I was just browsing and noticed an add for a Staff Engineer Position at Reddit focusing on crypto and this was in the job description:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nThe Internet is the most important public square in history. It shapes economies and elections, relationships and futures. Yet it is controlled by a handful of powerful platforms, who shape the Internet to their own advantage.<p>People have lost trust in the Internet. They don’t have control over it, and they don’t own the things online that are most important to them. It is time for a change. A big one. We need a new model for how the Internet should work – one that puts people back in charge – and the Crypto team at Reddit is leading the way.<p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape the future of the Internet. The Crypto team is a special team at Reddit designed to take on a moonshot project: building an entirely new model for the Internet and social media on top of blockchain and decentralized technologies. With Reddit’s 500 million users and tens of thousands of communities, our goal is to reach widespread, mainstream adoption of a more decentralized Internet where people, not platforms, have real ownership and control.<p>The way there is not easy. We are looking for a Staff Backend Engineer who wants to work on hard, unsolved problems – such as making blockchain scale to millions of people, designing new incentive models for decentralized networks, and building the right tools to empower people and communities to take control of their lives online.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;",

      "text": "I&#x27;m running a startup that&#x27;s pretty active on Twitter and LinkedIn. We&#x27;ve got Instagram and Facebook accounts to hold onto the name, but our target audience don&#x27;t seem hugely active on there, so we rarely post there.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about what to do with the IG and FB accounts recently, and I&#x27;m not too sure. It feels wrong to hold onto the names just because we might one day use them, but it also seems to make sense from a brand perspective.<p>My question, I suppose, is what do you think is best practice on this front and why?",
