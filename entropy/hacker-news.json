      "text": "Hi HN.<p>I&#x27;m currently enrolled in a graduate CS program in Europe (started half a year ago, another one and a half years to go). I&#x27;ve recently gotten an exciting opportunity (via some contacts from a previous internship) to work on a new project for a fairly prestigious company and I&#x27;m tempted to go for it. I&#x27;ve been somewhat unhappy with how interesting&#x2F;challenging the degree is and covid isn&#x27;t making it any more fun either. If I go for the opportunity I would quit pursuing my master degree, which of course leaves me to wonder what I&#x27;d lose. I&#x27;ve got some fairly active open source contributions&#x2F;projects and some professional&#x2F;extracurricular experience going for me, and I&#x27;m wondering whether in a couple years that&#x27;ll way up against a master degree.<p>Is there anyone here with similar experience? Anyone who can comment on whether in their experience the lack of a master degree is a problem?<p>I&#x27;m in CS&#x2F;robotics and the job is in that field, also I&#x27;m located in Europe and am expecting to stay there.<p>Thanks.",
