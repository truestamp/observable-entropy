Have only been actively (7hrs+ &#x2F;wk) learning&#x2F;applying this stuff for the last ~5mths, &amp; am still (or yet to) learning many fundamentals!<p>However, I&#x27;ve been reading a LOT about Rust &amp; Zig (&amp; several others, but I must &#x27;draw the line&#x27; -LOL!) on HN, and I&#x27;m very impressed&#x2F;intrigued.<p>Would it be okay if I switched most of my focus to them, or would that be a &quot;mistake&quot;? It&#x27;s more of a hobby all this stuff, but I do kind of want it to be a career longer-term.<p>I think I&#x27;ll always come back to js&#x2F;python &amp; related anyway, as it&#x27;s just so embedded in everything nowadays. But thinking more &amp; more, that I would like that learning to be an offshoot&#x2F;tie-in to my experiences&#x2F;learnings via Rust &amp; Zig.<p>Is this wrong-headed???<p>Thank-you.",
