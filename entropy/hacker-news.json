I’d like to stay up to date with current important  events (stuff like the evergiven ship, COVID status updates, major scandals, etc) without wasting time reading fluff. If I download a typical news aggregator app like Google News, I know that it will simply become the scrolling habit that Reddit and HN were. Can anyone think of any solutions for this? I’d be willing to pay a subscription.",
