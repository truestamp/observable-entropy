      "text": "I really enjoy it when I see programmers with a deranged disregard for aesthetics in the name of efficiency or productivity. Some of my favorited examples from my own experience:<p>- An <i>extremely</i> productive, like, 100x senior engineer I know works on a stock Ubuntu box with the default desktop wallpaper and an un-customized IntelliJ IDE and when he opens an IDE window he doesn&#x27;t even full screen or center it. Just blasting code in an un-centered 68% width IDE.<p>- The smartest person I know (like, easily) uses the tcsh shell, the nvi editor, and the twm or ratpoision window manager, all ancient, unmaintained tools. I think they were the state of the art when he started using Unix and he never bothered switching.<p>- I saw a very clever bitcoin developer just set `contenteditable=&quot;true&quot;` on an HTML element and use it as a text editor, I think because he already had the window open.<p>- Another developer I know with insane quality standards just names things &quot;foo&quot; when he can&#x27;t think of a name for things, to the point where we worked on a project together for a month in a repo called &quot;foo&quot; until we came up with a name.<p>What are some good examples you&#x27;ve witnessed?",

      "text": "Most of the blogs I read about whiteboarding and leetcode style questions come together with hate. “It doesn’t test real world scenarios” or “not proof of how well I’m gonna do at the job”.<p>Do you agree with those? Or is it just the case that the tests are designed to see if the person applying is actually really smart and interviewers want to work with really smart people, and those complaining about these types of questions are just not good enough?<p>Honest question and I’m not taking any side although I admit it I tried to phrase it more towards getting favourable FAANG responses",
