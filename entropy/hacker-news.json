      "text": "Companies are still referring to their major round of interviews as &quot;on-site&quot;, but that name doesn&#x27;t make too much sense anymore as everyone is still interviewing remotely. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that even if many companies go back to the office, they&#x27;ll still be hosting most of their candidates in office for interviews. Flying people out and putting them in hotels is expensive. Even if they&#x27;re willing to bare that cost, having the candidate take a vacation day to come in is also messy.<p>Is it possible that many years from now, companies will be inviting job candidates for &quot;virtual on-site&quot; interviews, and everyone involved wouldn&#x27;t even remember a time when interviews were actually &quot;on-site&quot;.",
