      "text": "Hi everyone,<p>Help with this would be greatly appreciated. I’ve been waiting for over 2 1&#x2F;2 months for Coinbase to unlock my account that my funds are locked in. I continue to receive the same generic email response. Chatted with various reps via Twitter DM and I seem to be getting absolutely nowhere. Has anyone else dealt with this terrible customer service from Coinbase? I have a lot of my personal funds just tied into the account with no access to withdraw, much less buy&#x2F;sell any of my coins.<p>I have been very patient and I don’t know where else to look or who else to contact.",
