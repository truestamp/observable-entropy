      "text": "Hey HN,<p>Software Debugging is to me the funnest part of software development, and it occurred to me to write a book on it, adding some of my experience to the area.<p>As an entry point to the book, I thought of writing a Review Paper on the subject, and as such, I have to read as many papers as I can find to review. So my question is: do you have a paper recommendation on Software Debugging that&#x27;s not in the list below? Any other tips or advice on writing a paper are also welcome.

      "text": "I am in the current session of Hack Reactor. Galvanize has basically removed all Hack Reactor branding from the instructional content.<p>Hack Reactor no longer offers any in-person courses or an SF campus.[1]<p>There appear to be about 30 students in the course, in the entire Western US (not just CA). They literally can&#x27;t fill sessions. The internal Slack is completely dead.<p>Worst of all, the material so far hasn&#x27;t been updated in at least 10 years, judging by the dates on the latest commits. We&#x27;re learning early 2000&#x27;s Doug Crockford-style JS. I wonder if the rest of the course material is like this, too.<p>The course still costs ~$20K.<p>Is Hack Reactor basically dead? Are there any Bay Area bootcamps that are a better deal and offer industry networking or employer contacts?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hackreactor.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;shift-to-remote-software-engineering-education",
