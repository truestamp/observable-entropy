      "text": "Hi HN; I&#x27;m at a bit of a low point, because I have some startups that I want to launch but I seem to mess up every possible business relationship that I would need to be able to make it work.<p>This happens due to past trauma and abandonment; I&#x27;m anticipating that things will go wrong, to the extent that anything I don&#x27;t understand could cause me to panic and give a reaction to that would seem emotionally incoherent to the other person, and therefore a red flag.<p>It&#x27;s really not easy to fix this, finding a psychologist that understands it is not easy, and people that you don&#x27;t know are not likely to give you a second chance if they see something weird. Additionally, it&#x27;s very hard to get any feedback at all, since it&#x27;s not comfortable for most people to talk about.<p>Has anyone had to solve this for themselves? I understand it will be different for everyone, but I would be interested in hearing about any strategies or workarounds. I&#x27;m not that confident about being able to solve it with a therapist in the short term, so I&#x27;m open to other ideas, for example, hiring staff to aid in communications, or different communication strategies.<p>Many thanks.",
