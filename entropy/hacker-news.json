      "text": "Hello all,<p>for many months my custom bulit gaming PC from 2014 has been sitting around my appartment, not finding any use. I am working mostly on my laptop from work nowadays and I stopped playing games for the most part. The GPU is a Nvidia GTX 780.<p>Recently, I started using machine learning tools on my work laptop and realized I have a reasonably strong GPU sitting around - or so I thought. Looking up the requirements for pytorch I found that the GTX780&#x27;s CUDA version has long since lost support and now I wonder what to do with the GPU, or even the whole system, as gaming is not important to me anymore and for an ML box it&#x27;s too old apparently.<p>I know I could sell it, but I&#x27;m wondering if anybody might have ideas on what such old hardware could still be used for?<p>Cheers,\n- V<p>Edit: spelling",
