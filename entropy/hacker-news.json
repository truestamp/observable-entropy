But the discussions were mostly curious, and people trying to learn more, even when they didn&#x27;t really understand any value of the thing, or when they thought it might be bad.<p>Contrast that with how the discussions on HN are today, where there are basically two camps that are just screaming at each other. Curious conversations about cryptocurrencies on HN are basically gone, and one group yells how great everything is while the other one is warning of the impeding doom and zero use cases.<p>Why did it get like this? Is the sentiment similar on other social media? Is there any particular reason cryptocurrencies are so divisive while other subjects are not?",
