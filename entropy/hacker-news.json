      "text": "I started at a new company 6 months ago. I&#x27;m enjoying the work (good challenges, nice software stack, etc). I&#x27;ve been in this area for 20+ years and I love it. We have monthly performance reviews and I&#x27;m getting good feedback. I do think I&#x27;m improving our codebase on a daily basis.<p>One coworker DM&#x27;ed me that I should probably slowdown. I also noticed another has not reviewed my PRs for many weeks now. I&#x27;m getting a feeling that I&#x27;m upsetting people.<p>I work from home, sometimes at odd hours. Many of my colleagues are from Europe (different work&#x2F;life balance).<p>Should I just keep doing my thing?",
