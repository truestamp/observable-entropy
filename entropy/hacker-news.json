      "text": "Hey HN!<p>The race to $50k&#x2F;year is on :)  My wife wants to train my son to get a High School diploma and I want to get him either working for himself or a company making $50k&#x2F;year.  He get&#x27;s to be independent when he achieves either one of these :)  I am pulling for the $50K&#x2F;yr and figured I would engage the giant amazing HN collective brain for this challenge :)<p>My 14 year old son loves coding, making Roblox games, creating Youtube movies and I said let&#x27;s set a goal, when you get to $50k&#x2F;year you can move out&#x2F;be independent&#x2F;don&#x27;t have to homeschool anymore! He said LET&#x27;S DO THIS DAD!!! :P LOL!<p>HN Dads: If you are interested I would love to partner up to help ALL our kids get to $50k&#x2F;yr and be independent, I know we can do this!  This is just an idea right now and I will be stumbling my way through it but would love your thoughts, ideas, help?<p>I have started teaching him about First Principles and also reached out to Roblox asking them what HARD problems they are trying to solve as well as any missing GAPS in talent&#x2F;content&#x2F;etc.<p>Interested in joining up and helping kids everywhere?  Feel free to email me at titus@jesuswantsyou.org and&#x2F;or post your thoughts, advice, below.<p>Please keep comments clean, constructive and kind, my son will be reading them :)<p>Thanks and God Bless,<p>Titus",
