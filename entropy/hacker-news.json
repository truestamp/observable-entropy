      "text": "Lately, I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m spending a lot of time on HN. I&#x27;ve also realized that my brain uses it as a some sort of &quot;escape&quot; route: whenever I&#x27;m dealing with something complicated, my brain defaults to Cmd+T + &quot;news..&quot;.<p>So I&#x27;ve decided that I need to stop continuously browsing HN. BUT, I still don&#x27;t want to miss the relevant news, events and discussions.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve built this very simple, statically generated summary of HN posts (by year, month and week): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn-summary.github.io&#x2F;<p>I think it&#x27;s also a good way to filter the noise and only focus on those relevant posts that had a considerable impact on their given week.<p>I&#x27;ve also grouped the submissions on different (and arbitrary) groups that I consider relevant (for example: News, Dev Blogs, Scientific News, etc). Feel free to suggest changes&#x2F;additions (it&#x27;s all in a json file within the repo).<p>I guess the only thing left is block news.ycombinator.com on my &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts :)<p>[Source] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hn-summary&#x2F;hn-summary.github.io",
