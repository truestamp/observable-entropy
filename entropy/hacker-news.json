      "text": "Hi HN. I’m considering taking HRT to present as female. I’ve had gender dysphoria since at least puberty about twenty years ago. The idea of transitioning seems <i>fun</i> to me and I wonder if it might help me enjoy life more.<p>I’m generally handsome (afaict), fit, basically happy enough, in therapy, have decent luck with dating, on senior staff at Google if that helps (i.e. financially secure and with good benefits for trans matters at work).<p>I’m asking HN as it tends to be a curious, yet skeptical and sometimes rigorous community.<p>My question is: how can I know if this is the right decision for me? Are there good ways of “prototyping” this decision? Is there any great scientific research that is good at predicting outcomes (i.e. whether transitioning improves quality of life or not)?<p>Thanks so much. Anonymous account for privacy, but a long time poster.",
