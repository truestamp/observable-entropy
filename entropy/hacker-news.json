      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I started Movably to take a crack at solving the whole &quot;sitting is the new smoking&quot;, &quot;the best posture is your next posture&quot;, and “you can&#x27;t just exercise away the effects of sitting” problem.<p>The trick is to have enough movement to protect health and prevent issues, all without disrupting work flow.<p>We have come up with a smart interactive chair for your standing desk—the first of its kind. It lets you move easily, as often as every few minutes, between a set of postures over the course of a day. It works with you at standing height so it isn’t as disturbing as raising&#x2F;lowering a sit-stand desk or walking on a treadmill.  Because your center of gravity maintains its relationship to the work surface it becomes almost automatic really quickly.  And with our chair normal sitting is just a posture too, you can sit when you need to (but not all the time!).  This will give you an idea of how it works: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dC__YxuEGBU<p>We have had good results with initial trials so far with a number of people saying this has reduced and even eliminated their back pain, soreness, etc. All without disrupting their productivity. In fact, some even reported that it enhanced productivity.<p>We would like to learn more about what types of usage&#x2F;posture patterns work best for a broader group of users and different kinds of deskwork: coding, video editing, writing, gaming, etc. We&#x27;d love to find some current standing desk users interested in testing one of our chair prototypes for up to a week or two and give us feedback.  We have chairs circulating in the Bay area, NYC, and Boston.  If interested let us know here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;movably.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;Nyo8603J?typeform-source=admin.typeform.com<p>And am happy to answer any questions!<p>Thank you,\nMark",
