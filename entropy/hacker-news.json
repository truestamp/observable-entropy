      "text": "I grew up in the US, lived in Spain for several years and now regularly visit my in-laws.<p>I&#x27;m currently staying in what I would call an average apartment block with ~40 units built in the late 70s or early 80s.<p>As far as I can tell there are no smoke detectors or sprinklers and there is definitely no alternative egress like a fire escape. And I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been to any residence in Spain that has either (but I&#x27;m not always checking).<p>Fire deaths per capita are considerably lower in Spain than in the US[0] where my <i>impression</i> is there is a huge emphasis on fire safety equipment like smoke detectors and sprinklers.<p>I expect that smoke detectors and sprinklers save lives - or certainly hard to argue that they don&#x27;t at the margin regardless of the type of building they are installed in.<p>What&#x27;s going on? Why doesn&#x27;t my in-law&#x27;s apartment have smoke detectors and sprinklers? Is my family actually sleeping in a death trap?<p>Some possible explanations I can think of:\n* Different building materials and building codes - On average Spanish residences more fire resistant because of their construction<p>* Cost - smoke detectors and sprinklers drive up costs and getting adoption might be hard if they only save a small number of marginal lives. Even if I would argue that makes them worth it everywhere<p>* Business&#x2F;Politics - Fire safety manufacturers have had more success in the US getting their devices into building codes and legislation<p>* Rescue&#x2F;Fire Suppression - this seems very unlikely (figure firefighting and evacuation techniques are pretty universal in the developed world) but I guess Spanish firefighters could be better at getting fires out and people evacuated<p>I have been wondering about this for more than a decade and this seems like a good international community to find someone who might know or people interested in the topic. I&#x27;d love people&#x27;s thoughts.<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldlifeexpectancy.com&#x2F;cause-of-death&#x2F;fires&#x2F;by-country&#x2F;",
