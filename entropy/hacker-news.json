      "text": "I found an open source tool that doesn&#x27;t provide a cloud-host solution, you need to install on your own server.<p>I think it may be a good business idea to provide a service where people pay to use it without worrying about installation, mantainence, updates, scalability, etc.<p>My question is not only if there is a market for that, but what about rights&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;exposing the original open source tool? The documentation should be replicated for my customers in how to use it? What about languages libraries? I should fork them?<p>Thank you very much.",
