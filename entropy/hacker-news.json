      "text": "I&#x27;m working on a small membership project and would like to have a simple payment option but it seems like every platform that I want to use only integrates with stripe and so I feel kind of stuck because all of the good options, eg memberful, ghost.org and the like are pretty much impossible for me to use.<p>At this point I have been considering  opening a stripe account with using a fake address in the UK and then transferring the money from there to a wise bank account. But this feels like it&#x27;s veering to close to fraud for me and I&#x27;m not even sure if it would work anyway. So just curious what people from unsupported stripe countries are doing.<p>Thanks!",
