We – a team from Harvard Business School and UC Berkeley Haas - are conducting a study to better understand how startup’s location decisions are made. We would especially like to know what types of environments are the most beneficial for nascent firms and how you as a founder interact with others in your work neighborhood. To shed light on this, we - and future founders - need your help!\nWe would really appreciate you taking the time to complete our survey.\nIt will take around 5 minutes (or less) to answer all the questions.\nThank you!<p>Prof. Maria Roche and Sahiba Chopra",
