      "text": "Currently been interviewing at a FAANG-ish company, started in June.<p>The first two months were the actual interviews (multiple rounds of code challenges, arch reviews, culture fit, etc). The last two and a half months have all been HR and paperwork intensive in terms of getting the offer approved internally.<p>How long has it taken others to get through the process? This is by far the longest interview cycle I&#x27;ve ever had and was wondering whether waiting this long for an offer is acceptable, even for FAANG level jobs.",
