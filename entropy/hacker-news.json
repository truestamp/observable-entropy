      "text": "Most of my family is in Russia. Connectivity to twitter&#x2F;facebook has already been degraded by Russian gov, with full ban being likely in the next weeks. Simultaneously Russian gov has been banning popular VPN providers since 2019[1]. I&#x27;m US based, and have been thinking about setting up private VPN to ensure internet access for my family.<p>Has anyone setup a private VPN service for themselves or for their family lately? What provider and stack have you used? Do you think it was worth it? Any other tips?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techradar.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;russia-has-banned-a-whole-load-more-vpn-services",
