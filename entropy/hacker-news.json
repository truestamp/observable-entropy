      "text": "Would you like to know the never told story of the first convicted hacker in IT history? Do check this out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;thehackerprince&#x2F;the-hacker-prince-a-true-story<p>The book author, Mike Wilkerson, is a good friend of mine, and I had the chance to read an early draft of his teenager story, when he basically hacked Microsoft and other firms and got caught at a time the first anti-pirating laws came into existence.  This story was not only never told, but presents an amazing insight into the 80&#x27;s hacker community. And there is on top of it an incredible twist that I cannot reveal and you&#x27;ll have to discover for yourself.<p>PS: the FBI video is also a treat to watch",
