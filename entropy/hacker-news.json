      "text": "Hi, my mom have an old laptop and is working really slow. I want to improve my mom&#x27;s experience. She just use it to browse the web; check emails, read articles, maybe some video. I want to ask you what OS you recommend to install.<p>Here is the situation:<p>HARDWARE&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;\nToshiba Satellite C655 (2011ish)  \n- CPU Intel Pentium T4500 @ 2.30GHz\n- Video LP156WH2-TLAA (1366x768@60Hz)\n- 2GB RAM\n- 230 GB<p>SOFTWARE\n- Windows 10 (pre-installed, upgraded to 10 trough the years), zero extra apps on startup.\n- Recently installed a clean Ubuntu 21.10 in dual boot.\n- She uses Firefox with Ublock Origin.<p>EXPERIENCE\nIt is just really slow.\nWindows is a nightmare, like 10 seconds to display the start menu, ages to open Firefox and do stuff, even typing gets delayed sometimes. I installed Ubuntu to see if it gets better, it feels more snappy, now she is using that, but still slow to respond and interact.<p>Any suggestions? Thanks.<p>Edit: Sorry I don&#x27;t know how to do line breaks here instead of paragraphs. The post is messed up.",
