      "text": "Hi HN!<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a rough plan for my college independent work this fall semester that is going to be focused on making an ORM in Racket.<p>I&#x27;m interested in the &quot;DSL&quot; programming style of Racket since I&#x27;ve never tried such a thing, as well as building a large project written in a LISP utilizing all the features like macros, as I&#x27;ve also never tried serious LISP programming despite being a fan for a long time (in part due to pg&#x27;s blog and otherwise for Emacs).<p>So far my plan is to learn Racket this summer, and then in the fall use the Stanford database course on edX to learn about relational algebra, and then take a look at a preexisting ORM&#x2F;ORM DSL for inspiration as I write my own. Resources on any of those, or alternative suggestions would be fantastic!<p>For some context on my background, I&#x27;ve taken Data Structures and Algorithms, Functional Programming, and Compilers.<p>Thanks for your help!",
