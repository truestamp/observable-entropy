      "text": "so I&#x27;m wondering if this is something that the HN community wonders about: If you were interested in doing a project (personal or otherwise), where do you go to find others who might be interested in discussing it together? Is this something you find difficult?<p>Some examples I can think of:<p>- you&#x27;re interested in working in area X, but have little experience in it (say, edtech). Are there open projects that you can join to learn more?<p>- you&#x27;re interested in doing a niche project (say, translating the Iliad). On the internet, there might be someone who&#x27;s interested, but where do you find them?<p>- etc<p>Any personal experiences welcome :) Thanks yall",
