      "text": "Hi HN --<p>After a thread a couple of weeks ago (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28866242) got more attention than I expected, and someone even suggested doing a Show HN (thanks wanderingmind)-- so, here goes:<p>We&#x27;re building a network of local journalists, along with others in national verticals. Our incentive structure exists in a way to promote news people want to come back to read, not clickbait headlines, divisive or anger driving hot takes, or lowest common denominator coverage. All geared to 18-34 year olds, who are less likely to consume local news in the traditional forms, like subscribing to a local paper or watching broadcast TV.<p>It&#x27;s still early stages; but we&#x27;re proving out the concept.  Newsrooms are infamously understaffed, so asking them to take on another platform is usually a nonstarter.  Instead, we offer free, proprietary communication tools to help the staff communicate (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nillium.com&#x2F;newsrooms) and that syndicates updates out automatically.<p>As we&#x27;re onboarding traditional newsroom partners, we&#x27;re also pushing forward with college students (see Ithaca, NY: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forthapp.com&#x2F;locale&#x2F;6174d42a63b3f0d8dbef92dc) and also automatically publishing White House Pool Reports (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forthapp.com&#x2F;dl&#x2F;whitehouse) which are public, but difficult to obtain if you aren&#x27;t in the media.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what you think.  And as an aside&#x2F;shameless plug, if you work for a newsroom or cover local news, please reach out -- we&#x27;d love to have you on board -- jared at nillium dot com.",
