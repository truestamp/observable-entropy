I have a dozen or so customers, and make enough money to cover costs but I’m years away from being able to live off it.<p>Every few weeks I get an email that goes something like this:<p>Hi, I’m an ethical hacker and I found some security vulnerabilities in your site. Attached is proof.<p>I expect a reward for this information, can you let me know how much you will pay, or should I share this exploit online?<p>———\nNow, none of the issues are very serious, nobody has been able to access data they shouldn’t have, they’re usually small things about header, XSS etc, but nevertheless valid.<p>I can’t really afford to pay them, and buy I also don’t want to suffer reputation loss.<p>At the same time, I don’t k ow that it’s realistic to have zero security recommendations as pretty much any project I’ve ever seen has some… although it’s a worthy target.<p>Any recommendations on how to deal with this?<p>1. Ignore them?\n2. Pay them?\n3. Thank them and ask them to move on<p>I usually fix the problem and to (3), but it’s concerning behaviour that seems to be increasing in frequency.",
