This is what it’s holding me back at the moment.<p>I am afraid that if I carry on with the startup idea and then fail my experience in the field will not be considered as “good” as the same period of time spent in a good company that has a big background and reputation.<p>So, if there’s some recruiters in here, how do you value a CV with no previous experience but maybe a year of two trying to raise a failed startup (ages &lt;30)?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would love to try the startup thing and I am very motivated and passionate for software engineering, but I also have to consider the downsides so that I can take responsibility for whatever I choose",
