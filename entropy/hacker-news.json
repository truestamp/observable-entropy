      "text": "Hey HN,<p>does anyone know, how I could enable kinetic scrolling with KDE and libinput, even if it is experimental?<p>Sidenote: I know that synaptics[1] and mtrack[2] kind of support Kinetic scrolling, but I would like to go for libinput, since the others showed some issues with my Trackpad and libinput is more future proof.<p>I&#x27;m trying to configure my touchpad with Arch-Linux, libinput and KDE to support kinetic scrolling. For those, who don&#x27;t know: Kinetic scrolling does not stop scrolling as soon as the fingers leave the touchpad, but slowly fades out the scrolling process.<p>Libinput works fine so far, but with X11, Kinetic Scrolling is not possible[3]. After checking the docs, I found out that it should be possible with Wayland.<p>KDE and Wayland are still not considered as stable[4], but I got it working for testing purposes. Unfortunately, libinput does not support generic configuration files, but has to be integrated into the Desktop Environment &#x2F; Compositor, and KDE has no config option to enable Kinetic scrolling.<p>It would be awesome, if someone could point me in the right direction on this.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.freedesktop.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=38909<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;p2rkw&#x2F;xf86-input-mtrack&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wayland.freedesktop.org&#x2F;libinput&#x2F;doc&#x2F;latest&#x2F;faqs.html#kinetic-scrolling-does-not-work<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kde.org&#x2F;announcements&#x2F;plasma&#x2F;5&#x2F;5.21.0&#x2F;#kwin-and-wayland",
