The worst part is that this person is a higher title than me and probably gets paid more than me.<p>My manager seems to be slightly aware of this but I&#x27;m not sure by how much exactly. It&#x27;s obviously quite frustrating on many different levels. Is there any scenario in which this makes sense for me to mention something to my manager or should I just keep my mouth shut?",
