      "text": "Hello HN,<p>We’re a small software consultancy (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;featurist.co.uk&#x2F;). We have been very successful writing web software for our clients for some 10 years now. However, we want to gradually transition to working on our own products. It’s more fun and hopefully more profitable too.<p>This is of course easier said than done. We did some research and figured that before anything else we need to speak to potential customers and understand their real pain points and where new products could help. We have then tried to engage with people directly (via twitter dm and reddit posts) but to no avail so far. It now feels like we’re doing something wrong and we should probably look for some help.<p>So here are my questions:<p>- How do consultancies make that hop in general? What are the key insights?\n- In our particular case, who are the people that could help and where do we find them?<p>Thanks!\nArtem",
