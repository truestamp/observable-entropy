      "text": "Hello,\nWondering how I can accept crypto payments, mainly eth, on my site.\nI know there are crypto payment gateways, but I want to do this myself.<p>I see there is a way to do it with metamask but I can&#x27;t seem to find the answer to one question.<p>Does the end user need a metamask wallet to payment on my site?<p>When looking at the code it suggests that but I&#x27;m not sure. And that seems rather limiting.<p>Thanks for the help.",
