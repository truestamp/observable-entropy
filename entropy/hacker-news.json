      "text": "Our 10-year-old son is having a really hard time making friends, which is all the more heartbreaking because prior to the pandemic he was Mr. Social.<p>He&#x27;s especially disheartened that his main friend group from school mostly have parents with fringe views we don&#x27;t share, and he just doesn&#x27;t enjoy being around them anymore.<p>We&#x27;re trying to (cautiously) explore in-person extracurriculars, but I&#x27;m wondering if there are any online services that might also be helpful.  We&#x27;ve tried penpals, but he&#x27;s really looking for more realtime interactions.  Of course, video chats have their own set of issues, so we&#x27;d only want to go that route if there&#x27;s strict vetting.",
