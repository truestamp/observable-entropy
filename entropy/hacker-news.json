      "text": "I&#x27;ve been researching a new payment system designed to compete with credit cards designed to do two things:<p>(1) Remove the &#x27;deadweight loss&#x27; in credit card fees\n(2) Outperform the incentive structure of all credit cards for their users<p>Venmo solves (1), but fails to address (2) because it doesn&#x27;t properly incentivize users like credit cards offering cash back, and isn&#x27;t perceived to be a legitimate form of payment for business.<p>My researched approach is to charge the same processing fee as credit card companies of around 3%, but rather offer an instant discount of the order at the merchant, rather than a points system. What this does is:<p>(1) Outperforms the reward system of any other payment system \n(2) Incentivizes consumers to spend more at SMB because they are getting a discount\n(3) Allows SMBs to pass on their fees to save the customer money\n(4) Creates instant gratification to the consumer<p>Because mobile pay is such a nominal percent of transactions, merchants would be given a small RFID sticker that could be appended to their existing POS or elsewhere and consumers would be given tap to pay embedded fabs synced to a mobile app to process transactions like credit cards. Fabs would not have numbers to avoid theft and would just have RFID embedded chips and be able to be stored on a keychain like YubiKey.<p>One potential solution is an enterprise Venmo system, that uses the fee-less transaction technology in the way that payments are processed.<p>If anyone has ideas, open to hearing them below, or anyone interested in pursuing this research.<p>--\nNotes:<p>There are of course other incentives with credit cards such as the chargeback capability and financing. However, it&#x27;s been cited 86% of chargebacks are &#x27;friendly fraud&#x27;, which further incentivizes SMBs and disincentivizes at-risk users. Financing may be outsourced and points charged for the rights to do so.",
