Is Facebook&#x2F;Meta beginning to get desperate that they launched new ad campaigns or is it just isolated to us?",

      "text": "We believe the mobile games and apps publishing ecosystem is poorly developed for indie developers, small studios, and small publishers.<p>The way it works -<p>1. A developer submits an app&#x2F;game prototype to various publishers.<p>2. Publishers review. They only contact the developer if they find the app&#x2F;game suitable to their business model.<p>3. They get into some revenue-sharing legal agreement. In most cases, if the developer is indie and does not understand legal language, the terms favor the publisher.<p>4. Afterward, the developer becomes a contractor for the publisher that most creative people hate.<p>This structure works well for large to mid-level publishers and well-funded game studios.<p>Similarly, the bar is high for small publishers and creative indie developers to get into this industry.<p>At AuctionVilla Marketplace, we are working toward breaking this monopoly and bringing more creative controls. We help developers to sell their mobile games and apps IPs, including the store listing for a fixed price or through auction.<p>We are currently working with around 25 developers and listed 14+ selected apps. As a trial earlier, we sold 59+ hyper-casual games for US$35,000 in 2019.<p>We are building our relationship with friendly publishers, and 10+ publishers expressed their interest.<p>We are at a super early stage. It would be a privilege to get some feedback.",
