      "text": "Hi HN, I’m James and I’m excited to share GuideLab, on-demand in-app guides to reduce support load and make your users happier.<p>After a decade of working on products with small (20k) and large (millions) user bases, one thing remained clear - level 1 support takes up a lot of time. From universal usability (’how do I reset my password?’, ’how do I invite team members?’) to product specific problems, the answer is sometimes in a chat bot or knowledge base, but it’s cumbersome for the user and often gets lost in translation.<p>Using GuideLab, you create in-app guides (think a chain of tooltips) which can then be shared with your users via a link (yourapp.com&#x2F;?guidelab=xxx-xxx-xxx) over any platform: email, Zendesk, social media, pre-existing knowledge base, Intercom etc. As soon as a user clicks the link, they’re taken to your app and instantly see the guide.<p>There’s also our search widget that you can embed directly in your web app; your users can then click the ‘Help Guides’ tab, search and follow any guide you’ve created. In that way GuideLab is fundamentally different to other guiding software like AppCues or userpilot. They focus on opting users into guides based on cohorts&#x2F;attributes whereas GuideLab lets users view guides when they need them most.<p>There’s a quick (&lt;1m) video on the homepage (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guidelab.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guidelab.io</a>) walking you through how GuideLab works. If you have any other questions, or if there’s anything you’d love to see in this space, please share (there’s a heap of product growth ahead for GuideLab… its a very exciting time!).",
