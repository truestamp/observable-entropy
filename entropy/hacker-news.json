      "text": "Hey everyone. I&#x27;v been working on this for a long time and want to finally show it to the public. I know this is a very crowded market but I think there is room for value to be added. I was looking at all of the popular site builders out there and came to the following conclusion:<p>1. The flexible&#x2F;powerful builders are intimidating and has a steep learning curve. Also they are slow on older computers and does not work on mobile.<p>2. The easy to use builders tends to be limiting in how you can design your site  and&#x2F;or how many pages that can be made per site.<p>3. All the popular builders are ~$150 a year. It&#x27;s just too expensive for someone who just want an online presence.<p>----------------------------------------<p>So I think there is room to give value in this market if I can achieve these 3 requirements:<p>1. Flexibility. I wanted designers to be able to create what they came up with in their heads. No inflexible blocks and elements. All elements have access to all of the major used css styles.<p>2. Accessibility. I don&#x27;t want people to spend ~$150 a year on one website with no ads. A lot of people can&#x27;t drop that much money at once. Likewise, not everyone has powerful machines; the product needs to be buttery smooth on old, slower devices. Lastly, the product needs to be  fully functional on mobile so users can edit on the go.<p>3. Easy to use. I want the product to have a low learning curve. Users only need to understand how a container works to make every layout possible. Pre-made sections and templates are available for building quickly and easily. Copy and pasting between sites is also possible.<p>Do you guys think I came relatively close or just wasted my time? Any feedback would be appreciated (no registration is required to use the platform).",
