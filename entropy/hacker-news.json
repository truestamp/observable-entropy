      "text": "Please do not dismiss me as a bad person right away, here is the thing: Not sure if I am just old-fashioned or a boomer in the body of 30 year old, but I have trouble fitting in modern IT hipster working environment. I tried to solve this by working in the companies with less progressive approach to work, but it is inevitable that hipsters will start joining my present company too. Note that I do not hate them. I just feel I have problem to fit in, because my mindset is different. And it&#x27;s not just about the age, I&#x27;ve met many people that are older than me with the behavior described in the following points:<p>What I like:\n- Supportive mindset\n- Flexibility, willingness to use latest technologies\n- Easy to have small talk with<p>My struggles:\n- Massive amounts of soy lattes, excessive friendliness that seems almost fake.\n- MacBook obsession aka &quot;I think we should all use MacBooks, they are best and it creates nice unified vibe...&quot;\n- They want to change the world, engage in activism but are less willing to change their own toxic behavior and&#x2F;or character.\n- Seemingly random working time, daily alcohol or drug consumption that affects work performance =&gt; mood swings\n- Unable to use email, if someone (client ,colleague) refuses to use Slack it&#x27;s insurmountable problem.\n- Spending lot of money at Barber&#x27;s and for avocado toasts, complaining about no money for rent (I think here I have some common ground :) )<p>Note that I don&#x27;t judge someone for being like this, I understand that world is changing and so does the work culture. I am just honestly looking for a way to fit in and find a way to effectively cooperate with these people. Any suggestion are welcome!",
