Importantly, unlimited pto never works in the workers favor for some reason.<p>One of the ideas I’ve been mulling is mandating a vacation and a long one at that. I’ve heard many industries already take a fairly long summer break in EU, so I suppose this is similar.<p>One worry I’ve heard is our work will be delayed due to this break but maybe it won’t? I feel rejuvenated good engineers would be more productive in 10 months than worn down ones in 12.<p>There’s also the practical logistics of running an always on service, but I feel like for most tech companies this should be doable with a skeleton support staff (even if that) especially if we freeze the code weeks before we leave work.<p>Would love anyones thoughts on how this might work and what the pitfalls would be (and also to ask if this would entice the best engineers as much as I believe).",
