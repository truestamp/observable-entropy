      "text": "Has anyone taken the plunge to work in engineering, or security engineering, in the EU or UK, <i>and</i> done it at an venture-backed place that is similar to what you&#x27;d find in the US?<p>Upfront: I get that the EU is not a monolith market, and I&#x27;m excluding asking about jobs that are pseudo-offshore eng shops for places in the US (Poland, UKR, etc). I&#x27;m interested in learning about the in bonafide startup scene and related jobs, or working for FAANG&#x2F;Bank EU&#x2F;UK.<p>- Generally, does one get out there on a venture-backed job, or is mostly taking a job at Google Zurich or a US bank in the UK (that sort of thing).<p>- What cities have the venture-backed scenes; do certain cities&#x2F;countries  differentiate b&#x2F;t having more earlier or later round companies? How similar&#x2F;dissimilar is the experience to working at Series B-&gt;D place in the US?<p>- How important is English, especially at non-Big Tech&#x2F;Big Finance jobs?<p>- Pay, what&#x27;s to be expected, and do the $150k+ equivalent eng jobs exist there? Why I specify security engineering is infosec roles in the EU&#x2F;UK tend to seem <i>really</i> low comparative pay at initial pass. I get the &quot;but the quality of life&#x2F;social services&quot; aspect of the pay there.<p>- How do visas work if you go to work at a startup. Are visas sponsored?",
