      "text": "Formal methods (theorem proving, model checking, static analysis, abstract interpretation, advanced type systems, program semantics, etc) have remained a relatively niche topic during the last two and a half decades. The field saw much interest during the 1980s and early 1990s. Tony Hoare&#x27;s 1996 speech recognized formal methods were so far unable to scale to real-world software [1], and that event perhaps marked the beginning of a formal methods winter.<p>Do you think the field is starting to regain attention? I have observed many positive indicators:<p>* Strong interest in the mathematics community to mechanize proofs, driven by Lean<p>* Some technical milestones, such as end-to-end proofs carried by the DeepSpec project<p>* Emerging synergies with AI, e.g. synthesis<p>* Some job openings in mainstream companies, e.g. Google<p>* Respectable number of grant calls and studentships related to the topic, growing from close to zero<p>* Funded work by cryptocurrency platforms to verify smart contracts, after multi-million fiascos<p>Is this a promising field to work on? What advances do you expect during this decade?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions",
