      "text": "Recently, this book, as well as Clean Code, has received plenty of negative feedback and skepticism with regard to its wisdom and applicability.<p>I am not yet experienced enough to assess such judgements, but I would really like to truly master this &quot;clean architecture&quot; if it ever exists.<p>Can you please comment on:<p>* What you think is wrong with Clean Architecture and how bad it really is<p>* What you can recommend instead<p>FWIW, my programming language of choice is Go so a lot of things typical of Java (for example) are not directly applicable here. Even worse, some of them might do more harm than good whereas Go aims for simplicity. Nonetheless, with the elegant interfaces in Go, it feels like it fits the SOLID philosophy even better, but someone has yet to extensively cover that.",
