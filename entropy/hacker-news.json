      "text": "Dear HN,<p>I know that when you&#x27;ve been wronged by a competitor, you can book a case insurance and&#x2F;or hire an attorney on commission where they&#x27;ll get paid as a percentage of the settlement that they win. That&#x27;s also why attorney sometimes try to drum up class-action lawsuits.<p>I&#x27;m now wondering if anyone knows a similar system for patents, where you effectively team up with an attorney to patent your invention&#x2F;product and then sell the rights together, meaning the attorney gets a cut of the revenue that he&#x2F;she enabled.<p>The reason I&#x27;m asking is because I see a catch 22 situation otherwise: To pay for patent coverage, you need investment. But disclosing your technical moat to get investment is risky without patents. And to financially prove the usefulness of a patent, you need to manufacture the product. But if you do that without patents, you&#x27;re going to compete with a copy of yourself on Alibaba.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve heard that there should be public funding for technology research and resulting IP in Europe, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any &quot;starting point&quot; position to contact.<p>In general, how would you approach securing a product before you send the files to China for manufacturing?",
