      "text": "Hi everyone,<p>I am a phd student in infosec and working on a paper covering multi-party cyber incidents (ripple events). \nthe problem is the data. most of the white papers use advisen data but they are &#x27;a little&#x27; hesitant to share&#x2F;sell the data, given that I am just a student :)<p>VERIS (VCDB) database consists of all incidents. I can manually check every incident to see if there is any correlation between those events, but you know... this takes ages.<p>Do you have any other suggestions? I need the company name, threat (type) action, timeline, and which companies are impacted (the breach propagated).<p>Such that target breach  propagated to companies x, y, and z in 2013 .",
