Ransomware can have bigger payouts but is worse in every other way compared to giveaway scam. Giveaway scams fly under radar of the media , law enforcement , chain analytic companies. But if the scammers are in Russia, then   nothing can be done anyway.<p>Given how much money these ppl make and the inability of anyone to do anything, and the endless stream of victims, it is obvious why the scams persist.<p>The total mount stolen from YouTube scams is probably around $40 million at current prices over the past few year from a combination of XRP, BTC, DOGE, and ETH, which is less than ransomware but divided among far fewer people, so it&#x27;s more lucrative.",
