      "text": "I&#x27;m currently using a desktop both at work and at home. But I want to switch to a laptop. But I don&#x27;t want to give up more performance than necessary. And I don&#x27;t want to pay for a GPU. My requirements:<p>- 8 Cores or more(Ryzen H&#x2F;HS or Alder Lake H-series)\n- 32GB RAM\n- Good cooling (without too much noise)\n- No external GPU<p>I haven&#x27;t found any good options. I basically want a Asus Zephyrus G14 without the GPU.<p>Are there any  options out there I haven&#x27;t found?",
