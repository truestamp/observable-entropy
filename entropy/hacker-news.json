      "text": "After reading a HN thread about Ansible tricks and the expected debate about whether or not Ansible is actually good, I felt like a discussion around that specific topic was useful. Here&#x27;s my current case:<p>I have a field deployed appliance that needs to be able to update automatically. Today, since we&#x27;re still in an early phase, the fee I have deployed are accessible over SSH. This won&#x27;t be the future case though. While in the current mode, I use Ansible over SSH to push changes. It works well enough but we&#x27;re doing a bit of a pivot and now feels like the right time to do the rearch and move to a pull based model.<p>I&#x27;ve used Puppet, Chef and Ansible over the years and I could make this work with any one of them. I have not use Salt and my experience with cfengine is about 20 years ago. I&#x27;m curious to see if there&#x27;s some compelling reason to get away from the devil I know right now (Ansible) that I&#x27;m missing. Salt gets brought up a lot but I rarely see arguments for or against and many of the articles I&#x27;ve read make it all seem like a coin toss.<p>Any have strong feelings backed by data?",
