And i have no idea under what condition the noise will be produced again.<p>Sure, the easies strategy here is to ask EPA dispatch more inspections (increase frequency), but the EPA staff also tell me that if they came too many times but founds nothing will think I am doing a prank call.<p>So what i am asking is, is there a math strategy that can help me more precisely dispatch inspections (i think an overall 60% precision will be excellent) to catch the noise.<p>This is just an idea. I am really tired to dealing with this annoying problem, and running out strategy.",
