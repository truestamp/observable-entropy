      "text": "Non-Googler here who is curiousâ€”news reports tend to say that tech talent is fleeing New York&#x2F;SF and moving to Austin&#x2F;Charlotte&#x2F;etc. But I have a couple of Google friends who work in other offices and have had a really tough time trying to transfer to New York, and have said they anecdotally heard New York is the most popular office (allegedly something like 1,000 more people transferred into New York than transferred out).<p>This is anecdata... does anyone have any &quot;real&quot; data on this? Seems like Google would be an interesting bellweather for the future of legacy urban centers like New York, at least from a tech perspective.",
