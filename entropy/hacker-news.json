      "text": "Recently i joined a new team working on an e-commerce website for a big company, we use Bitbucket Cloud for version control and Microsoft Teams for communication.<p>First thing i had to do is to fix some minor bugs so i fixed them after that i opened a pull request, what was surprising for me is the time it takes (2 days) to have my pull request validated and merged, so by curiosity i asked my tech lead about that he said sometimes when he receives email from Bitbucket to review some PRs he simply ignores it because maybe he didn’t have space at that time. And i was like it’s easy it should be some bitbucket and microsoft teams integration app that can helps us to solve this issue, indeed we found it and we gave it a try it was working fine every time someone open a PR we get notified to do the review but it didn’t solve the problem, why ? Because we receive the notifications and if we ignore it because of bad timing we don’t have any kind of reminders to do so. And really this was the real issue for us and we didn’t find a way to solve it til now.<p>This weekend i was thinking why not building it my self and maybe share it with other developers having same issue what do you think is it a great idea ? I need your feedbacks, And I built a simple landing page to collect some developers emails for the beta version if you think that it could solve your issue you could leave your email to get notified when the beta is released.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pullthunder.com",
