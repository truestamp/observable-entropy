Do you know of any hardware advances that this gap is going to shrink sometime in the future?<p>I&#x27;m thinking about data structures, which are currently outperformed by smarter cache-line friendly algorithms as for instance balanced mutable binary search trees vs smart trie or B-tree implementations. These index structures are of course meant as an example for the wide range of algorithms, which have to take cache-lines into account nowadays.<p>Do you think these &quot;old&quot; algorithms are getting some kind of renaissance in the future?",
