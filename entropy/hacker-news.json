I have configured it so that it shows me the text part of the emails I get.<p>Unfortunately, every now and then the text part is so broken that I would like to render the HTML part.<p>But it seems like Thunderbird does not offer a way to do this for a single email.<p>Looking at the source code of such an email, there is no plain HTML but some gibberish with &quot;Content-Type: multipart&#x2F;alternative;&quot; or &quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable&quot;.<p>Any ideas how to go about this?",
