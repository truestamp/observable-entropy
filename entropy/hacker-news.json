Do you know of similar sites still running?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been doing interviews with Series B-D startups and one issue that seems to recur is a lack of management experience.  Generally, an engineer gets promoted to some level of management, but never learns how to manage.  Hard conversations aren&#x27;t happening, feedback isn&#x27;t constructive, and the people aspect is left to fend for itself.  That&#x27;s all on top of standard organization challenges like team structure.<p>Generally, I&#x27;d expect the CTO&#x2F;VP&#x2F;Director to have more management experience, but in a lot of these cases, they may have the resume, but not the skills.<p>Has anyone had a career from selling management coaching or consulting on these issues?",
