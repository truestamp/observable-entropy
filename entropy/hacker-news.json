Whenever I send my resume, I share my credentials and high profile projects I&#x27;ve worked on.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with many big fortune500 names, but whenever I apply for frontend jobs it seems like they just don&#x27;t care and I haven&#x27;t gotten a single response to over 10+ applications and different variations of resume.<p>I feel I&#x27;m missing something fundamental because I&#x27;ve had such a great relationship with this client, I&#x27;ve been told I&#x27;m an extremely unique and valued developer, but again I just don&#x27;t get pst sending in my resume and getting rejection emails.<p>What am I doing wrong?",

      "text": "Hi, hoping to benefit from your collective wisdom and experience here.<p>I need to buy a rack-mountable machine (ideally one) that has at least one decent GPU (A6000 or A100), a good CPU (thinking Epyc or Threadripper) and &gt; 40TB of storage.<p>Usage will be all over the place - medium-sized offline (batched) data processing, deep learning with language and visual models, inference, and live data ingestion. Possibly all at the same time.<p>What should I buy? Budget is 20-40k.<p>I&#x27;m wondering in particular:\n- Is the HBM2 memory on an A100 worth the 2x price over a A6000?\n- Should I go for a tower (such as the Lenovo P620) or a 2U rack? (space and power are irrelevant to me)\n- Are there hidden costs with major suppliers (I really don&#x27;t want to pay $1k for a 4TB dell hdd)\n- Are there any gotchas with report to lights out management? I.e. can I remote reboot a threadripper machine?<p>Thanks!",
