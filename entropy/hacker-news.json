Our house is well isolated (we have a heat pump for heating our house), so we have to ventilate a lot.\nDuring evenings we notice we got sleepy very early in the evening. When we go to bed we stay awake for quit some time. This made me wonder if there was a coloration with the candles and us feeling sleepy early, so I bought a CO2 meter.<p>After a few test it became clear that after burning the candles for like 1,5 hours the CO2 level was already 2 to 3 times higher than before the candles burned.<p>Maybe an open door: if you burn a lot of candles or are with a lot of people in a smaller room, don’t forgot to ventilate! This will make you stay awake longer!",
