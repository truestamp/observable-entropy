      "text": "Recently while looking for coding work I connected an LED to my resume site so that I would have instant feedback in the form of a visual notification whenever anyone visited.<p>People seemed to like the idea when I wrote about it on my blog, so I have made this into a free service. Using ESP8266, my own hosted MQTT broker and WordPress plugin. If you want to try it out, I have the instructions over at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ledindicator.devsoft.co.za - see the &quot;learn&quot; page.<p>All you need is a spare ESP8266 module and a WordPress site. I&#x27;m concentrating on WordPress for now, but it should be relatively simple to send MQTT messages from other types of websites.<p>If there is enough interest I plan to do this as a pre-programmed product, with an RGB LED and support for multiple websites. I know you can set this up yourself with Node-Red or Adafruit but I&#x27;m going for a very focused product which does one thing well, and is super simple to set up.",
