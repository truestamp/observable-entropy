      "text": "Does anyone have any advice for managing people&#x27;s career progression (pathways, performance reviews, targets etc.) when they have no interest in progressing?<p>I need &#x2F; am supposed to offer regular career planning with my team, but many of them are quite happy and settled doing what they&#x27;re doing - and I&#x27;m totally cool with that because they do it well and are enjoying their work. They have families, they have lives outside of work, and they want to just get on with the work rather than constantly climbing the ladder or doing performance review documents.<p>I myself am more interested in the work I am doing right now (i.e. building features that deliver more value to the business than the effort&#x2F;time&#x2F;money it takes to build them) rather than constantly planning semi-arbitrary &quot;targets&quot; every 6 months for a promotion I may not even want.<p>So - how do you manage people&#x27;s career planning (including yourself) when they have no interest in progressing? Is it OK to just say, &quot;I&#x27;m happy doing what I&#x27;m doing&quot;?",
