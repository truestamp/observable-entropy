      "text": "As a solo developer of a tiny Saas, I find Vagrant indispensable in my day-to-day tasks. I use it mainly as a tool to reproduce cloud infrastructure locally. As you can imagine, my cloud infrastructure is really tiny and so it&#x27;s feasible to reproduce it locally on my laptop. I also use Docker extensively, but I don&#x27;t think Docker replaces Vagrant at all (at least for my use cases).<p>While I could use a separate private cloud just for development purposes (and effectively use my laptop as a &quot;dumb&quot; terminal), I find it irritating because:<p>- It&#x27;s not free. I have to pay for it<p>- My laptop is powerful enough to emulate my production infra<p>- It just feels wrong to me. I like the idea of using my own machine to develop my application and my infrastructure, and spin up&#x2F;tear down VMs as many times as needed without having to worry about price<p>Do you still use Vagrant or similar tools to spin up VMs locally?",
