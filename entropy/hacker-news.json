      "text": "Hello HN ,\nA bit of Friday morning &quot;productivity&quot;. I decided I needed to track how I am feeling at different times of the day and wrote a 4 line bash function. The idea is to meet the following requirements : \n1. Easy to use and readily accessible\n2. Store in a CSV and push to git so that I can create nice looking graphs later on\n3. Make good use of time on a day I woke up at 5:30AM :)<p>```\n score=$1<p>message=$2<p>echo &quot;$score,$message,`date`&quot; &gt;&gt;mood.csv<p>git commit -am &quot;Mood@`date`&quot; &amp;&amp; git push origin main<p>```",
