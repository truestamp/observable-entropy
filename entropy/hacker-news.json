      "text": "I always thought of a turing machine as a model of a body and it always makes me depressed to think of myself as just a body<p>but recently I come up with this idea to think of a turing machine as a model of a mind, I still not convinced that I am not just a body\nbecause I&#x27;ve seen many bodies doing extra ordinary things but my mind is very boring and it can&#x27;t do anything interesting<p>but a Turing mind is able to do extra ordinary things<p>the definition of a Turing mind is the same as a [Turing machine](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Turing_machine#Formal_definition) with following differences<p>* tape is time\n* symbols are videos ( your visual and auditory field, in the future we can have video formats that can play smell, taste and touch )\n* state is your working memory\n* transition function is your [free] will ( transition function could be mutable )<p>some philosophers have argued that we&#x27;re just a body and mind is an illusion but in this view we&#x27;re just a mind and body is an illusion.<p>a Turing mind is capable of doing all of sci-fi stuff we&#x27;ve seen in movies<p>* we need a computer scientist to tell us that if a mutable transition function could make a difference\n* and a physicist to come up with a physical model of this mathematical model<p>let me know what you think",
