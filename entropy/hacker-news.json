      "text": "Hello all,<p>We recently had a discussion at work about how software decays. That is, if one does not actively work on a piece of software it will eventually fall into ruin. This can happen e.g. because expertise is slowly rotated out of the business, dependencies break or the software can&#x27;t be run on newer operating systems.<p>This begged the question: Is there any software that is essentially done? Where the last commit to the code base was done eons ago and where we expect this software to work for the foreseeable future.<p>The closest thing I can think of is projects that are feature complete. But they still need active patching.<p>Cheers",
