      "text": "Hi HN community,<p>A few friends of mine and I built Tym – a small VS Code extension that makes it easy to share code snippets and get feedback from your teammates.<p>With Tym, you can select a snippet of code and add a question or terminal dump right from the right-click menu. Your teammates can then easily browse your code in a web-based version of VSCode, even if you have uncommitted changes (we make a commit to a hidden git reference in your repo).<p>We made Tym so we don’t have to go to Github and find lines every time we want to share a piece of code. With Tym, you can stay in VS Code and easily share links to your code.<p>Tym is free and all the code is hosted on your Github repository. So only people who have permission to access your repo can see your code snippets.<p>We hope you’ll give it a try and let us know what you think! We’re passionate about improving code collaboration, you can join our discord or follow us on twitter to discuss more!<p>Discord: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;ft8DcsmcjJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;ft8DcsmcjJ</a><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tymcollab\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tymcollab</a>",
