      "text": "Welcome bakc HN, to another round, a couple of years later. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27746587 happened only 10 months ago. Let&#x27;s poll the audience:<p>1) DO_NOT_TRACK or no?<p>2) op? polemicist or avant-garde privacy advocate?<p>3) personal opinion: Almost no one in the original thread mentioned that an app that has opt-out privacy policy defaults would be unlikely to change their practices. And if we read what the op says repeatedly, &quot;opt-out&quot; mechanisms are inherently stupid, then this flag is obsolete. I.e. respectful providers never opt-out privacy tools, and they can always create an &quot;opt-in&quot; flag, which is conceptually and fundamentally not compatible with the &quot;opt-out&quot; flag $DO_NOT_TRACK. The op says &quot;opt-out&quot; is invalid, and then invents the primordial &quot;opt-out&quot; flag, but not one comment can see through this logical inconvenience. HN is fun to poll opinions but in terms of finding vetted thinking its no better than anything else.<p>Everyone wants to rant about how they &quot;would&quot; do something, and people who try &quot;to do&quot; anything are ridiculed, but, between pointing out a simple logical fallacy and psychoanalysing a random poster to the point of determining whether his standards crusade measured up, we lost a debate over opt-in vs opt-out and all opt-out adherents shilled their way through a lost cause of &quot;standards&quot; worshipers.<p>Sad affairs in these late hours.",
