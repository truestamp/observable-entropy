      "text": "I work in IT and made some adjustments to my lifestyle. Here is my weight every Saturday over 18 months. I am surprised at the amount I still consume. Maybe more what, than how much. Main thing I have learned is that diet is about what you eat over a month, not a day. The massive slice of Snickers Cheesecake with ice-cream I had after last night won&#x27;t impact my weight unless I do it regularly.<p>Walk 2.8 miles daily (so Google fit tells me)<p>Don&#x27;t eat much bread, no butter<p>Skimmed milk<p>Porridge and fruit for breakfast<p>Vegetable curry etc for lunch<p>4 or 5 pieces of fruit a day<p>Lots of Coke Zero &#x2F; Diluted juice<p>Dinner - whatever<p>Don&#x27;t eat after dinner",
