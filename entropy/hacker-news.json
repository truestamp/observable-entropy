      "text": "I currently have a Python script I used to notify me whenever my cronjobs fail. My crontab looks like this:<p><pre><code>  0 0 * * * job_monitor.py --to user@email --cmd my_cron_script.sh\n</code></pre>\nThe script is quite useful - it automatically emails any WARN or ERROR messages or cases where exit code is not 0 - but it&#x27;s also sort of janky and feature limited.<p>This feels like it should be a common use-case, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any open source libraries for this. This usually means one of two things: 1. I&#x27;m googling for the wrong thing 2. my approach is somehow wrong.<p>Are there any Python (or otherwise) tools that provide this behaviour?",
