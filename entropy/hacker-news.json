      "text": "I&#x27;ve been building websites for 8 years and I&#x27;ve always hated building forms. They&#x27;re all similar enough to be a repetitive task, but different enough that they still take quite a bit of time and effort. So, after a few years of not finding the tool I wanted, I decided to built it.<p>Introducing Fetch Forms!<p>Developers can create forms with the speed of a form builder and they can use those forms in their code. Devs can use their favorite frontend tools and libraries or even use Fetch Form&#x27;s frontend libraries to render their forms.<p>Form submissions are always provided to the developer in-code as well as an optional setting to save the submissions to Fetch Forms cloud.<p>I would appreciate any feedback!",
