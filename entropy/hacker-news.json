      "text": "I used the vim extension for about a month and am now making what is a very jarring&#x2F;uncomfortable switch to exclusively using vim (neovim technically). I thought I had comfortably got the movements inside a file down, but now that I’m trying to navigate medium&#x2F;large projects, I see how much more I need to learn before I can “break even” and get back to my speed&#x2F;comfort in vscode. I’m finding myself doubting the amount of time I’m dedicating to configuring&#x2F;practicing vim and am seeking insights as to whether or not this is a worthwhile way to spend my time as I don’t really know what the vim endgame looks like, while vscode was definitely good enough.",
