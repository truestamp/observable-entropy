      "text": "dIM Chat is a peer-2-peer chat app for iOS which works without internet but instead uses Bluetooth.<p>I was inspired by the Briar project[1] and wondering why there was no such thing for iOS, so I decided to build one. There are still a few things major things which are WiP such as group messaging. The goal of the project is to allow demonstrants to communicate while the mobile data signal is shut off.<p>Messages are e2ee and the code is Open Source.<p>Try it out on the App Store[2].<p>Any feedback is appreciated.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;briarproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;briarproject.org</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;dk&#x2F;app&#x2F;dim-chat&#x2F;id1583606879\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;dk&#x2F;app&#x2F;dim-chat&#x2F;id1583606879</a>",
