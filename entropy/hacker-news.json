      "text": "Sorry, the usual question... :P<p>This morning I read the post &quot;The Rust Performance Book (2020)&quot; and when I wanted to upvote it 10 hours later I had to go to page #4 (ranked currently #108 with 184 votes &quot;20 hours ago&quot;) =&gt; finding it on page #4 was weird for me (I would have never found that precious post if I would have checked HN only this evening).<p>The usual reply to my kind of question is &quot;click on &#x27;past&#x27; to see a kind-of-better ranking&quot; but after having done that exactly &gt;now&lt; I see for example:<p>- at position #41 &quot;Logo and Learning (2015)&quot; (63 points, 3 days ago, 26 comments) and...<p>- at position #42 &quot;America’s favorite family outings are increasingly out of reach&quot; ( 270 points, 1 day ago, 569 comments) - btw. I read this and for me it wasn&#x27;t great but still interesting, so in the end I liked it, at least 10000 times more than &quot;logo and learning&quot; (which I glanced over).<p>I don&#x27;t like the current ranking :(",

      "text": "After being frustrated with the budget and learning curve requirements of the big names in the Virtual Production field, I decided to create my own all-in-one platform designed with beginners and less-technical folk in mind.\nIt takes complicated tasks in other engines and makes them two-click solutions.  And, with the free companion mobile app, you can track cameras, scan your sets, and (coming soon) do full body motion capture!<p>There&#x27;s a ton more features that I&#x27;m super proud of, and I&#x27;m open to any and all feedback!\nThanks!",
