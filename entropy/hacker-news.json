      "text": "Hey HN,\nDeepmind recently released their alphafold model to let coders &amp; scientists experiment. I looked at the default requirements ,the datasets require 2.2Tb storage, so huge , memory requirements obviously must be higher. Can regular hobbyists experiment with such a model and possibly build a product around it? Or it&#x27;s impossible? How are the costs of running it anyways?",
