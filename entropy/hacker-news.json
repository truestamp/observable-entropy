I enjoy listening to history podcasts, but all I can find now is either about well-known topics (i.e discovery of America) or subtly reflecting the ideological opinions of the host.<p>I want to find something objective and original. The topics don&#x27;t need to be too niche. Do you have any recommendations? Thanks.",

The explanation of a problem solution given by a source often involves a key insight, but there&#x27;s never an explanation of how to reliably come up with key insights!<p>I&#x27;ve looked for tips and tricks, but the answer appears to be either &quot;do thousands of logic and math problems and gain an instinct for it&quot; or &quot;have any extremely high IQ&quot;.<p>Any thoughts?",
