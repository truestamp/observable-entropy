      "text": "I was recently in this dilemma where my grandfather had a stroke &amp; I wanted to be by his side throughout his hospitalization.<p>While my coworkers &amp; boss were extremely supportive of me taking a few days off, I couldn&#x27;t shake the urge to still &quot;check-in&quot; and work whenever I wasn&#x27;t by my grandfather&#x27;s side.<p>I felt the more I was disconnected from work, the harder it was going to be for me when I came back, so I tried to &quot;keep myself afloat&quot; by replying to IMs, emails, and do whatever work I could asynchronously.<p>Everyone I know (including folks I work with) always say we should strive for a work&#x2F;life balance, but I feel like that completely compartmentalizing the two is impossible. Especially if I want to continue to progress my career &amp; not do sub-par work.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just overthinking it, but would love your thoughts on how best to handle this.",
