      "text": "Greetings HNers,<p>I’ve recently picked up a new hobby and have been struggling to find resources for getting started and contextualizing the hobby. Everything jumps into technique whereas I don’t even know the who, what, when, where, why.<p>Im therefore thinking of making a simple FAQ website for this topic. These FAQs would be fairly detailed (more than just question and one sentence answer), but I don’t envision it as an ongoing blog: more just a static page of common questions and resources for someone starting out.<p>Can you suggest any websites that have a well designed “static but verbose FAQ” layout?",
