      "text": "How do you deal with burnout, especially when close to a big deadline &#x2F; release?<p>I&#x27;m a junior dev and have been at a pretty huge company for about a year now. I generally do good work (manager and other team members say as much at least) and I&#x27;m often &#x27;visible&#x27;, having built a good enough reputation among the other teams and leadership in the project to the point where I tend to be one of the main points of contact for my team outside of our technical architect.<p>However this sprint I&#x27;ve been working on two stories (features?) that I absolutely despise working on (involves working with other team&#x27;s microservices that have much spaghetti code and parts of the product I&#x27;ve never worked with before), and the deadline for them was cut super short yesterday by leadership as we&#x27;re close to release. But I am feeling super unmotivated and the mounting pressure isn&#x27;t helping kick my ass to gear. I know that if I continue work on this I&#x27;ll just be phoning it in...<p>Honestly this whole  release has felt like a death march and I&#x27;m just drained.<p>In any case, apologies if this sounds like just a rant but how do you get through the slog of sh*t work and shit deadlines while your battery is drained? Not even thinking about salary and insurance is getting me anywhere. I&#x27;m wondering if this burnout is a symptom of something deeper.",
