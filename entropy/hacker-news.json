      "text": "So its in the news that MicroStrategy took out a huge loan to buy bitcoin and that if the prices falls to ~$21,000 that they would receive a margin call on the loan.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;06&#x2F;15&#x2F;bitcoin-microstrategy-denies-it-received-margin-call-against-silvergate-loan.html<p>So the question is, what is the consequences of this? Will MSTR have to sell some of their bitcoin further fueling the sell-off? Do they just borrow against other collateral? Is this a big deal or a non-event?",
