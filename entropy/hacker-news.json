      "text": "I currently work as a technical lead for a private tech company and I’ve been offered a job at a publicly traded tech company (non-FAANG). I primarily focus on the business systems side (things like back-end billing, etc) and not so much product development. The salary at the new gig is a bit higher and the team seems better and more supportive overall, but the current situation with the stock market is giving me some pause.<p>Is this reasonable? Is there anything I should be considering as part of this move as it relates to the current drop we are seeing among numerous tech companies?",
