(Automatically, no need of manual logging)<p>This will give the founder a complete overview of where&#x27;s the company heading (and possibly a good idea of the efficiency)<p>We&#x27;re looking for first few customers so that we can shape the product according to their feedback.<p>Please comment or upvote to support us.<p>Thanks!",
