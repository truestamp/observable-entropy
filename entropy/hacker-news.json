Lever espresso machines look interesting, but I&#x27;m unsure how they work in practice.<p>- Is the quality actually comparable to a half-decent espresso machine?<p>- Are they as indestructible as they look? I&#x27;d rather not buy something which suffers from metal fatigue in a few months.<p>- Are they as easy to clean as they seem? Having something like three moving parts seems like it should be basically trivial to keep clean, even in an office with tens of users.",
