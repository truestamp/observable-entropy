The existing infrastructure is a React&#x2F;Node&#x2F;GraphQL FE + BE deployed via an ECS container on AWS.<p>We’re looking to make a pivot into a new product with a new infrastructure, and would like to make use of boilerplate as much as possible to focus on the core of what will be the MVP. That means not building from scratch the following elements:\n- Auth\n- Payments\n- Hosting for FE + BE\n- Database<p>We want to continue with our current tech stack on the FE + BE(React&#x2F;Node). I’ve love to know people’s recommendations and what they’ve found to work in the past.",
