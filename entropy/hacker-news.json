      "text": "It seems like internship applications in the US have started for this coming summer. Does anyone know of companies that are taking interns for software development? Also, do companies typically allow college interns to start over winter break or during the semester or do roles only really start in the summer?<p>Looking online itâ€™s easy to find information on internships at huge companies, but the number of applicants is intimidating and many want interns further along in college (juniors and seniors).<p>Thank you.",
