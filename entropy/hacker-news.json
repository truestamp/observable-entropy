I&#x27;d like to get some info on what the day-to-day tasks are like for a developer of something like MongoDB, FoundationDB, CockroachDB, NoSQL alternatives... any type of data store really.<p>Some things in particular I&#x27;m trying to figure out:\n* As with all dev work, a large portion of work is bug hunting, but what kind of bugs do DBs usually have to deal with?<p>* Do developers spend a lot of time on optimization or is this mostly just a concern that&#x27;s figured out during initial development?<p>* What educational prereqs are there? Do employers (strongly) prefer a Masters or even PhD?<p>* How is the job market for this kind of work? Obviously demand is going to be much lower that your standard webdev job, but how is the demand&#x2F;supply imbalance?<p>* What employers hire these developers? Is it basically just FAANG and specialty companies a la Cockroach Labs?<p>Thanks to anyone who takes the time to respond!",
