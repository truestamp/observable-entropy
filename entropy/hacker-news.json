I&#x27;m trying to get myself up to speed to build a pretty complex rails app from scratch, something I&#x27;ve never done before.<p>I&#x27;ve hired someone to help me, we&#x27;ll check in every day and share a screen and and talk over the project and I&#x27;ll get pointers and learn stuff while we work on the same live code together.<p>I&#x27;ve considered something like Cloud9 to host the development instance, deploying to Heroku for production. But Cloud9 is a little clunky of course so wondering if there&#x27;s other options people like for live collaboration on actual code, Google Docs style where you&#x27;re really doing it in real time.",
