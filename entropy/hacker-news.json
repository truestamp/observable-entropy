      "text": "I have been using a ~&#x2F;notes folder with markdown files edited with vim on my computer and markor on my phone synced with syncthing. That works well. But I am also a fan of paper notes and find that they &quot;stick&quot; better in my memory, and I am more conservative and intentional with what I physically write. However I end up with an out of sync feeling - some information stored digitally, some in a notebook. I&#x27;ve been considering strategies to address this.<p>One strategy I thought of is to use a single markdown file like the Hamster system [1] and alphabetize the sections; then I print this file and take handwritten notes onto the print out; then when the diff is large enough, I update the markdown file, print it again, and repeat. The main disadvantage is needing to reprint the full file for what could be small changes. To address that I have considered putting a page return between each letter of the alphabet, so each section starts on a new page.<p>Do you have any strategies to effectively synchronise paper with digital notes?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;slowernews&#x2F;hamster-system",
