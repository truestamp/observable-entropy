Tesla&#x27;s LFP standard range model 3 seems to be around 180 wh&#x2F;kg battery cell density (Pack level is 125 Wh&#x2F;kg), and higher density packs are at 153 wh&#x2F;kg.<p>The truly interesting note in the article is the pack level density &quot;with JTM&quot; of 207 Wh&#x2F;kg, which represents a 65-70% increase over the pack level density of the current LFP model 3.<p>If this is true, that means an SR Model 3 can achieve almost 400 miles range on a pure LFP battery pack, no cobalt or nickel required.<p>Assuming Tesla and Lucid&#x27;s drivetrain efficiency is a temporary lead, this has enormous implications for mainstream auto. LFP should be available in bulk and enable all makers to achieve cheaper-than-ICE drivetrain designs.<p>Current LFP cell designs are also more temperature resistant, can be recharged&#x2F;cycled more times, can be cycled to 100% without degradation, and has far less runaway fire risk.<p>This represents the direct pathway to scaled, cheap, ubiquitous consumer EV transportation, and possibly applications in tractor trailer shipping and container shipping with FleetZero&#x27;s designs.",
