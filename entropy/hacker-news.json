      "text": "Airbnb offers amazing cancellation. I just booked a place for late June of 2022, with cancellation up to 48h before check-in. I&#x27;ve even seen places with cancellation up to 24h before check-in.<p>Why, then, do bots not go book these places systematically and attempt to re-sell them? Or just book to troll Airbnb (and maybe profit some other way—maybe if you are a host you can &quot;book&quot; all the places near you creating artificial demand).<p>Since this happens all the time (Xboxes, PS5, graphics cards for mining), why is this not more widespread with Airbnb?<p>Even with the 1&#x2F;2 payment due at time of booking, the returns on such a nefarious scheme should easily justify the cost of capital.",
