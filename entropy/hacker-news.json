      "text": "How does a start-up, in a mature market, with no discernible tech advantage and very few customers command a billion pound valuation?<p>For example this week Marshmellow, which is an &quot;insurtech&quot;, raised $85 million valuing the company at $1.25 billion.<p>This is interesting as in Britain (where third party car insurance is a legal requirement), online car insurance isn&#x27;t new. I&#x27;ve managed our families car insurance online for at least a decade.<p>We have several big players Admiral, AXA, Direct Line who seem to offer a similar service, regularly innovate products and have millions of policies, compared to Marshmellows 100k.<p>Mashmellow&#x27;s press release makes vague claims about &quot;using a wider set of data points and clever algorithms&quot; which surely any half-decent VC can see right through?<p>I routinely read about these valuations and shrug my shoulder and ask &quot;why?&quot;. Am I too cynical? Should I just shut up, create my own company with a bunch of meaningless buzzwords and become a billionaire founder myself?",
