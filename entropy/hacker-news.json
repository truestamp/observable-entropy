Especially for the free to paid retention rates.<p>I&#x27;ve tried in-app tutorials, email welcome sequences, and trying to arrange calls with customers.<p>Just so I could try to build a relationship so they could ask me questions and I could get them onboarded properly... But none of these was a home run.<p>Then I had the idea to create a way to send personalized thank you videos at scale.<p>Each time a user signs up for your app you get a to-do item to send them a personal video which gets sent to their inbox. The user can then click an email link to a webpage with your video. A new one is recorded each time so your new users each get an ultra-personal email right in their inbox.<p>With everyone being flooded with generic emails (just using their name at the top isn&#x27;t enough) you can really stand out and show your customer that you&#x27;re here for them.<p>Imagine getting a personal thank you from Jeff Bezos every time you sign up for AWS?<p>I think this is a really cool idea. But who knows, let me know what you think<p>BTW I created a landing page to catch any of you that would be interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signup.thankyoureels.com&#x2F;saas&#x2F;beta",
