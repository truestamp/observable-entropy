My solution is to type my HN messages in TextEdit instead, where the problem doesn&#x27;t happen, then cut and paste into HN.<p>I have a 15&#x27; mid-2012 MBP running Catalina (10.15.7) and I have HN open in Chrome 97.0.4692.99.<p>What could be happening that causes all my keys to stop working only in Chrome?",
