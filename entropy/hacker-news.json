      "text": "Hi, \nMy name is Leonardo Locatelli and I work for ADAPTA studio, a recently constituted spinoff of Politecnico di Milano (www.adapta.studio).<p>Recently we developed a cloud service that allows users to optimize 3D assets by reducing the number of polygons directly from your browser but, to build something really useful, we need feedback from experts in 3D modeling and game development. Our team is composed mostly by mathematicians and software engineers so we appreciate feedback from people with complementary competencies.<p>That&#x27;s why we are giving people the possibility to try our software free of charge with some limitations on the number of optimizations everyone can do each month. What we ask is only some feedback and if you want, some suggestions about the main pain points for you in the development of 3D real-time apps.<p>Here is a link to a video detailing its usage: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gfvCdONP9BU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gfvCdONP9BU</a><p>The idea came from an algorithm I and some colleagues developed in our Master thesis (we are mathematical engineers), and we identified polygon reduction with rendering quality preservation as an important application.<p>Our service allows users to create LOD in a simple way with a new patent-pending algorithm that allows extreme polygon reductions preserving quality, normals, soft and hard edges, UVs, rig, skins, and animations.<p>Here is a link to a video showing the possibility to preserve textures and animations: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tTSR_5vsH9o\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tTSR_5vsH9o</a><p>Moreover, you can set presets and use them for multiple LOD creations: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iU4xRAmzpjk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iU4xRAmzpjk</a><p>If you want to try it you just need to follow this link and create a profile, you just need an e-mail address <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amaz3d.adapta.studio&#x2F;auth&#x2F;login\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amaz3d.adapta.studio&#x2F;auth&#x2F;login</a><p>Thanks a lot to anyone who will provide any feedback and for your time! We are adding features over time (the next in line are baking and masking) and would love to hear your ideas on what you’d like to see on this cloud platform.<p>Leonardo Locatelli",
