      "text": "Hi Everyone,\nI&#x27;m Shazeb, and currently working as a penetration tester and I made this pwnremote Jobs website to help people find a remote job in cybersecurity.<p>Problem: \nMy current job is fully remote and, now I want to change the job, but I couldn&#x27;t find any good platforms to find a proper remote job for the cybersecurity.<p>Solution:\nSo, I&#x27;ve created this website(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pwnremote.com) because I’ve seen many people, including myself, Who want to apply for jobs for remote work, but there is no platform for cybersecurity jobs and also, if you google also, there are not many results. That is why now, I’ve created this dedicated place that is only focused on Cyber Security Jobs. We want to protect the internet from anywhere in the world.<p>Also, I know this is not a perfect website, but please be nice and give me a feedback, so i can learn and improve my website.<p>Thanks,\nShazeb",
