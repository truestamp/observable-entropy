I&#x27;d love some kind of framework to apply that will create clarity for them.<p>Or, how has a great manager helped you grow your career?<p>I&#x27;m a people manager and want my employees to advance their careers (typically this means moving up at a current company). I also am extremely busy and have many direct reports, which means I need to find a balance.<p>Currently I provide consistent coaching ad-hoc (reviewing projects) and give feedback as I see it, but it lacks structure. I do a good job of providing them projects where they can stretch themselves and grow into the next level, but when it comes to promotions it feels a bit fuzzy. Maybe concrete milestones would be helpful?<p>It&#x27;s also the case that getting promoted isn&#x27;t as simple as &quot;do 1, 2, and 3&quot;. We have leveling guidelines but they&#x27;re not a checklist.",
