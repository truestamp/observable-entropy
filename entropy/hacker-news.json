      "text": "I was about to read an article about the just completed baseball game between the Yankees and Red Sox, when a snippet from a Google search caught my eye:<p><pre><code>   8 minutes ago · This time Xander Bogaerts and \n   Kyle Schwarber hit dwelling runs off Gerrit \n   Cole, because the Red Sox beat the Yankees, \n   6-2, within the American ...\n</code></pre>\nThe article itself[0] is rife with incorrect usage and really odd use of language.<p>So I wondered, is this an auto-generated article?<p>Upon further reflection, it reads more like something translated from English to a foreign language and then (poorly) auto-translated back to English.<p>The website in question appears to be based in India, but is entirely in English (sort of).<p>Here&#x27;s the first paragraph of the article:<p><pre><code>   BBucky Dent was within the stadium, the \n   calendar stated October, and every staff \n   wanted to win to maintain its season alive. It \n   had been 43 years since Dent’s well-known \n   dwelling run helped the Yankees win the final \n   elimination recreation between these storied \n   rivals at Fenway Park, and almost a half-\n   century later, Boston lastly received a small \n   measure of revenge for that exact recreation.\n</code></pre>\nWhat might compel someone to do that?  To disguise that the work is plagiarized?  Some other reason?  I find it quite mystifying.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;popnews247.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;06&#x2F;yankees-are-done-season-ends-in-a-wild-card-loss-to-the-red-sox&#x2F;",
