      "text": "I bought Lenovo P14s Gen1 around a year ago with intention to use its Nvidia P520 card with external 4K monitor and get decent 4K experience.<p>What was a surprise when I realized that Nvidia card is not wired to any external port. Hence I should either (1) use only integrated Intel video OR (2) render in P520 and copy into Intel card (in practice this is slow). I do not mention even using two 4K monitors.<p>Can you recommend Lenovo laptop with a decent card that renders directly to external video port(s) ?<p>What are opinions about AMD chips and its integrated video card ?",
