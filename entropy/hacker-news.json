      "text": "I&#x27;m trying to design something similar to a qr code from scratch. I&#x27;ve got some ideas on how I can anchor and fill in binary data into the graphic design but I&#x27;m a bit unsure as to how I should approach the reading&#x2F;decoding part (with a camera).<p>Sorry if this isn&#x27;t the right place to ask this.<p>QR codes have been around for a while. I like the way facebook messanger or snapcodes approach the task of human-friendly and machine readable designs, but I&#x27;d like to experiment with something new.<p>It doesn&#x27;t need to encode too much information anyway.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading into AR with unity. I don&#x27;t mind learning some c# but I&#x27;d ideally want to write a solution in python or javascript.<p>Thanks again",
