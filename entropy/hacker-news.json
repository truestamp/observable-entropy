      "text": "I run an API SaaS business, where most use-cases you&#x27;d use our API for involve making a fairly-large number of API requests.<p>For business reasons, we don&#x27;t yet have any paid plans (nor any of the infrastructure to support paid plans); so right now we&#x27;re only giving our users access to a <i>rate-limited</i> free plan.<p>For the vast majority of our users, they can build and scale their use-case while staying well under the rate limits our free plan imposes.<p>But some of our users find our rate-limits constraining, and try to evade them by registering additional accounts, to then use multiple API keys in tandem to make their requests.<p>Deactivating these &quot;tandem&quot; accounts as we find them doesn&#x27;t help much, as these users just move on to using increasingly &quot;stealthy&quot; account registrations — using real-seeming email providers; registering through VPNs to disguise their traffic origin; splitting their workload such that their backend IPs never correlate; etc.<p>We <i>could</i> force users to go through a KYC&#x2F;AML-like identity-verification process to register, but this would be a pretty massive hurdle in the way of signing up for a SaaS product (and not one users would expect, given that we&#x27;re not a finance or gambling app.)<p>Is there any other way? What have other API SaaS business-owners here on HN done to combat this?",
