      "text": "There&#x27;s essentially nothing about Git&#x27;s functionality that is specific to code. Git works with text-based file formats, which are very common outside of software engineering, and supports binary files as well.<p>Yet even highly technical fields like scientific publishing, that already use LaTeX for which Git would be a perfect match and could dramatically improve collaboration, still mostly default to sending versions of documents back and forth by email.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the explanation that Git is somehow too complex. First, there are all kinds of GUI frontends that hide away the intricacies of the commit flow. Second, it&#x27;s not like other fields don&#x27;t already use extremely complex technical tools every day. Git is trivial to use compared to some of the software prevalent in process management and accounting, not to mention civil engineering disciplines. Even Excel is much more complex than Git.<p>So why is Git still being ignored pretty much everywhere outside of software engineering?<p>Or perhaps the better question is: Why does software engineering consider Git indispensable, when every other field, including science and civil engineering, seems to get away without it or any equivalent tool?",
