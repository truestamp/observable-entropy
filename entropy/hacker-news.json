Tearing down a docker instance (Colima delete) and starting a new one (Colima start) takes (less than) a minute and it’s brilliant for local testing. Everything else I tried is supported, mostly Compose with volumes.<p>I’m very inclined to start my own CLI or Chromium based desktop taskbar for Colima (although now back on the commandline enjoying it as much).\nIs there such a project?<p>Thank you Colima creators and contributors. You rock!<p>Colima on github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abiosoft&#x2F;colima",
