      "text": "How to reproduce:<p>1. open the Mail app that comes pre-installed in Windows 10.<p>2. Take a screenshot of an email message where the subject, sender and receiver are visible.<p>3. Try to attach the screenshot to a MS Teams message.<p>4. You will see an error stating that the image could not be uploaded.<p>5. Now take any other screenshot, e.g. a screenshot from Mozilla Thunderbird.<p>6. Attach the Thunderbird screenshot to a MS Teams message<p>7. This time, the screenshot will be attached without errors.<p>So, it seems the best email client to use in conjunction with MS Teams is Thunderbird :-p",
