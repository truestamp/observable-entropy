After this morning&#x27;s upgrade to version 91, I am back to videos on Twitter (and possibly elsewhere) starting to auto-play just by scrolling into view.

In my Twitter profile, I have &quot;Autoplay&quot; set to &quot;Never&quot;, but, I also look at threads without logging in.<p>Do you know what I need to do to be able to look at a Twitter thread while not logged in without triggering autoplay? Unfortunately, I do not remember what I had done previously which made it so that I almost never encountered autoplaying media on any site.",
