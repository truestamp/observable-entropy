      "text": "TLDR: How did you choose your career path and found something that fits you well?<p>I am in early twenties, studying data science at a Master&#x27;s level in europe and I am really uncertain about what I wanna pursue as a career.\nI love data science and the deep learning aspect of it and if I have the opportunity to pursue a pHD on a interesting subject I might consider it. But on the other hand, the market seems to be over-saturated with folks interested in machine learning.<p>I am also really interested in a variety of other fields like game development, backend development, cybersecurity and also have a few project ideas that could lead me to a more entrepreneurial path.<p>One of the problem is that I constantly switch projects and can&#x27;t really stay focus on one thing, I want to do so much that I get lost trying everything out. Thus I do not have very good&#x2F;interesting projects to show to future interviewer.<p>Did you have a similar experience and how did you deal with it?",
