      "text": "Hi all<p>Have tried the below to get macbook pro 16&quot; battery to last longer than 3 hours.<p>For a laptop that is supposed to last 9-11 hours this is way off the mark.<p>List of things that I tried and that failed:<p><pre><code>  1. Turbo Boost Switcher app - turns off CPU turboboost \n  2. Closing onedrive and google drive apps\n  3. gfxcardstatus app - shows you if you using discrete or integrated GPU (integrated better for battery)\n  4. Use without external monitor\n  5. Close all inactive apps\n  6. Only browse with Safari\n  7. System Settings&gt;Energy Saver I checked the box &quot;Automatic Graphics switching&quot;\n  8. System Settings&gt;Bluetooth&gt;Advanced&gt;Uncheck &quot;Allow Bluetooth devices wake this computer&quot;\n  9. System Settings&gt;Notifications&gt;Turn on Do Not Disturb&gt;When Display is sleeping&#x2F;When Screen is locked.\n  10. Reset SMC\n  11. Reset NVRAM &#x2F; PRAM\n  12. Use activity monitor to check battery usage (nothing jumps out at me, and no processes are draining batteries)\n</code></pre>\nDoes anyone have anything that actually works?<p>This is a very common issue all over the internet<p>Thanks.... I can&#x27;t go to the Apple Store in my country there isn&#x27;t one.",
