      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for a phone for a 16yo, who hasn&#x27;t had one before and is interested in it for only two things: language-learning with Duolingo and taking pictures. He&#x27;s a grade-A student across the board, a virtuoso violinist and quite sporty on the side.<p>The favoured option would be a Fairphone 4 for its repairability&#x2F;sustainability and open source creds (he has access to tech-savvy adults), but according to comments I&#x27;ve read here, and in some reviews, the camera is below par. What would you guys recommend? One option would be the Fairphone and a standalone compact digital camera, but I&#x27;m interested in hearing from HN commenters who might recommend an all-in-one option. Trying to avoid iPhones or flagship branded Android equivalents, but cost isn&#x27;t the main factor.<p>Also, re Fairphone, I noticed that the Fairphone 2 came in for quite a bit of negative commentary here [1] a little while ago after an ArsTechnica article was posted about the Fairphone 4&#x27;s five-year warranty and plans for six years of upgrades. Anyone have views specifically on the Fairphone 4, re any (remaining) software problems or other issues?<p>All opinions&#x2F;advice greatly appreciated.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28705196",

      "text": "I&#x27;m still very opposed to the idea of taking a technology and then searching a problem for it. Why? Back in 2017 during the first hype cycle, blockchain companies raised hundreds of millions with ICOs. I became very interested in the technology too, and some friends still work in this space. 4 years later in the web3 era, there is not a single product aside from trading&#x2F;finance that got traction. Use cases like storing the history of a car on chain, transparent supply chains, public voting... this all sounds interesting but never made it to product market fit.\nI always assume that I&#x27;m wrong, so I&#x27;ll keep looking for successful applications :)",
