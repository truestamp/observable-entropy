      "text": "I hate to even talk about this but with all the bad news recently about the stock market downturn esp the NASDAQ, hiring freezes, rising interest rates, along with all the other negativity like Russia&#x27;s war, continuing lock-downs in China with no end in sight and sky high oil prices all contributing to inflation, it seems like a recession might be inevitable at this point.<p>I am no economist but it is esp concerning to me that with particular recession due to inflation there don&#x27;t seem to be any &quot;easy&quot; option like Quantitative Easing available to get out of it fast so I fear that this might a painful one which is adding to my anxiety. How worried are you and what are you doing to handle it? Is there a chance it could be as bad as 2008 or worse 2000? (I was not in the professional job market during those years so I have no idea how bad they were other than knowing they were real bad).",
