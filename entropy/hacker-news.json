      "text": "Hi fellow builders,<p>I&#x27;ve been working in digital marketing for 15+ years and reporting Instagram analytics has always been a serious embarrassment when it came to present meaningful ROI-driven results other than followers, likes and comments ...<p>Things got a little better when Instagram introduced its business tools back in 2007-8. Yet, Instagram &quot;business insights&quot; are pretty &quot;light&quot; to say the least and very vanity-driven.<p>Plus, the level of complexity and requirements to unlock all Instagram&#x27;s metrics from Meta&#x27;s APIs is ridiculous.<p>There are analytics softwares and apps doing a better job. Still, they cost around $29 or $49 per month (and way more!). Creators need these analytics to grow better and they may wanna spend this money on equipment and gear rather than an .<p>That&#x27;s why we built ABSOLUTE CREATORS with my friend Damiano.<p>The required setup is to have an Instagram business account connected to a Facebook business page (sic).<p>Ideal for:\n- in-house marketing teams, brand and social media managers\n- marketing agencies\n- eCommerce shop&#x2F;DNVB owners (especially Shopify)\n- SaaS startups\n- SMB owners\n- Creator economy at large<p>Look it up on the App Store. Thanks for reading!",
