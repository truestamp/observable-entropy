      "text": "Go+ language for engineering, STEM education, and data science\nGo+ officially released version 1.0 on October 15, 2021. Go+ developed by Qiniuyun CEO Xu Shiwei. There are many new contents have been updated in this version, including to faces Three areas, like the slogan of Go+: The Go+ language for engineering, STEM education, and data science.\nGo+&#x27; s vision is 3-in-1, which integrates Go in engineering development, Python in data science and Scratch in programming teaching, and combines the heart of Go in the form of Python, so that the threshold for beginners to learn programming and develop works is lower, and engineers do not need to learn a new development language to process data<p>•       Engineering\n-       Working in the simplest language that can be mastered by children\n•       STEM education\n-       Studying an engineering language that can be used to work in the future\n•       Data science\n-       Communicating with engineers in the same language<p>The Features and Advantages of Go+:\n1.Strong compatibility, inherit the community ecology: The success of Go largely owes to its compatibility with C; Go+ adopts the same strategy, which is grammatically compatible and engine capacity with Go, design&#x2F;compatible with Scratch. In the future, it will support direct import python packages.\n2.Simple, easy-to-learn and easy-to-use: In static languages, Go is known for its simplicity and low threshold, Go+ is easier to learn and use than Go. Go+ conceals the complexity of engineering, and the grammar is more closer to natural language, which can be easily mastered by children for 7 or 8 years old.\n3.Integration of engineering and STEM education: If you choose to learn Go+, you can directly use it for creation and work without switching languages. But if you choose to learn Scratch, you need to switch to another programming language when creating and working.\n4.Better performance and more vitality: Script language is the product of a specific time, and static language is more vital in the long run. Python, as a scripting language, has relatively limited performance. As a static programming language, Go+ is naturally more powerful than Python, with higher efficiency in data processing and bigger potential in development.<p>Here is the link of Go+ @Github：https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;goplus&#x2F;gop\nGo+ Together !",
