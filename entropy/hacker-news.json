I am only 22 and the other job is pretty well paying so I am not in a bad financial situation, this is just an ego&#x2F;confidence hit to me as in it really hurts deep inside to get fired and makes me think if software dev (especially in startups) is what I should be doing? The fact of telling my SO&#x2F;family about it even makes me shake, even though its really no big deal. I always have this pressure of being best at what I do.",
