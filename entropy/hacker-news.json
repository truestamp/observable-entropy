      "text": "Hey HN!<p>I just want to share my weekend project. So a couple days ago I read an article here about Quadratic Voting, and I&#x27;m really interested to implement it myself. After some browsing I found only a couple other poling websites which used QV, but I found that their interfaces less intuitive. So I created https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puaspoll.com . Its very simple, but I think it could be a fresh approach compared to many similar polling website&#x2F;apps. Let me know what you think!<p>Best regards",
