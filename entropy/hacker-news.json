I understand this was the case when the only export format was a CSV file, but now with JSON files I can&#x27;t get my head around the fact that I almost missed crucial SSH keys had I not checked the output. A simple solution would be to b64 encode each file and add it into an array!<p>It&#x27;s even mentioned on their Help page - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitwarden.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;export-your-data&#x2F; but I still think it&#x27;s a bit unacceptable that there isn&#x27;t even a warning in the GUI about this.<p>And yes, I know there are ways to manually export the files, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.",
