However, my big problem is that I have to read from a screen which means I need to be either in front of my laptop or on my phone, neither of which I find particularly enjoyable for study.<p>Do you have any hacks to read books &#x2F; ebooks &#x2F; pdf &#x2F; blog posts effectively that makes it feel like you&#x27;re not looking at a screen all the time? Is there any technology out there than solves this problem?<p>Thanks!",
