      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I have been writing a technical book. It&#x27;s similar to Clean Code, but a little broader as it places a larger emphasis on systems over programs.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the last two years on the book, after being forced to change my typical outdoor fishing&#x2F;trekking&#x2F;hunting lifestyle due to COVID, mostly as a means to keep my sanity. As a very slow writer, I generally write about a page a day. At this rate, it will take me another year to feel the book has reached &#x27;completion&#x27;.<p>With restrictions in my state being lifted, my partner is less and less a fan of me working on the book for long hours at home (chuckle), and I have no good answer to the question of &quot;will anyone even buy this?&quot;.<p>Has anyone here had success selling a technical book like this? Was it lucrative? I&#x27;m not hurting for money, but it helps me answer some questions both for myself and my partner.",
