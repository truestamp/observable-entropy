      "text": "Researching UX to find out if the discipline gets too much hype. \nIt seems that the tech community accepts certain dogma written in the literature: &quot;MVP, agile, user centered design, etc&quot;, but after reading several books you will realize almost none of them contain specific and concrete examples, only generalities.<p>It does not help that Apple keeps its process secret and the few articles on google were either outdated (Job&#x27;s legacy) or blog opinions and speculations. The few UX researchers on Linkedin were contractors, with some roles opening recently in Austin.<p>It bears the question: why does the tech industry follow UX principles that keep pumping mainly low quality products while Apple is the opposite? What are they doing right that most tech companies miss? Or is it not design, but a distinctive leadership style that works?<p>Would love to hear from insiders if possible, thanks.",
