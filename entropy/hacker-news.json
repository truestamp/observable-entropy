      "text": "See see this sentiment a lot.<p>For some context: I use Obsidian for maintaining my zettelkasten, and feel fairly proficient in basic Markdown writing. I enjoy it, and I can see some of the benefits to having this as the base for a document. However, I often see people causally referring to Markdown as a faster way to type, or somehow more efficient way of writing than WYSIWYG. I&#x27;m confused by this.<p>The argument I see online is that writing platforms like Google Docs, etc. require you to use your mouse. But, for the vast majority of formatting that takes place in writing (bold, italics, M-dashes, etc), these are all keyboard shortcut commands. And, to achieve these in Markdown, which in many cases you can use the same commands (ie command + B for bold) the pure markdown approach of asterisks, underscores, etc seem waaaaay more clunky. Not to mention Obsidian&#x27;s weird autofill on () and &quot;&quot; where God forbid you want to go back and add either, you&#x27;re left with deleting excess autofills and the like.<p>So, what am I missing. I trust the sentiment of faster and more convenient is true. But, I&#x27;m just not seeing how. Can ya help me understand?",
