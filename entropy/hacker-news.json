      "text": "There have been dozens of articles coming out over the past several years detailing how Medium is no longer a great home for the aspiring writer&#x2F;blogger (largest of reasons is due to their paywall). I fully agree with this.<p>I used to be an occasional blogger, but had some okay traffic (a few posts took off), but definitely not a name for myself where I could take people with me to my own site. What I liked about Medium was their discoverability, shifting to my blog I believe will lose that discoverability.<p>Are there other platforms or other ways to get organic readership?",
