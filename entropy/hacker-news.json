I didnt want to use electron or other non native frameworks.<p>Most importantly I just wanted it to know how much a certain instance costs right now, no matter its state, its type, its lifecycle(like ondemand or spot) and the costs associated with the EBS volumes attached including their IOPS&#x2F;throughput and etc.<p>It also has a S3 object browser, and a drag and drop UI to upload your files so that you can make S3 your own personal dropbox.<p>I dont track or store anything, you just query the aws api.<p>Sorry its a paid app, if anyone wants to try it and cant afford it let me know, I can send it to you. I think this can be useful and cost saving for individuals that spend more than 50usd per month on aws.",
