We can get by with VSCode doing livereload on a single machine or liveshare on multiple machines, but not both because Univ IT blocks liveshare&#x27;s public port broadcast. Teaching them Git would burn 1-2 class sessions, but might be worth it -- not sure.<p>Is there a way to satisfy these reqs?<p>1. Provides live-sharing (2+ students code from separate machines in the same file)<p>2. Supports auto-reload on each machine without public port binding (Univ IT blocks port broadcast)<p>3. Is an IDE or IDE extension<p>4. Keeps some sort of version history<p>5. Syncs a local copy of the files on each machine* (nice to have)",
