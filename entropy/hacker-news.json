The reason given was:\n&quot;Your website&#x2F;app does not meet our content standards. The content of your website is insufficient. Here you can find an example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fahrrad-tools.de&#x2F;&quot;<p>Do you have an idea what they might be missing? Or could it be an automated website analyzer (AI) that expects a blog-like website?<p>Thanks for your ideas.",
