      "text": "The @ Sign Company launches a new app (@mospherePro) where you decide who, when, and what\ninformation you share.  A cross-platform app, where file-sharing is free, easy, and most importantly,<p>truly secure.<p>@mospherePRo is especially effective for business, allowing for secure transfer of sensitive documents and\nfiles.  No third party, including The @ Sign Company, can ever see your data without your permission!\nYou will be communicating through an @sign, which is a secure and private data capsule that houses the @sign\nowner’s data. All data on this capsule is personally encrypted on the device; the only key able to decrypt the\ndata is created exclusively for the owner as a part of the initial @sign onboarding process.  Since we do not\nhave access to your personal keys, we are unable to access your data.  In short, true end-to-end encryption is\nencryption with no loopholes.  When sending data, only the @sign owner and the @sign chosen to receive the\ndata can see it.\nHow is it different than everything else on the market?\nWell, the @mospherePro app is a privacy-first, file transfer app using true end-to-end encryption. It’s entirely\ndifferent from other file-sharing apps or services because you own the encryption keys!\nOther file-sharing services route files from the sender to their servers and then on to the recipient. And because\nthe service provider has access to the encryption keys, they can access your transferred files—and so can\nhackers! With @mospherePro you are protected because you hold the encryption keys and your files are not\nstored on a server.\nSo where do the files go?\nTransferred files are temporarily stored in an encrypted cache until the recipient retrieves them. In the unlikely\nevent that someone were to access the files without permission, they would not be able to read them without the\nkeys. Even the app creators cannot view sent files.\nOnly on mobile devices?  Or is it also available on desktop?\nWe offer the same secure file transfer system for desktop, too!\nAs a developer, how can I use the technology?\nThe @ Sign Company is created as an open-source project for developers to build their own apps and contribute\nto the existing @platform.  Developers may download, modify and repurpose.\nGithub repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;atsign-foundation&#x2F;atmosphere_pro",
