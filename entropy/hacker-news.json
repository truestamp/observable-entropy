      "text": "Centralized marketplaces often tend to optimize the profits of the corporation running it rather than the experience of the buyers &amp; sellers participating in the network. Can new decentralized marketplaces be created using blockchain technologies, especially for digital services that do not have huge offline logistics? Can decentralized networks connecting cab drivers and commuters, educators and students, artists and audience, etc. solve the trust issues better than traditional web2.0 companies?",

In a nutshell, it documents how Cambridge Analytica-like companies in the US targets christian communities and leverages their data (without their knowledge) to influence their vote. They literally push churchgoers towards more radical positions, all cleverly funded by politically connected organizations.<p>You can read a short review of the docu in The Guardian [1] if you want a slightly longer take on it.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tv.nrk.no&#x2F;se?v=KOID28002519 (free to watch in Norway, restricted to Norwegian IPs)<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;film&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;28&#x2F;people-you-may-know-review-data-mining-christian-fundamentalism-documentary",
