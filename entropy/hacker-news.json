      "text": "It’s always on my list to give back to the community &#x2F; broader society. But I often put it off or feel like I am not doing enough. The easiest way is to financially support some charities or even OSS &#x2F; FSF projects, but while I do that to a minor amount, it feels not enough and also feels like a tax vs a genuine effort to give back. It’s very easy to get caught up in a busy day or week and then this becomes out of sight and out of mind.<p>Other things I was thinking was mentoring or providing knowledge to others.<p>I would be very grateful and keen to hear of ideas of how to give back both financially and also non financially?",
