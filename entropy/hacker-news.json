      "text": "I live most of the time inside JetBrains IDEs. I occasionally edit random files, mainly in terminal using Vim. I also write a blog (with different tools, mainly Obsidian and Typora). In Firefox and Chrome, I use Vimium for years.<p>Recently, I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t really master any editing shortcuts. I&#x27;m able to navigate char by char, word by word, end and beginning of the line, as well as selecting text. But nothing more complex.<p>For any complex file editing, I resort to mouse. I know that JetBrains have tons of shortcuts to help with text editing, Vim has its own as well as Emacs.<p>Few years ago, I&#x27;ve switched to 60% keyboard (so my arrow keys are on CapsLock+ijkl) and I feel like my typing speed did increase. I&#x27;m looking to make a similar improvement in regards to text editing and I&#x27;m wondering what should I invest it.<p>I know that Emacs shortcuts are pretty much universally supported. You can get them in MacOS and JetBrains, you get the in the terminal, and obviously in Emacs (which I used 2 maybe 3 times in my life).<p>Vim gets more love (from what I see) compared to Emacs, and you can get IdeaVim or even terminal navigation with Vim.<p>And I feel like mastering JetBrains shortcuts will help with text editing, but only in JetBrains tools.<p>I&#x27;m leaning towards trying to master Vim, but wondering if Emacs might be more useful, since I also write non code related text and use mainly MacOS (which as far as I know, honors most Emacs shortcuts). Mastering JetBrains shortcuts feel the least appealing to me, since I can&#x27;t transfer that knowledge to other programs.<p>What are your opinions?",
