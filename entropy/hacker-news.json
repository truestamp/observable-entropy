      "text": "Thanks for checking out wabi!<p>wabi finds you a wellness professional based on your needs. Whether you need a trainer, a nutritionist, or a coach, we search for the best fit for you at least 30% cheaper than what you are used to finding.<p>We are 3 Colombians that have lived in the US and found it really hard to access wellness professionals, like a personal trainer or a psychologist, because their prices were very expensive for us. As founders and builders, we find it vital to take care of our mental and physical health to be at our max potential, so affordable access to these services is a must-have. We also found that some of our peers, mostly Latinos, hired these services from professionals based in Latam. Their services are high-quality and the prices are way lower than what we found while living abroad.<p>In our landing, you’ll find a couple of professionals we have personally worked with and highly recommend. If you want to connect with them, just text us. If you don’t find what you want, also just text us with what you are looking for and we’ll get back to you with other professionals.<p>Feel encouraged to give us your feedback, experiences, questions, etc. Every comment is very well received.",
