We will watch evolution in action, but have to shutdown more or less to prevent waves of people hitting hospitals all at once.<p>So basically COVID is here for years to come.<p>And we (yes, privileged knowledge workers with nice jobs) have to adjust.<p>For about the first six months I still had good relationships with all the people I used to meet every day in physical real life.  And I felt comfortable reaching out and asking things on their expertise and <i>what they were working on</i>.  But as time goes on they move, what they are doing changes and I don&#x27;t get to keep up. Two years later and I have great relationships with those I work directly with but barely understand what anyone else is doing.<p>Fixing this should be a top priority of every company- but in the meantime what are we individually doing?<p>Any ideas?",
