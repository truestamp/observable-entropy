      "text": "I was recently approached by a large tech company about a position they were trying to fill. The first step in the interview process was to complete a timed LeetCode-style coding test. I took a look at some sample exercises and these really aren&#x27;t the kind of problems I work on day-to-day.<p>For context I&#x27;m a software architect with over 25 years experience building software and most of my time is spent coordinating, influencing and ensuring we&#x27;re building the right thing. The position I was asked to interview for was a similarly senior position.<p>So my question is...do companies genuinely find these sorts of coding tests a valuabke filter in their interview process?",
