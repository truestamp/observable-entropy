      "text": "In light of recent events, I think I am going to propose a motion, probably at our next upcoming meeting, about council communication expectations.<p>This thing where people say &quot;Please don&#x27;t speak to me again except through Renee&quot; is hampering our ability to do business. As elected councilmembers, it is our responsibility to be available to communication from both residents, owners, and other councilmembers. If we&#x27;re not, it becomes impossible to do our jobs.<p>Cooling off periods are necessary sometimes. Having a third party witness for a conversation that might get heated is also a good idea. Having emotionally loaded conversations via email or text is nearly always a bad idea. Acknowledging all these realities, I suggest the following, which is of course open to amendments.<p>First, the private emails chiding someone for their conduct in a meeting should not happen, ever. Such complaints should be added to the agenda and aired in front of everyone. The emails that I saw last night, reprimanding Alexa and Sarah, were inappropriate.<p>There was a strong implication that the author was speaking on behalf of council, or at least on behalf of Karin, when that was definitely not the case.<p>Second, the emails where someone publicly asks another councilmember not to speak to them again except through a third party are very confrontational. I understand the shock of finding an angry email in your inbox and the desire to prevent that from happening. But these &quot;don&#x27;t talk to me again&quot; broadcast emails seem to be weaponized. I don&#x27;t think we should do that anymore. We don&#x27;t have a higher authority to appeal to. Renee is not our mom, she is our employee.<p>Instead, I suggest this phrasing.<p>&quot;The current conversation is becoming too heated for email. Can we meet in person with another councilmember present?&quot;<p>I suggest ending the email at the point, and resisting the temptation to add more personal attacks or digs.<p>If each party cannot, in good faith, meet face to face and have a genuine conversation to work through their problems, then I respectfully suggest that they are not temperamentally suited to this role, and should withdraw from council. I don&#x27;t say this lightly - council is a lot of work and it&#x27;s hard to get volunteers, and we all worry that no one else will step up if one of us steps down.<p>Even so, it&#x27;s not worth it to anyone&#x27;s mental health to stay in a relationship or role where they can&#x27;t function and communicate with their team.",
