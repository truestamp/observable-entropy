      "text": "3by3 is a fun side project, I built over a weekend during one of the Pandemic&#x27;s lockdowns. For some reason, it remained just that - a side project. I like it, maybe others will do too.<p>Built using Svelte on the frontend, Go on the backend, and PostgreSQL for storage. Hosted on Netlify.<p>Below is the official About of the project:<p>3by3 is a fun way of discovering podcasts by answering three simple questions. It grew out of my desire to introduce the magic of podcasting to more people. The podcasting space exploded over the last few years. There is now more content for every taste than ever before. And yet, finding one&#x27;s way in the ocean of audio remained just as difficult.<p>Rather than going for popular choices, I built 3by3 with the idea of getting to know you, the listener, better. Answering three simple questions is enough to give 3by3 an idea of what you would love to listen to. Not a perfect match? Start over, and you will get a new set in a few seconds. Come back as often as you would like. We are constantly adding more questions and podcasts to our database. We are sure that your matches will become better and better over time.",
