I can manually check every incident to see if there is any correlation between those events, but you know... this takes ages.<p>Do you have any other suggestions? I need the company name, threat (type) action, timeline, and which companies are impacted (the breach propagated).<p>Such that target breach  propagated to companies x, y, and z in 2013 .",
