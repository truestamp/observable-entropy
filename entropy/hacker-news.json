I&#x27;m sure there are many great angels&#x2F;VCs on HN that could potentially see this.<p>Please state what sectors you invest in and at what stage (check size and global&#x2F;US only could be helpful).",

      "text": "I recently added a Segments feature to the Hangtime mountain biking app for Android and IOS.  If you are familiar with Strava’s segments, this new feature works much the same.  For example, you can add a segment to an existing recorded ride by simply defining a start and end point for the segment. Once the segment is created, it will match any new rides, and optionally “back match” all previous rides. If a segment matches a ride, you you will see your time to complete that segment as well as your personal record (PR) and king of the mountain (KOM) for that segment. The KOM represents the best segment time amongst all riders that have matched that segment. You can also open the segment to see your complete history on that segment to gauge how your performance has changed over time.  Some screenshots and videos as well as other features at the link below.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtbx.bike?page=hangtime\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtbx.bike?page=hangtime</a>",
