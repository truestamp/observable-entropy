      "text": "I&#x27;m hiring for some technical positions, and noticed that I&#x27;m getting a lot of resumes that link to a GitHub profile with a common set of characteristics:<p>- A long README.md with lots of awards&#x2F;stats images.<p>- Lots of repositories with single commits, no real explanations in the READMEs. Sometimes these are non-fork copies of more popular projects, which seems even more suspicious.<p>- Most of the repos have five to ten stars each, but if you open them up they are basically the same people over and over starring all the repos.<p>I don&#x27;t want to share links to example profiles because these may be real people, and maybe there&#x27;s some legitimate scenario where profiles look like this that I&#x27;m just not thinking of? It seems though like it&#x27;s just pumping fake data to drive the stats in the readme.<p>The resumes that come along with the profiles seem normal enough, so I wanted to ask here if it&#x27;s something that others are seeing as well? And if it&#x27;s a red flag, as I assume at this point? I&#x27;m asking because I don&#x27;t want to write people off if there&#x27;s something benign happening here that I am just not familiar with.",
