      "text": "Hey folks,<p>I&#x27;m working in a small company located in Europe, which has a business model that extends existing development teams of other companies with a minor number of local developers and a much higher number of remote developers (different contintent). Pre-Covid-era we noticed twice that remote developers tend to work full-time in two (or even more) jobs, which was affecting the work done together with us quite a lot.<p>Now with the pandemic bringing remote working to a much broader acceptance rate it seems that the issue of multiple jobs is rising. Recently I&#x27;ve read an article about 37% of remote people in U.S. are working two full-time jobs. From our experience the number also rose quite a lot in our remote developer employee market - generally spoken. We don&#x27;t have exact numbers for our employees yet.<p>And this leads me to my question(s): How do you deal with such a situation?<p>First of all, I&#x27;d like to figure out how we can identify someone working more than we are aware of. Generally it would be fine for me (&#x2F;us) what people do in their non-work time, but if it affects our work, then it&#x27;s not acceptable. So how can we identify such a situation?<p>Secondly if one has figured out that someone is working additionally at other jobs, how should one handle that? From a contract perspective, we would (&#x2F;could) need to fire that someone the next day, but from a business model and general work perspective we can&#x27;t easily compensate if someone leaves from one day to another.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to your experiences and ideas.",
