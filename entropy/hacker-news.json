I’ve managed to scale the app pretty successfully until now but I feel like I’m am constantly stressed thinking about the next phase. I handle all things technical while the VP of engineering handles the people and process aspects of the team. Lately I have been thinking about stepping down and letting a better CTO come in and run things in the hope that I will be happier day to day. Have you done something similar to this and if so what was the outcome? Were you happier in your personal life?",
