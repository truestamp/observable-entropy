      "text": "tl;dr - I built a fast and low-frills notepad which helps me keep a flow state.<p>I spend a lot of time in the browser: in calls, managing stuff between SaaS apps, or consolidating info from multiple tabs. Usually, I&#x27;d bring up an editor and side-by-side it, or switch between my current tab and a notion tab. This extension lets you hit a hotkey and bring up a notepad in-place. It&#x27;s a scratchpad for thinking in the moment - key points and questions as I&#x27;m working. If I want to hold on to the memory, I can export it to another app - if not, I&#x27;ll just delete the note. It&#x27;s kind of like the RAM to Notion&#x27;s hard drive.<p>A couple more details:\n- It works in videos, pdfs, and most sites. Startup friends use it reviewing their Figmas. Investor friends have been using it on Docsends. I use it to pull important parts from documentation, and writing call notes. \n- A note can be used across tabs (e.g. I&#x27;ve used it to cross-reference product reviews)\n- It keeps a bibliography for each note. \n- It can stash its notes if you want to keep things in-house. If not, you can export to Google Docs and Notion\n- If you connect your Google Drive, you can search your drive. It&#x27;s faster than the web interface.<p>Anyway, the point is to be a really fast way to manage your current thoughts. I feel like memory decays rapidly, and the faster I can record things, the lower my mental burden.<p>I&#x27;ve got a video showing some of this at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getjotter.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getjotter.com&#x2F;</a>. There&#x27;s no signup needed to try it, and I&#x27;m happy to take feedback and suggestions!",
