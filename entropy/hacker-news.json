I’ve already been moderately depressed so this just makes that worse. I haven’t even texted her, been trying to just move on and forget but it’s hard.<p>It sucks too because i really just want to talk to my dad because he always knew how to help me and what to say, but he passed three or four years ago so i feel very Alone.<p>I know it’s better to just move forward, should i block her on everything and just really quit social media? Should i just start grinding code and learning more? It’s sucks because i was trying to build for my portfolio to find and internship for next summer but i keep getting hit with hardships this summer that are making it hard for me to motivate myself. I guess if there’s anyone out there that read this and been in similar shoes, what is my best course of action",
