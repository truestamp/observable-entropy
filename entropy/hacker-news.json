      "text": "We launched Pidgeon a few weeks ago, and since then we&#x27;ve had a chance to fix a lot of bugs and upgrade the usability a significant amount.<p>The app is made just for photo sharing. No videos, no NFTs, just pictures, comments, and chats. Each post is ranked like on reddit - a combination of the user upvote&#x2F;downvotes and the amount of time passed since the post&#x27;s creation.<p>We&#x27;re also trying to stay away from ads, and instead adopt a freemium model. The main reason for this is because people are a lot more concerned with privacy these days, and if we aren&#x27;t serving ads, then the user knows that we don&#x27;t have an incentive to steal their data.<p>There&#x27;s already a small community of about 1500 on the app, with a lot of them being professional photographers. So the photos going up look really nice (at least in my opinion). But we don&#x27;t just want to be a community of people who consider themselves photographers - that&#x27;s a mistake that other platforms like Flickr and VSCO make. To become widespread, you need to make your platform simple to use for the casual person; only catering to professionals will necessarily keep your community smaller than it otherwise would be.<p>Users have been asking for a desktop client, and while we don&#x27;t have one yet, we do plan to add it - and it won&#x27;t take us as long as IG to do it, and neither will it be an afterthought where the UX is intentionally made poor so that you&#x27;re pushed to use the app instead. But we want to polish the mobile app first before we get there, and there&#x27;s still a lot of work to do since it&#x27;s super early days.<p>If you want to try it out, here&#x27;s the link:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=app.pidgeon.pidgeon<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;pidgeon-simple-photo-sharing&#x2F;id1605784768<p>And please do provide any feedback you have on the app! It really does help us make it better.",
