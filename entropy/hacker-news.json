      "text": "I am trying to figure out a solution to taking quick notes that may be disorganized and&#x2F;or incorrect while learning some new technical material.<p>I thought I saw a post here recently that could be used for searching old notes and viewing a graph of connected notes. I cannot find it.<p>Many things I do are set-up once, but never revisited or changed for long periods of time.  Then, I have to re-google and learn again.  Often with out-dated documentation.<p>For instance, I am currently working towards a cluster setup for containers and various apps.  I do not have a particular end-goal.  I am trying to expand my knowledge and and will be rebuilding as I break things.<p>Since I am learning, I am copy&#x2F;pasting a lot and have many disjointed tasks as I progress.  Many of the guides&#x2F;tutorials have out-dated information which I then have to note again.<p>I would like to jot down notes&#x2F;commands and then come back to organize into actual procedures once I have things implemented properly.<p>An example that came today was the need to add a secondary interface to Ubuntu for a VLAN.  I may never revisit this for years, but will need to repeat it sometime.<p>It would be nice to be able to reference this VLAN procedure&#x2F;notes and in-line them to a task note that was initially unrelated.  I may have forgotten that I ever made the notes in the first place and then duplicate it again.<p>Right now, I am not building documentation, but noting things I am not sure are even correct yet that may end up as documentation.<p>Almost like I need a tagging&#x2F;searchable&#x2F;dated system but I don&#x27;t know what the tags would be yet.",
