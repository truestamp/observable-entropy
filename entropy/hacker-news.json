What have you been curious about and thought, &quot;I wonder what would happen if you ran a study on this...&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s a couple examples:<p>- What numbers are people least&#x2F;most likely to notice missing in an ordered list of numbers? E.g. If you ask people to quickly scan the list [60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69], which element when taken out would have the highest&#x2F;lowest % of people who respond that there are no missing elements? Is it numbers that end in 7? Maybe people always notice when numbers with repeated digits are missed (66).<p>-",
