      "text": "I&#x27;ve heard a lot of advice for founders to build a landing page as an MVP in order to collect e-mail addresses and validate an idea. But I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more to the process than this. If I&#x27;m trying to build a consumer product, how should I go about sharing it? How many e-mails do I need before it&#x27;s validated? What do you do once you have those e-mails?<p>These are just some of the thoughts and questions I had. I&#x27;m skeptical that a landing page alone can do much since it isn&#x27;t really solving a problem for the user.",
