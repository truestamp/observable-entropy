      "text": "It seems that my experience in the Android ecosystem only deteriorates over time. I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Watch and everything is just too messy. I can&#x27;t add my bank card to Samsung Pay, battery sucks, I have trouble connecting with my Google account, Google Assistant is still not available, blood pressure and ECG is only available with a Samsung phone, etc. I know there are many hacks, but I honestly don&#x27;t have the patience for it. My phone is a Poco X3 and most things work fine, except third party apps. Everything is some poor port of a web app that rarely works. Settings are also extremely complicated and convoluted. And there is more: in the past years I have been losing more and more of my trust in Google. I see myself getting worried if all my data will simply be lost in the next day and there will be nothing I can do about it. Been wondering if it would be worth it saving up a lot and do a full migration to the Apple ecosystem, with and iPhone, Apple Watch, Macbook and their cloud stuff.",
