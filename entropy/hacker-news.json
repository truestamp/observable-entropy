      "text": "Hi HN, I write code and unit tests for my other departments in my company. For me, writing code in a programming language feels natural, so I like to use the notation of the language itself. A colleague likes to write code more like prose so someone from another (non-IT) department should be able to read it. How do you deal with this in your company?\nI think I read an article about this a few days ago, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore. Does someone still remember this?",
