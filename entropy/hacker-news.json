Decent idea, people are using it for a megadownvote.<p>Recently though I&#x27;ve noticed it went missing, I figured I&#x27;d used it too much or in a way someone under the hood didn&#x27;t like<p>Even more recently I&#x27;ve noticed I can vouch-res dead comments -- as in not flagged, the user deleted the comment. Unvouching leaves the comment in an un-[dead] state. For what it&#x27;s worth I didn&#x27;t do this on purpose, just mis-tapped the tiny text on mobile.<p>I also noted that by vouching a comment that is both flagged and dead it removes the flagged state, if you then unvouch, it leaves it just dead and loses the flagged tag<p>Is it working properly? My hunch is that it&#x27;s been attached to `if ([dead])` instead of `if ([dead] &amp;&amp; [flagged])` somewhere, but I have no real idea.<p>Do I just not understand it?",
