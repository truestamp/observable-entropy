      "text": "One sentiment from the recent Roe v Wade decision is that women should be careful about their data as law enforcement could use it to determine if they had an abortion.<p>Period tracker apps are quite popular, and even a form of contraception [1]. They technically don&#x27;t need to access the data (although they may wish to for analytics&#x2F;monetisation), so it seems to me like a perfect candidate for E2E encryption. But I can&#x27;t find any that advertise they use E2E encryption (just a vague &quot;we encrypt your data&quot; in their privacy statement).<p>Is anyone working on this?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.naturalcycles.com<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a man, and I don&#x27;t live in the US. My wife and I are just concerned onlookers.",
