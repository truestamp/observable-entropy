      "text": "In the move away from proprietary services on the Android Platform many have experienced difficulties with the SafetyNet mechanism, especially regarding certain banking apps.<p>As there aren&#x27;t any alternative FOSS apps, the customer cannot use these banking applications as intended.<p>I was therefore wondering, what would be the implications for an average, mid-sized bank, to go completely open source? \nHow feasible is it building such an app&#x2F;transaction system especially regarding privacy and security measures (required by law)? \nAnd lastly, what organizational changes within the bank would be needed to make an open source friendly banking system possible?<p>This is hypothetical and solely out of curiosity. I am looking forward to the discussion. Thank you very much!",
