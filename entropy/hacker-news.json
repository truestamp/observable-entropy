      "text": "Hi HNers. I&#x27;m currently using a static site generator, but I am really interested in exploring in-page JS Markdown to HTML tools.\nSo the Markdown to HTML rendering happens as page load time.<p>This would hopefully allow me to forego the static .md -&gt; .html step I use for building my sites.<p>I found one called &#x27;texme&#x27; here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;susam&#x2F;texme<p>Do you use or have written a similar tool? \nI&#x27;d like to find what&#x27;s available and try some of the different tools out.<p>Thanks,\nCameron",
