      "text": "I see some really nice presentations here and there with amazing clip arts, pictures, etc.<p>I wonder if there is a source to get such clip arts, public domain or paid, as a bundle. Or those presenters are drawing and making the presentations themselves.<p>Long ago, when I was young and more into presenting there were the bundles that one could buy and add to MS PowerPoint and use freely. I do not know if that is still the case or if it has changed since then.<p>If the presenters are mostly drawing their own clip arts, what hardware and software are the most commonly used?",
