      "text": "In the modern world, we often view technology as the solution to a lot of our problems. Inaccessibility? The internet allows connectivity! Menial labour getting dangerous? Robotics will automate the processes! However, these one-size-fits-all solutions often donâ€™t take into consideration the logistical and practical limitations that are faced at a grassroots level during implementation.<p>Within Southeast Asia, we have people from about 100 ethnic groups and a population of 655 million people who speak over 1,000 different languages and dialects. It is no surprise then, that each region, demographic and group requires a specific nuanced solution to their individual problems.<p>The solution to this - local startups. With their ear to the ground, local startups are able to identify, adapt and innovate solutions to local problems, keeping the logistical considerations at the front of their mind. However, they lack funds. With Asia having the largest number of internet users in the world, accounting for 53.4% of the global total, Big Tech companies have funds aplenty to invest in this market. Yet, the amount of capital raised by South-East Asia&#x27;s tech upstarts declined to $8.2 billion in 2020, down 3.5% from the year before in continuation of a steady trend.<p>Enter Saurya Velagapudi - founder of Simhapura. With his wealth of experience working in big tech firms overseas, coupled with his Asian heritage, Saurya aims to bridge the gap between these two facets. He offers his expertise to local startups, ensuring their business models are viable and scalable, and ultimately able to appeal to big tech companies to avail their funding.  Every successful local startup brings Saurya closer to his end-goal, which is to ensure that tech dollars are spent on creating the most innovative solutions to solve local problems and bridging the technology gap that Asia often experiences. Essentially, Saurya guides big tech over the rainbow, straight to the Asian Unicorns.",
