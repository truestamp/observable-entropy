      "text": "I graduated school during the pandemic, and attending most of my undergraduate remotely, I didn’t have much chance to pursue research. I am now considering a Phd program but would like to do some research first to see if it’s something I really want to do. I haven’t had much success cold-emailing professors, many who are already overstretched and not willing to take on an outside student. What’s the best way to find research opportunities for someone who is not in school? Should I just read some papers and start tackling a problem by myself?<p>My interests are pretty broad right now, but include cryptography, machine-learning, genetics, astronomy, and music theory&#x2F;production. I’m also located in the Austin area, near the UT campus.",
