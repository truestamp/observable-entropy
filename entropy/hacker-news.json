      "text": "Recently I am seeing more and more unnecessary product features from these big companies (especially Microsoft &amp; co) that keep shipping annoying and often unnecessary features. I sometimes wonder if they even use these features.<p>I feel that this is because the employees at these already established companies need to keep shipping features to stay at the job. Or maybe need to downsize on SE and hire more DevOps.<p>Are SE in these already established companies required to keep shipping features continually?<p>What is your opinion on this?",
