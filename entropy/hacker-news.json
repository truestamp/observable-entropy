      "text": "Facebook&#x27;s website linked in the ads which mentions section 230: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.facebook.com&#x2F;regulations&#x2F;<p>I have now seen multiple ads on how Facebook wants more regulation on privacy. The ads imply that without regulation other companies won&#x27;t handle privacy as well as Facebook does. Below is one of the ads, but the one I watched (and can&#x27;t find) talks more about regulations to help other companies.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qV79Dvwqo9Y<p>Of note, they want regulators to change section 230, which was created before MySpace, and has been interpreted to treat social media companies as &quot;interactive computer services&quot; rather than &quot;content providers.&quot; The status quo protects Facebook from lawsuits, so I don&#x27;t see the benefit outside of a PR campaign. I am for updating section 230 specifically because of Facebook&#x27;s externalities, so I don&#x27;t get the angle.<p>Besides looking like Facebook cares about privacy, why are they advocating for this?",
