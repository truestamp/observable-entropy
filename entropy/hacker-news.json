I spend so much time searching for the actual content on most pages because there are so many links to other crap.<p>For example, check out this Betty Crocker page where there&#x27;s about 300px of whitespace at the top, a huge useless picture of flour, and a navbar that doesn&#x27;t quite stick to the top of the page (viewing on Firefox) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bettycrocker.com&#x2F;how-to&#x2F;tipslibrary&#x2F;charts-timetables-measuring&#x2F;equivalent-measures-abbreviations<p>Another example is allrecipes.com. I think it fares pretty well on Desktop, but on my phone I notice they insert adds throughout the ingredient list and instructions. Also met with a full-screen popup from Amazon about Cyber Monday.<p>There&#x27;s gotta be some plain and simple sites out there, and I&#x27;d like to hear about them.",
