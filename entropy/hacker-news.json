      "text": "Hello HN community! \nSri and Brian here from CloudPal (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudpal.io&#x2F;?source=hn). We are building a tool to help companies reduce their cloud costs by stopping non-production resources when they’re not needed.<p>The problem: Almost every company on the cloud struggles with cost management. While optimizing production costs can be complex, reducing non-production costs should be a straightforward case of shutting down resources when they’re not in use. However, most companies lack an elegant solution for this.<p>The solution: CloudPal<p>- A downtime scheduler for non-production resources (currently supports AWS EC2 &amp; RDS)\n- start &#x2F; stop button, allowing users to override the schedule (eg. if working on weekends).<p>Next up on the feature roadmap is:<p>- Intelligent start &#x2F; stop functionality for non-production resources - resources will automatically stop when not in use and quickly spin back up when needed, resulting in lots more delicious cost savings!\n- Support for more cloud providers and resource types (eg. ECS, K8s, etc.)<p>We&#x27;re really happy we get to show this to you all, thank you for reading about it! Please let us know your thoughts and questions in the comments.<p>Many thanks,<p>Sri &amp; Brian",

      "text": "...just pictures of random people on the social network.<p>That&#x27;s sad; Instagram is the last social network that I still use. Why do they do this? Why is important to them to show content from people that mean nothing to me?<p>Are you on any social network? Are you single? I&#x27;m asking cause I kinda use Instagram as a way of meeting and contacting people. Is pretty easy to not use a social network when you are in a committing relationship.<p>Love to hear the HN community on this issue.",
