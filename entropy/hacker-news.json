My emails simply won&#x27;t send or send after days. When I contacted support, they said that for the first month my emails will go through an  &quot;intensive&quot; spam filtering &quot;just in case&quot; I&#x27;m a spammer, so it&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; to expect delays in sending email.<p>When asked if it&#x27;s normal for it to take more than a day for the email to be sent, they escalated to L2. It&#x27;s been a few days yet I haven&#x27;t heard anything back.<p>Clearly this is not a company I would usually support with my money (what email company can&#x27;t _send_ emails and treats paying customers as criminals?), but the high praise here on HN makes me think I&#x27;m an outlier, so I&#x27;m wondering if people still think Fastmail is great, or there are other alternatives.",
