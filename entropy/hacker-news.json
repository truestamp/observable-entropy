      "text": "We had our YouTube channel for &quot;erpnext&quot; and a few videos in an older channel called &quot;webnotestech&quot;. To consolidate our videos I tried to move the old account to our main &quot;erpnext&quot; account and it deleted all our old videos with 2M views and 11k subscribers!<p>I am a pretty proficient user and I wasn&#x27;t drunk or anything, this is just bad UX. Agreed I may not have read all the details, but there is no way YouTube should be doing this.<p>My feelings: Life is transient and my faith in platforms has been so shaken. There is no way to contact any kind of support for this other than &quot;Feedback&quot;. To all engineers, product managers out there. Please be cognizant of the impact your UX decisions make on your users. And PLEASE MAKE IT HARD TO DELETE data.<p>If any kind YouTube engineers out here, please check if you can undelete our main channel.",
