      "text": "I&#x27;m a sysadmin who has moved into DevOps over the years. As such I&#x27;ve written tons of Bash, Python, and PowerShell scripts. I&#x27;ve got a couple of product ideas, and I can whip up a serviceable backend with the skills I have. Where I get stuck is on the front end.<p>Last year I started looking into React as it seems popular. However the learning curve is too steep and for my needs is like killing a rabbit with a howitzer.<p>I&#x27;m looking for something, where I can create a few editable tables and a few forms. Nothing too fancy, as I&#x27;m just focused on creating a demo of my ideas to show to potential cofounders.<p>Can anyone suggest a front end framework that is straight forward to pick up? It would also be nice if there is a book on it in O&#x27;Reilly books online as I have a subscription.",
