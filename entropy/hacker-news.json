      "text": "I&#x27;ve been trying to start a business lately, and as many people do, have chosen to rely on Google&#x27;s suite of products. Google Ads for marketing, Google workspace for email, Drive for spreadsheets... The works.<p>While working for other companies, I never really had a problem with their services. In fact, Google remains one of my favorite companies of all time for solving the search problem (their search engine is still the best, sorry haters).<p>However, over the past few months, I have STRUGGLED against the tide to use their other services. My Google ads account is currently suspended for reasons I cannot fathom. My Google Sheets spreadsheet is currently frozen (the reason I&#x27;m ranting right now). Their administrative setting pages feel like going to the DMV from the amount of options on screen. Last but not least, their support is almost nonexistent.<p>Am I alone in this? Is this a problem of my own making, by using Safari instead of Chrome, and not configuring my services properly? Or is this a feeling that others get?<p>Conclusion: I hope Google gets some real competition soon because it feels like they are falling off.",
