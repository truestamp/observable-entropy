      "text": "In the past I&#x27;ve been a relatively creative person. Creating side projects and working on my music hobby. The past 6 months however have been an absolute slog in terms of my creative endeavors.<p>I quit drinking and smoking marijuana a little over a year ago...not sure if I should pick up the latter again to see if it sparks something.<p>I had a big life change of moving across the country last month and being a first time home owner that I thought was weighing on me. But since being here this creative rut has continued.<p>I&#x27;m also quite over analytical when it comes to my artistic hobbies. I dream of becoming a famous X, and I feel that has sucked a lot of the enjoyment out of it, to the point where it might be hard for me to do it without this ego-driven motive.<p>Any ideas on how I can kick start the creative process and enjoy it again?",
