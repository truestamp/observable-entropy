      "text": "The coding test delusion:<p>Point 1: Developers are terrible at estimating how long it takes to get software projects done. This is a universal truth.<p>Point 2: Developers issue coding tests to job seekers and are always certain that &quot;We confidently estimate it shouldn&#x27;t take any good developer very long to complete. It certainly wouldn&#x27;t take any of our team very long.&quot;<p>Conclusion: Your coding test takes too long but your team don&#x27;t think so.<p>Outcome 1: Candidates lost, candidates drop your company from the hiring processes they are pursuing.<p>Outcome 2: Candidate completes coding test - your development team &quot;felt it took them too long, certainly longer than  it would have taken us&quot;.  Candidate is marked down.<p>Your team&#x27;s response: &quot;Well they weren&#x27;t very good because it&#x27;s not a hard test, it shouldn&#x27;t take long.&quot;<p>Guaranteed: your team feels this is not a problem for your company coding test.<p>What no company ever does: require every current team member to complete the coding test, measure the time and blindly assess each others test result.",
