      "text": "Hi HN, maybe it&#x27;s just the bubble I&#x27;m in but these days I see a lot of discussion around &quot;no-code&quot; and the &quot;no-code&quot; movement. There&#x27;s also a bunch of new no-code apps being launched every day - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;no-code#order=trending.<p>Some seem to supplement developers (eg: retool) and some empower non-engineers to be able to build websites&#x2F;apps&#x2F;integrations without necessarily having a developer in the loop (eg: shopify&#x2F;zapier&#x2F;airtable).<p>What do you think about this movement? Clearly these apps&#x2F;platforms enable non-developers to solve a bunch of problems which would otherwise need a software engineer. Is this a paradigm shift?",
