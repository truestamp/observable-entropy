      "text": "I&#x27;ve been thinking about alternative funding options for indie hackers &#x2F; bootstrappers that don&#x27;t include debt or venture financing and it seems to me like a cooperative version of a startup studio &#x2F; incubator could be a way to do it. Something similar to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dxdao.eth.link where members can vote to bring on new members and potentially offer to cover living (UBI) and business expenses for a year at a time with an option to re up if there&#x27;s traction.<p>I&#x27;m personally not a fan of crypto but DAOs seem like an interesting business structure that could make it possible to set things up in a decentralized manner and make it easier to manage members vesting in and out if they leave.<p>Starting this would either require a few initial crowdfunded projects or a merger of already profitable bootstrapped companies willing to use some of their revenue to fund things (ideally new projects that they&#x27;d be customers of).<p>TLDR: How can we build the Y Combinator for Indie Hackers without needing VCs and infinite growth?<p>(also posted on IH: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;would-you-join-an-indie-hacker-dao-cooperative-if-so-how-should-it-be-structured-864503bd13)",
