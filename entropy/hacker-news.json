      "text": "There appear to be many on HN who are sceptical of the utility and value of cryptocurrencies. And more generally, plenty of people feel that cryptocurrencies are a bubble. \nIf we want to back our intuition fro profit, it would seem we should be able to buy a put option on say Bitcoin. However, it doesn’t seem like such an instrument exists. All methods of shorting cryptocurrencies seem  to involve buying cryptocurrencies with which to buy the option, then taking your profit in cryptocurrencies or tethers.\nWhy can’t we go to an established exchange, buy a put option with say USD, and receive any profits in USD?",

Sure enough, I stopped after 2 songs. Got bored. Needed a little more stimulus.<p>They say it’s about dopamine baseline. Scrolling instagram is 10x stronger dose than listening to a good song. If you scroll Instagram every 2 hours, then just music is not really much of pleasure.<p>I think this just might be behind this burnout generation. I have many times find myself absolutely unwilling to clean my house or take out the trash. It wasn’t always like this. Years ago, I would’ve found pleasure in doing those things.<p>Now I simply don’t.<p>Is it really too much screen time? Is my dopamine baseline all out of whack? Or am I burnt out? Do I need to take 6 month sabbatical?<p>I wonder if anyone else is going through this sort of thing.",
