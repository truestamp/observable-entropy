      "text": "My friends and family like to text each other every day while playing the NYT Spelling Bee puzzle, trading hints, etc. So I thought it would be fun to build a multiplayer game inspired by the spelling bee where people can play together. You can start a new game whenever you want and you can invite up to 3 people to play with you. You can each find words and you&#x27;ll see what words your friends have found.<p>You can try it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bee-genius.onrender.com&#x2F;<p>I created a dictionary and generated thousands of puzzles. I tried to reach a good balance of including enough words for the puzzle to be challenging without so many obscure words that it&#x27;s frustrating.",
