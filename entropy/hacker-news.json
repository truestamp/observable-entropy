      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Brave browser for a solid month now, I installed it October 25th and forced myself to use it consistently for a month. Generally I&#x27;d say:<p>- Feels snappier than Chrome, could very well be my imagination but I don&#x27;t see it killing my laptop nor do I find I get tabs locking up, these things both happen once or twice a week with Chrome.<p>- Ad management in Brave is very aggressive and frequently have to &quot;turn down shields&quot; (a button to turn off all the blocking) - this ends up being an issue on my brokerage platform, condo management app, stuff like that but it&#x27;s easy to turn off.<p>- Google translate support is horrendous. Chrome can real-time-translate a page, even a chat window as it&#x27;s scrolling, picks up live changes in the site and translate them. tl;dr google translate in Chrome is very good.<p>- Credit card management in Chrome seems for some reason to be more elegant, I&#x27;ve yet to manage to get it to work well in Brave.<p>All in all I&#x27;m much happier using Brave, it seems like a faster less bloated browser that doesn&#x27;t destroy my laptop, (and I feel less and less comfortable with google), so this is a good alternative for me, I don&#x27;t envisage going back any time soon.",
