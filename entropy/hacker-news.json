      "text": "Does anyone remember a recent post here with a description of a note taking method (with pictures). I don&#x27;t think it was quite kettelkasten. What I think I recall from the post: each lecture got a single page, the pages were mostly visual with concepts drawn and text to explain. I find myself working on a tool to use ML to aggregate knowledge and that visual keeps floating to the surface. I think if I could see that image again it would inspire a cleaner and more intuitive way of displaying information.",
