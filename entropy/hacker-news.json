      "text": "We have seen a lot of native token faucets for testnets on the internet. But we haven’t quite seen any NFT faucet anywhere. As a developer, it’s quite irritating when we need NFTs to test our code but we need to go through the tedious process of minting a new NFT into the wallet you want (and choosing a picture has always been a pain).<p>NFTank (NFT tank for dummies) solves this problem. NFTank will allow users to quickly request NFTs to personal wallets or smart contracts in just a few clicks. If you need a custom image and name in your NFT, we got you covered, you have the choice to provide details for the NFTs. If you choose not to do so, we will send you a placeholder NFT with a default image and a randomized name.<p>How to use NFTank as a CLI?\n- Install NFTank via npm, yarn, or any other package manager which supports npmjs registry.\n- Run either the &quot;nftank mint:erc721&quot; or &quot;nftank mint:erc1155&quot; command based on your choice whether you want to mint an ERC721 NFT or ERC1155 NFT.\n- And that&#x27;s it ! It was as simple as that.<p>Links\n- GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;buidler-hub&#x2F;nftank\n- npmjs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;nftank\n- Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftank.xyz",
