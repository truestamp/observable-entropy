      "text": "Hello guys and ladies,<p>I’m a self taught programmer who has been getting software engineering interviews. I’m applying to Software Engineering jobs that require little to no experience.\nI’ve studied SICP and HtDP. I have also studied Proofs and CLRS. So as you can see I have studied almost the core of a CS degree.<p>I have build some math systems in Lisp and Python but nothing great. 600 lines of code or less. Lately I’ve been doing web dev with Django and react. I have built a full stack web with these. So I’ve built a rest api and a frontend to consume this api.<p>Should I keep applying and just practice leetcode type of problems? Or should I study OS and Software construction from ocw mit? I am also interested in compilers. Should I do these first or can I keep applying to roles? That’s my debate right now. Thanks",
