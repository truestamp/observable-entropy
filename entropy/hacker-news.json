      "text": "In a few days, we will be celebrating the 5th anniversary from the release of python3.6. With python3.10 released a few months ago, do you believe that maintainers of python packages should still provide support for python3.6? This of course comes with plenty of trade-offs, such us not being able to update dependencies, additional code and testing to handle python version incompatibilities and the list goes on. As a maintainer of a package that was created after python3.6, I have got multiple requests to provide support for it, which is of course something that I would be keen to avoid. The answer depends on the library domain I guess, but I would like to get a holistic view of the matter.",
