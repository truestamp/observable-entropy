      "text": "Hey everyone! Would like to learn more about Crypto and Blockchain, and I love playing &quot;party games&quot;, which are board games like Chamaleon, Cards Against Humanity, etc.<p>Challenges to learn about this:<p>There are sooo many fluffy terms in the industry that are probably not that complicated to understand.<p>These terms make it hard for me and I guess a lot of ppl to get into it.<p>Listening to podcasts, talking to people, and reading on Twitter is fine, but not as fun as playing a game.<p>Anyone else with me?<p>Research:<p>BGG&#x27;s top 5 list, I don&#x27;t find an educational list, or a crypto one.<p>The games to learn crypto are all online, and mostly to learn how to trade, or &quot;play-to-earn&quot; (which you already need to have a wallet). They don&#x27;t focus on its concepts and are not across the industry (Defi, Web3, Blockchain, NFTs, etc).<p>Questions for y&#x27;all:<p>Do you know any board game to learn crypto?<p>If not: Do you know any board game to learn about concepts, an industry, or a topic?<p>Thanks for reading, and please let me know if anything needs clarification",
