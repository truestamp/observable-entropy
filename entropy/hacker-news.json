I was sexually abused for years as a child. I don&#x27;t harp a whole lot on things like &quot;rape culture&quot; but I&#x27;m baffled and disturbed that this was flagged to death.<p>Why is a copyright-free educational resource of this sort &quot;not HN worthy&quot; in your eyes?<p>HN is okay with talking about OnlyFans content policy re actual porn but has some issue with letting people know there is a site like this out there? This doesn&#x27;t add up for me. I don&#x27;t see where that line is being drawn.<p>Perhaps someone could help me understand this.<p>Thank you.",
