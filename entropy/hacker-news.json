      "text": "Hi HN!<p>My day job is a Ruby on Rails position. I&#x27;m considering looking for new positions, and wonder if learning Python would be worth it for coding interviews. I&#x27;m open to another Rails position, but it&#x27;s not my preferences so I&#x27;m not sure about using Ruby for interviews since Python seems to be a lot more common for those types of questions. I also know TS&#x2F;JS, but have heard that there can be a stigma when using JS for non webdev roles. Any advice?<p>Thanks!",
