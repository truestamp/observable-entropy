      "text": "Say, a mother has an account on an educational web platform. She now wants her 12 year old daughter to also use the platform. But as the daughter is a minor, her mother wants an oversight into the daughter&#x27;s account to identify bullying, threats and abuse.<p>How would a web authentication and account management system be built for this requirement? What should be taken into consideration when building such a system?<p>One way to achieve this is to let more than one person access the account(in the above example both mother and daughter can access the daughter&#x27;s account, even simultaneously). But this could give rise to lot of security issues. How does one mitigate that? Or are there better ways to implement parental oversight into web accounts?",
