I know about TempleOS, but that&#x27;s a bit too esoteric. And I know about say, Windows 3.1, but that won&#x27;t run natively on modern hardware.<p>I&#x27;ve searched for e.g. &quot;very simple fast booting linux&quot; but that just turns up results like Arch Linux, or how to make Ubuntu boot faster.<p>Is there anything out there?",

They all had interesting technologies and was well-funded. I thought it would be good to learn from history this time around. Why did they fail?",
