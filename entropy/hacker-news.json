A company has reached out to me saying they have a buyer for the shares.<p>I&#x27;d like to sell because they expire in Dec 2023 and I don&#x27;t know if there will be a liquidity event before then, however they want to take a 5% cut.<p>Is this a normal cut for a middleman in this type of transaction? Is there a way I can connect with a buyer directly to avoid giving a % to a middleman like this?",
