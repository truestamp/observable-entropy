      "text": "Hey it&#x27;s Dave Rogenmoser,<p>Today marks an exciting moment in our company&#x27;s history; we&#x27;ve chosen to rebrand the company from Jarvis to Jasper.<p>The origin of the name Jarvis came from the community as their pet name for our AI writing assistant. Sure, we knew J.A.R.V.I.S was the name of Tony Stark&#x27;s AI assistant in the Marvel movie Iron Man, but after due diligence with our lawyers, we had good reason to believe no one would actually confuse our real AI assistant Jarvis with the fictional character from the movies.<p>Then our Jarvis got popular... very popular.<p>Over the last 12 months, over 350,000 people have loved using our AI writing assistant rating it 5-stars from over 2,500 reviews. Two customers even got tattoos of the Jarvis logo!<p>This growing enthusiasm and community fandom raised concerns at Marvel.<p>Eventually, their lawyers felt they needed to defend their trademark for the name Jarvis and sent us a cease and desist for using &quot;AI assistant&quot; with &quot;Jarvis&quot;.<p>When we received the letter from Thanos, I mean Marvel, two thoughts came to my mind:<p>Oh crap, Disney is threatening us... But we have a legitimate argument to use the name in this category so maybe we could win.\nActually, this is Disney we&#x27;re up against. Even if we have a solid argument, they can keep us in court for as long as they want, draining our bank account and distracting us from progress. Is it really worth all of that just for a name?\nSo rather than spending all this time and money fighting Marvel to keep the name Jarvis, which would distract us from continuing to build an awesome product for you, we decided to change our company&#x27;s name from Jarvis to Jasper.<p>Say hello to Jasper :-)<p>Claim your free trial: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;jasperai",
