      "text": "I&#x27;m a 36 year old founder who quit a $200k a year job to work on a startup. I figured I had a year of runway (I have a mortgage and other fixed expenses so I can only cut so much fat).<p>Now that year is half up, I have a MVP that I&#x27;m polishing for beta launch in October but all the investors I talk to want to see traction before considering investing in a seed round.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I have enough cash to get to significant traction -- I&#x27;m a B2B SaaS so the sales cycle is long and will require me to spend money to make money -- so the question I have is... what is your experience? Is it possible to raise seed funds without traction or have most of your startups needed traction first? (not counting asking family for cash)<p>I keep hearing about people on HN raising absurd amounts of funds on nothing but an idea... but I have a working prototype and all the East coast investors that I have talked seem to care about is traction. Basically they only want to invest in companies that don&#x27;t need the money and only want to use it to accelerate growth.<p>All the best, thanks for any advice.",
