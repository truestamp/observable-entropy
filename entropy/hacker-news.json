      "text": "I recently started refreshing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms and discovered that I actually really enjoy the subject. Studying the Union-Find data structure, for example, has really helped me rediscover the joy of programming.<p>After a few years in the industry, I have mostly accepted that most programming jobs these days are &quot;lego programming&quot;, in the sense that we don&#x27;t really use &quot;computer science&quot; knowledge in our day jobs, we mostly just connect API&#x27;s and write business logic. I&#x27;ve mostly come to terms with this. But a couple of times a year, I start to wonder if there are any jobs these days that are more than just &quot;lego programming&quot;.<p>So the question: does anyone here have a job in which the code they write is more &quot;computer science&quot; and less &quot;lego programming&quot;?<p>My hope with this question is to have a few modern examples of interesting computer science roles in industry, rather than reignite the old &quot;all we do is CRUD&quot; pity party.",
