      "text": "Lots of imagery on TV shows handheld foggers misting public spaces. I am confident this stuff works for mosquito borne disease, all it has to do is stop hatching of larvae. It appears popular in Asia, south America, Africa, India. I am trying not to assume this is bogus populism.<p>But, do these mister units actually do anything useful against an aerosol dispersed disease? It feels from here behind the TV set its performative hygiene theatre, and does nothing of substance. Because of mosquito control they have the devices, and they can fog bleach, or TCE or something (that would be terrible)<p>Or, are &quot;fomites&quot; still a real concern?<p>UV was said to be used to &quot;sterilise&quot; aircraft interiors. I would probably ask the same question: does it do anything useful?",
