      "text": "So I&#x27;ll put it simply, I&#x27;m currently doing Bsc Computer Science, and entering my third year, going through the courses I have, I&#x27;ve realised I haven&#x27;t been learning anything of substance, that I can put on a CV or actually work further on. Just snippets of concepts and coding, along with other irrelevant courses. I am passionate about my field and want to learn more. I don&#x27;t know where to start what to look in, but I just want to be an expert in my field and not clueless. I&#x27;ve recently started web development, html,css,js,nodejs etc and will be learning more on that but other than that I don&#x27;t know what else to do. Ideally I just want to be up-to-date on what the CS world is going to demand by the time I graduate and hopefully even do stuff&#x2F;projects before my graduation so I can write it on my CV. What are the things I need to learn&#x2F;do outside of my degree?",
