      "text": "I have a laptop with a humble amount of disk-space and a desktop with a massive amount of disk-space.<p>I would like for the desktop to be a logically infinite source of storage, while the laptop stores only what I am currently using.<p>For example, if I have a &quot;photos&quot; folder with 10tb of photos, I would like to see a list of all the photos when I open the folder on my laptop. If I then select a specific photo to open, my laptop checks if it already has it downloaded locally and if not, silently pulls it from the server. If I do that thousands of times and run out of space on my laptop, the laptop should automatically purge the LRU photo to load the new one.<p>From the laptop&#x27;s perspective, it has an unlimited amount of space - the only noticeable thing is that some files take longer to load than others.<p>A critical component of this is that both systems are automatically synched. If a folder is created on the laptop, it is also created on the desktop. If a file is created on the laptop it is automatically backed up to the desktop. If a file is added to the desktop, its metadata is automatically synched to the laptop. Etc.<p>The desktop stores a superset of the the laptop and nothing else. The laptop always knows all the files on the desktop.<p>What self-hosted, preferably FOSS, software does this?",
