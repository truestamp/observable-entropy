      "text": "So, I was reading someone who said it would be difficult to organize a general strike in a country the size of the U.S. I don&#x27;t have any particular interest in doing this but of course it piqued my organizational software side and I thought - what are the requirements for organizing strikes?<p>I tried to search for some software that helped people organize strikes but no luck.<p>Although HN is probably not heavy on people who have organized labor movements or strikes or what have you, it is still a big community so maybe someone here has some insight into strike organization and what kinds of software is generally used for it, if there would be any reason to have specialized strike organization software (for example if there are specific requirements that would benefit from applications with built in functionality)",
