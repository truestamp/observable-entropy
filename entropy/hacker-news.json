      "text": "Working in academy taught me one huge concept about editorial world. Some publishing houses that work exclusively for profit tend to focus more on the quantity than on the quality.<p>For some months by browsing HN, I&#x27;ve been amazed at how many open books written by normal people (self-published resources) that need to be discovered. So I was wondering: is there anywhere a list of &quot;open&quot; books? Let&#x27;s give some authors some notoriety, if you found one, please comment below!<p>A books&#x2F;resource to be defined as &quot;open source&quot; should have the following features:<p>- have a good quality content – it is a little bit hard to achieve, especially when you do not have money to hire editors;<p>- be free as PDF&#x2F;HTML, but the author can still have donations, or can be paid for hardcopies;<p>- anyone can contribute to writing or editing! &quot;source code&quot;&#x2F;content of the book is hosted in a Git instance;",
