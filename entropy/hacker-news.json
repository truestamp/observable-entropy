      "text": "Wonderful series with great performances of Edi Gathegi and Martin Freeman [1]. Unbelievable rollercoaster of events with up to date themes like crypto, VÇ&#x27;s, dark web...<p>Don&#x27;t watch it if you&#x27;re a techno perfectionist. The way they write code is hilarious, releasing software patches is instantaneous and new products are created in a week. Yet, some of the management faults and chasing VC money are quite realistic.<p>I had a great time (and some great peaceful nights because I realized things can still get worse in startup land ;-)<p>Post which tech&#x2F;mgmt pieces you liked most, perhaps with a [spoiler alert] for those who haven&#x27;t seen it yet.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.netflix.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;80154285",
