      "text": "I&#x27;m a bit mixed up now and would love some stranger’s stories.<p>I&#x27;m a Machine Learning Engineer Consultant. I&#x27;m working 3 days a week and get paid well to do so. I know I&#x27;m very privileged and lucky to be in this position but I&#x27;m also very unhappy with the role. This makes me quite frustrated because I feel like a massive sook and an ungrateful brat.<p>I&#x27;ve had different jobs that paid a third of the rate but have been happy. The main difference, as far as I can see, is having people around and building repour with a team. I really enjoy working with people. Right now, my output has been suffering horrendously because I’m struggling to find the concentration needed to get my work done to a normal standard. I just squirm in my seat, alone in my apartment, getting frustrated. My guess would be to work towards managing people, but I don’t know how to approach that without years more work? At this point, I don’t know if I’m silly for looking for an industry shift. I really appreciate creative people so I’ve approached some suitable companies, but they almost find it weird that I’d want to make the change.<p>For those that love community but work remotely, alone or with little others, how do you do it?",
