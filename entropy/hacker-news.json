      "text": "My name is Peter. I&#x27;ve been programming for several years, but not yet professionally. I&#x27;m pretty good with Python &amp; Django, and OK with Javascript, and I&#x27;ve done a lot of small&#x2F;medium hobby projects. I&#x27;d like to get a job coding, but I&#x27;m not sure how to transition into a technical career. I&#x27;m a generalist for sure, and I&#x27;m pretty confident in my ability to code and solve problems, but I think I&#x27;m going about the career&#x2F;job aspect the wrong way.<p>I&#x27;m open to different ideas, and I&#x27;d be glad to give back in whatever way I can to anyone who&#x27;d like to work with me.<p>You can check out most of my projects at github.com&#x2F;lawsonpd, and just DM if you&#x27;d like to know more!<p>Cheers!",
