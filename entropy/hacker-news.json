We have so many productivity tools for work. How about having a fun tool for your unique life beyond work?<p>We can go nerdy and talk about some cool features like:\n- Drop Slack-like message card with any format of attachments\n- Organize your thoughts in a drag-n-drop fashion to merge, quote and move them. \n- Hashtag and Unix PATH like tag group with one tap autocompletion.\n- Tokenizing input and finding related cards from previous thoughts spontaneously while typing. This truly blurs the line between creating and searching. *Even supports voice recording!\n- Publish your archives as websites in one tab, and fine-grained control who get access to what portion of your content or whether and how they can react to it.<p>And we got all these under a clean &amp; minimal UI that won&#x27;t bring you any pressure as many Productivity Apps may and has no content feed to lure your attention. Unless you really look for it, mysc. will just be your personal safe space to drop random thoughts with no distraction and noise in sight.",
