So, I get rejection mails from some roles which we really liked.<p>Usually, when we take interviews to our team, we focus mostly on arrays&#x2F;hashmaps&#x2F;strings, etc as we encounter them in all the work.<p>Not sure why these companies still want to use Linked List even for senior interviews.",
