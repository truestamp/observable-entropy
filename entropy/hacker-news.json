      "text": "Hi guys, I built a platform that makes it simple for anyone to join a group of anons to buy an NFT. No money deducted till funds are raised. Safe since the underlying is a DAO. So the steps are as follows:<p>1. Paste an OpenSea&#x2F;Rarible link of the NFT you are interested in on our website<p>2. You can see if there are other people who have contributed money to this &amp; how much money they have contributed<p>3. You can enter the amount you would like to invest (any amount as low as 1 USD). No money deducted at this point<p>4. Once enough funds have been raised, money will be deducted from your wallet, and you will own part of the NFT. You can see your ownership on a dashboard that will be sent to you by email<p>Thoughts on this?",
