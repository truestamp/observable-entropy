      "text": "I&#x27;ve found it useful to maintain email filters for technical recruitment companies so that I can separate these from my other email and review at a time when I can give them the attention required, depending on whether I&#x27;m currently looking for work.<p>This takes regular maintenance and so I&#x27;ve created a repository along with some scripts for automating the filter strings for my GMail account.<p>The hope is that others may find this useful and contribute domains to the repository.<p>Note that as per the README, this is NOT a spam list. Recruiter email is essential for finding work. This is just to make the work of sorting email easier.",
