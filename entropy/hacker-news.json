The latest addition is a description for each search engine, just hover over the name, and you get a description derived from the sites meta and title tags.\nI think that specialised search engines are gaining ground, it has become easier to set one up, thanks to elasticsearch&#x2F;lucene. They can be quite good, for a limited domain, and they don&#x27;t have to invade your privacy in order to find out what you are looking for. I think that what is missing are tools like this, that would aid the discovery and use of these search engines. I hope that this will allow them to eat into the market from the &#x27;low end&#x27;.<p>The projects source is here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mosermichael&#x2F;duckduckbang\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mosermichael&#x2F;duckduckbang</a><p>Unfortunately they don&#x27;t invest too much into !bang operators at duckduckgo, however that&#x27;s my input data...",
