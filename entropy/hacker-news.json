      "text": "Hi HN!<p>A few years ago our company moved to a new office. That office has a insufferable bathroom in terms of privacy. You could hear a needle fall on the floor inside of it which made it very uncomfortable to use the bathroom.<p>Many people ran the tap water or fake coughed to cover their “noises”, especially doing “no 2”.<p>I got sick of not being able to be comfortable in the bathroom and hearing everyone’s toilet business so I decided to make a music player using a Raspberry Pi and soldered on a motion detector that started a white noise and music whenever you entered the bathroom to hide these sounds.<p>A lot of people said they wanted one so I thought hey I should try to make this into a product.<p>A lot of time and money was wasted hiring consultants until I 13 months ago said “enough of wasting money, I’ll just build it myself”.<p>Today I launched a kickstarter and am selling 50 units.<p>Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;loodio&#x2F;loodio-bathroom-privacy<p>I know people in US have loud fans and such to cover for this, and a lot of people just play music on their phones but the problem with that is: when you manually play music in there you indicate you are going to do something embarrassing!<p>How else are you solving this problem?<p>I tried all existing solutions like the Sound Princess from Japan and other chinese crap on Amazon&#x2F;Ali but they were not up to the task.<p>I think there could be a market for Loodio. \nWhat do you think?",
