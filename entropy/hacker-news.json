      "text": "Every now and then, when I work on a project the infamous vision, mission and problem statements come up. From what I understand, they&#x27;re fundamental to creating any kind of tech business.<p>But I don&#x27;t get their importance and I wish I could somehow frame my project in another way but to create a vision.<p>I don&#x27;t want to galvanize with promises about a vision. I&#x27;d rather just document what&#x27;s there and where we&#x27;re at in the present.<p>So are there successful projects that have diverged from the classical &quot;problem, vision, mission&quot; statements?",

Either leave it the way it was, or do it right.<p>Perhaps simply adding another button to the issue for &quot;Complete Issue&quot; or something would allow users to choose the resolution type.
