      "text": "We are a small-ish (&lt; 50 FTE) SaaS company in the education space. Was wondering what people were seeing as the best options for hiring talent. We&#x27;ve primarily done off-shore and still have a good continuing relationship with our vendor&#x2F;team. We&#x27;re at the point where it makes sense to bring some more expertise in house. We don&#x27;t do anything special technically (react&#x2F;ruby&#x2F;postgres), but there are some things in our space that is better handled in-house (student-data, privacy, etc..).<p>My question is how are you as a small company able to find qualified candidates. Is the main driver just pay and remote work? What were some easy drivers for filtering out candidates? If you had a name unrecognizable to 99.9999% of applicants, how did you stand-out and make it seem attractive? Am I better off finding senior US-based devs who can hit the ground running through contract work &#x2F; agencies?",
