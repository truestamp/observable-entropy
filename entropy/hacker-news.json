      "text": "The question was prompted by this HN post today (Browser Fingerprinting Without JavaScript)[1]. The article suggests I could still be tracked so I started wondering about the effects of JavaScript (JS) on advertisers.<p>Hypothesis: Tracking primarily benefits advertisers. Adverts are primarily delivered in the browser by JS. By disabling JS, my value to advertisers is diminished. As data collectors can&#x27;t sell my data at a profit, they should stop collecting my data.<p>Is that hypothesis valid?<p>My own motivation for disabling JavaScript was simply to avoid experimental DHTML stuff (like wierd mouse effects) back in the day - not privacy or tracking - but I&#x27;m still really happy with that choice - I get to browse a quieter web. But has it made me less worth while to track?<p>If it was just me as a NoJS user, advertisers wouldn&#x27;t bother about it. But imagine if Halloween was the start of an annual &#x27;NoJS Week&#x27; during which <i>everyone</i> disabled JS. Would worldwide advertising spend drop and if so, by how much? 1%? 10%? 90%? And what kind of drop would we see in sales?<p>1. As a tracked human, do I have an advertising value?\n2. Is my advertising value less than someone who enables JS?\n3. Do advertisers measure this?\n4. Are there just too few NoJS users for this to matter?\n5. If I disable JS, am I still worth tracking?<p>[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29042791",
