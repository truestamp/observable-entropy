      "text": "Do particle accelerators create black holes?  Consider four scenarios:<p>1.  Two protons collide head on, creating a quark-gluon plasma.  This decays into a shower of particles that fly off in different directions, conserving charge, spin, energy, and momentum.<p>2.  Two protons collide head on, compressing everything far enough to create a microscopic black hole.  This very quickly evaporates via Hawking radiation, creating a shower of particles that fly off in different directions, conserving charge, spin, energy, and momentum.<p>Could we experimentally tell the difference between scenarios 1 and 2?<p>3.  Two protons collide head on, creating a new, unstable particle.  This decays into a shower of particles that fly off in different directions, conserving charge, spin, energy, and momentum.<p>4.  Two protons collide head on, compressing everything far enough to create a microscopic black hole.  This takes a detectable amount of time before it evaporates via Hawking radiation, creating a shower of particles that fly off in different directions, conserving charge, spin, energy, and momentum.<p>Could we experimentally tell the difference between scenarios 3 and 4?  I <i>think</i> the answer to this question is that yes, we could tell the difference, because if it were a black hole it would decay with a time that depends <i>only</i> on the mass, charge, and spin, and I don&#x27;t think that unstable particles follow that pattern.",
