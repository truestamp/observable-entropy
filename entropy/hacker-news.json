Their increasing lack of quality, the complexity in building one.<p>I wonder if its not possible to have an extension of some kind, in which the users browsing activity is the mechanism by which sites are crawled.<p>For instance, I&#x27;d love a search engine that is the sum of HN users web activity. Perhaps that&#x27;s one channel of many.<p>Is this feasible, and does it offer any benefit over traditional search engines that indiscriminately crawl the web?",
