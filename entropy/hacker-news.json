      "text": "Is there an application (open source or commercial) that will save whatever I copy to the clipboard in a permanent store and then enable me to search items based on keywords. A simple implementation could be it dumps each item in a directory in a file. The file name could be based on the timestamp of when the copy happened.<p>Image search might be harder. But at least for text the search should be straightforward.<p>How hard would it be to write such an application? Basically you just need a way to dump each clip event to trigger generating a timestamp, and then saving it to a (configurable) location.<p>Why this application should exist. This would save me and many other people working in our times so much time. Instead of looking for things I saw a few days I could always search through my infinite clipboard.<p>I see some clipboard apps. What they lack is easy searchability.<p>If something like this exists please share.",
