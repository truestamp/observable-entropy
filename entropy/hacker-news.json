      "text": "You can remove lots of noise on YouTube using these:<p>- SponsorBlock<p>- uBlockOrigin<p>- No YouTube Comments<p>- Disable YouTube Cards<p>- Remove YouTube Suggestions<p>- BlockTube<p>BlockTube lets you block individual channels via channel IDs. You need to add each of these IDs manually. You can also import a list of IDs.\nI am looking for a list of IDs targeting primarily influencers and clickbait channels. (I would also like to block anything related with politics, news, drama, ...)<p>Titles akin to &quot;You Won&#x27;t Believe This&quot;, &quot;Almost Died&quot;, &quot;This Will Shock You&quot;, &quot;I Ate Nothing for A Day And This Is What Happened&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Learn C++ in 2021&quot;, &quot;Learn C++ in 2021&quot;, &quot;I Bought 2 Million Pokémon Cards And This Is What Happened&quot;, &quot;CNN Breaking News: Somebody Smirked&quot;, &quot;Fox News: Cancel Culture Strikes Again&quot;, ... are quite annoying.\nSuch unsolicited titles still sometimes occur in my search results. I would like to eliminate them completely.<p>I am unsure whether BlockTube lets you regex for typical clickbait titles.<p>Furthermore, I am thankful for any suggestions&#x2F;strategies to mitigate noise on YouTube as much as possible.<p>Thank you in advance, HN!",
