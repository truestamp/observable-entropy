      "text": "I exclusively use VSC. Its greatest appeal to me a few years ago was its simplicity. If there were shortcomings, usually I&#x27;d find a workaround (e.g., an extension) and things were mostly fine. But I feel like with each update, I&#x27;m introduced to a whole bunch of features that overall make VSC more complex. I want to get the job done, but nowadays I must constantly keep track of recent changes in VSC.<p>Do you feel the same? What&#x27;s the solution&#x2F;alternative to this complexity?",
