      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I built Teamates.io[0] - a place for professionals to have small coffee chats with a random partner right now.\nThink of it like a virtual coffeeshop where you can chat with strangers while you&#x27;re taking a little break.\nIt&#x27;s in open beta and you can try using it right now. Please be nice and professional to each other :)<p>I noticed over the course of pandemic I missed casual elevator and coffee chats with my coworkers,\nas well as random chats with strangers. I think it&#x27;s important to have these unplanned conversations\nto feel more connected with other people and learn random stories&#x2F;ideas.<p>I would really appreciate the feedback from you all, since I believe it&#x27;s a pretty important problem to solve.\nFeel free to leave a HN comment or fill out a survey at the end of your call. I took a day off to reply to your questions and feedback, as well as talk to you directly on the platform :)<p>Thanks,\nAibek<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.teamates.io",
