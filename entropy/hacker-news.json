      "text": "Is depression good of bad for business?<p>There are many reasons why it&#x27;s good, escapism for one: who doesn&#x27;t want to reward themselves after a crappy day by buying something they don&#x27;t need, with money they don&#x27;t have, to impress people they don&#x27;t like? So that can facebook it or tweet it or IG it. Vacations, cars, clothes, fancy restaurants.....<p>On the other hand, a lot of entrepreneurs wannabes can&#x27;t get past the risk of not having a steady income, or being ridiculed by family, friends, and peers (depression&#x27;s cousin anxiety would do that), and all those insecurities and sense of doom is not good to start something, to give light to the multitude of ideas in someone&#x27;s creative head.<p>So, is depression good or bad for the economy?",
