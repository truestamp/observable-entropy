      "text": "Hey, Hugo from Infracost (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infracost.io) here. Infracost shows engineers the cost of each Terraform change in CI&#x2F;CD before launching resources. When something changes, it posts a comment with the cloud cost impact. e.g. you’ve added two instances and volumes and have changed an instance type from medium to large; this will increase your bill by 25% next month from $1000 to $1250 per month.<p>Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve been working on a native evaluation for Terraform. Previously we relied on the Terraform CLI to fetch cloud resource information, which was a little slow and cumbersome.<p>Native parsing is not only lightning-fast, but it means we have contextual file information, which allows us to try a load of cool new things. For example, we could provide real-time suggestions to optimise your cloud costs as you write your infrastructure code! This VSCode extension is the result of a few weeks of hacking away whilst I should have been relaxing in the sun in Italy... time better spent, I think!<p>We&#x27;re excited about the possibilities of directly integrating with editors. There is so much we can do to make DevOps lives easier when optimising cloud spend. Right now, we&#x27;re looking for your feedback on this initial version of the extension. It currently ships with:<p>1. Show a snapshot of the total cost of resources right above their Terraform definitions. Updated on file save.\n2. Resource and module blocks support showing cost estimates, including 3rd party module blocks.\n3. A cost overview web-view shows a detailed breakdown of what components affect the price.<p>Please note this is an early release of the VSCode extension, so there will likely be bugs. If you get stuck, please raise an issue (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;infracost&#x2F;vscode-infracost&#x2F;issues), and we&#x27;ll help you out asap.<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this extension, mainly what you think it’s missing and would help your workflow. Head over to the GitHub repo (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;infracost&#x2F;vscode-infracost) for more information and installation instructions.",
