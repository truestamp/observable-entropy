      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for a tool that surely exists but I can&#x27;t seem to find it. I have thousands of small video files, and I&#x27;d like to process each one independently across a cluster. The processing can defn benefit from GPU for some parts of the workload (e.g. object detection); it is all pytorch code. Ideally, would like to use cloud computing for this (so EKS would be preferable but can also spin up machines and setup slurm, etc. if need be). I&#x27;ve looked into GNU Parallel, Dask and PySpark. I&#x27;m a bit frustrated that most examples assume you have numpy arrays&#x2F;csvs at the start .. surely there exists a tool that deals with this at the &quot;files&quot; and &quot;scripts&quot; level? I feel the closest match I have seen is Hadoop but again, one where I can chain scripts together.",
