      "text": "I&#x27;m pretty sure yesterday I can use ``` (triple backtick) to indicate a code snippet, but today the function is disabled. I checked the other code snippet functionality (that you can access from Format-&gt;Code snippet) and its interface is changed so I figured this must be an implicit corporate update that went off the radar.<p>My question is: I&#x27;m getting enough of this, and TBH I don&#x27;t give it a fuck about corporate IT policy if it constantly gets in my way. Is there anyway to hack it to just completely prevent ANY update on Microsoft products on MacOS?",
