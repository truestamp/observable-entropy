      "text": "Crowdstrike internally has been struggling with how to deal with gogo&#x2F;proto essentially being EOL while also being able to gracefully transition off of it. They&#x27;ve worked on 2 things here:<p>1. A wrapper to allow easy moving off of Gogo back to Google protobuf thats able to marshal and unmarshal protobufs from any of gogo, google proto v1, or google proto v2<p>2. A custom encoder and decoder that is optimized for runtime performance (around 20% faster for proto2 and around 40% faster for proto3)<p>Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CrowdStrike&#x2F;csproto",
