      "text": "A friend of mine was recently socially engineered &amp; lost their Facebook page with just shy of 100k followers + the Meta Business account as well. The hack was fairly simple:<p>- Attacker convinced them they were a legit sponsor<p>- Attacker asked them to add my friend&#x27;s own email address to their Business account as an admin<p>- Friend thought this was innocuous, they weren&#x27;t already a day-to-day user of Business manager account so it seemed normal that they&#x27;d need to set their own account up<p>- When the Business invitation came to my friend&#x27;s email address they added the &quot;accept invite&quot; URL to the Facebook profile at Attacker&#x27;s request &quot;to enable sponsorships&quot;<p>- Attacker then clicked the link, accepted the invitation &amp; had instantly taken over the Business account<p>The user never left Facebook &amp; never entered anyone else&#x27;s name or email address but when they published the accept invite link the attacker was ready to click it and there is apparently no auth protection on this URL.<p>It doesn&#x27;t appear that Facebook will do anything unless their system automatically agrees that someone&#x27;s personal Facebook account was <i>hacked</i> and that the change of ownership happened as a result of that. Anyone know how to get ahold of anyone?",
