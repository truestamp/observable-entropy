      "text": "Recently at my seed-stage startup (~6 engineers) we had our engineering manager&#x2F;director leave for a new opportunity.  We&#x27;re doing well so-far, and looking to create an organizational structure that can grow the group.  As such, I&#x27;ve been asked (volunteered) to step up and lead half of the group in a managerial sort of role.  I&#x27;ve been on the team for about half a year, and while I&#x27;ve led development teams before, this will be the first time I&#x27;m managing humans.<p>I&#x27;ve been a full-time developer&#x2F;engineer for nearly eight years now (in several different industries and all in larger companies), and would say I&#x27;m fairly competent and eager to take on new work for the success of the company.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s people here that have been in a similar kind of situation.  I&#x27;d love to hear any advise you&#x27;d give to a first-time manager, or specifically someone in my position.",

      "text": "One sentiment from the recent Roe v Wade decision is that women should be careful about their data as law enforcement could use it to determine if they had an abortion.<p>Period tracker apps are quite popular, and even a form of contraception [1]. They technically don&#x27;t need to access the data (although they may wish to for analytics&#x2F;monetisation), so it seems to me like a perfect candidate for E2E encryption. But I can&#x27;t find any that advertise they use E2E encryption (just a vague &quot;we encrypt your data&quot; in their privacy statement).<p>Is anyone working on this?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.naturalcycles.com<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a man, and I don&#x27;t live in the US.
