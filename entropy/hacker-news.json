      "text": "As eCommerce giants become bigger and kill small businesses by developing similar products, or pushing for low prices. I believe systems that empower these shop owners with payments and transportation and giving this shop owners the right to retain their goods but essentially provide them with a decentralized platform for sales. This would disrupt the giants as this model would empower shop owners to be in control especially in developing countries and emerging markets. The cost of capital associated with scaling an eCommerce model like that of Amazon has experienced significant failure in many developing countries. With blockchain technology advancing it would be interesting to see how decentralized commerce makes use of DAO to regulate the quality of goods on this platform, smart contracts for escrow, and also for logistics. Hope the near future proves my hypotheses right and also facilitates the adoption of staple coins for eCommerce.",
