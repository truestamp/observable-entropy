      "text": "My idea is to give a home for creators to find jobs without swarming into the pool of various job postings out there. So, I began coding a full-stack web app but wait, there is another way I can do it in just 3 mins.<p>Here it is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jobs4creators<p>Yes, a Twitter profile. Twitter got everything a job board needs. It gives a domain, hosting, messaging service, instant update, etc. So why bother building an app?<p>It&#x27;s simple for creators to access job openings too. I just went with it. The kind of jobs postings I expect here are content creators, copywriters, marketers, video makers, designers, etc.<p>And I highly expect your feedback on this. Feel free to roast :P",
