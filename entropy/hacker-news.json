      "text": "Tonight my wife (hence I) had a very unpleasant experience with Microsoft Word on Windows 10. She lost half a day of work because as she saved the document she was working on for hours, Word partially froze: the window was not responding. I tried the save button: no visual feedback. I tried the close button: it closed the window immediately. After reopening the document, we realized that only the first page got saved.... you can imagine the feelings about the universe in that very moment. Unfortunately she was not using OneDrive, and I don&#x27;t think there was anything left to do to recover any previous version (checked temp files, nothing). Has this ever happened to you? Do you have any recommendations on how to handle these cases (apart from not using Office ever again)? For the moment, I would say, use OneDrive (maybe it was part of an evil playbook by MS after all...), but I&#x27;m open to any suggestions that could help my wife (and I) process the frustration.",
