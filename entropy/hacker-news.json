      "text": "I am a college student at Carnegie Mellon. I built a utility-based social network for CMU students.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starterpack.live&#x2F;<p>CMU has a yearly Carnival which was this weekend, so I chose to launch it then. In our first day, we penetrated about 50% of all undergrads, and we are getting good use. My idea is simple<p>1) We find a niche online community \n2) We find their problems \n3) We see which alternatives they use\n4) We solve each problem in a simple micro-web-app \n5) We add all the apps into one &quot;starterpack&quot;<p>Youtube cannot get users to view livestreams, but we can easily get Dota or LoL starterpack users to view livestreams. Except I messed up and launched too quickly since the semester is already soon over. This is not the right time to expand to other schools since summer is coming.<p>Further, I&#x27;m poor! I&#x27;ve had a horrible response from investors (can&#x27;t beat incumbents, doesn&#x27;t scale, solo-founder, part-time, have to find product market fit for each community, Reddit can just copy). I grew up sporadically homeless and my family is still financially troubled, so I will be working remotely at my internship and at my family restaurant until 11pm everyday this summer. It is so frustrating.<p>For the CMU starterpack, I am making a daily Wordle-like puzzle, updating the fence, moderating, and adding new features. However, even as more CMU students use it, I want to discontinue it as I realize this will be more prohibitive come summer than beneficial.<p>How do I gracefully shutdown so that I may revive the project next school year?",
