      "text": "Over the last year&#x27;s I have worked in different roles and with different technologies. Python, Go, C, TS&#x2F;React, domain specific languages and tooling, and played with frameworks like Elm and Svelte. Mainly in the areas of web, technical simulations, and DataScience.<p>I would argue that I am flexible but that comes at a cost, low specialization.<p>My question: To build a career, how much do tech stacks matter? Should I stick to one (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL) or doesn&#x27;t it really matter as long as I can ship something? Is it fine to use Svelte for a new project when breaking into the market or should I stick to React?<p>Note: I worked in different roles not described as SWE but in practice I am writing code full time for almost 3 years. Building a career refers to &quot;becoming officially a SWE&quot;.",

      "text": "AutoInit is a weight initialization method that automatically adapts to different neural network architectures. It tracks the mean and variance of signals as they propagate through the network and initializes the weights at each layer to avoid exploding or vanishing signals. AutoInit can be used to improve performance of feedforward, convolutional, and residual networks; configured with different activation function, dropout, weight decay, learning rate, and normalizer settings; and applied to vision, language, tabular, multi-task, and transfer learning domains. The software package provides a simple wrapper that makes it possible to apply AutoInit to existing TensorFlow models as-is. We invite you to try it out and see if it can improve the performance of your neural network models!<p>For further details, see\n- GitHub repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cognizant-ai-labs&#x2F;autoinit\n- arXiv paper: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2109.08958<p>AutoInit is also available through the Cognizant AI Labs Software page, together with related software on estimating model uncertainty, multitasking, loss-function metalearning, decision making, and model management, at\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evolution.ml&#x2F;software<p>-- Garrett Bingham &amp; Risto Miikkulainen",
