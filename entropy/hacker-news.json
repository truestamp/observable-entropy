      "text": "I’ve yet to find people with similar enough motivations, outlooks, and experience that we can work well together as a strong team.<p>It’s been easier for me to work solo and look for options to maximize the amount of work that I could get done alone.<p>Given the mythical man month principle, I feel that I’m right in choosing to delay as much as possible collaborating with other people.<p>It seems that working as a group is only beneficial when most of the critical decisions have already been made, and there is already a great process in place so that everyone knows exactly what they need to do and there are fewer arguments.<p>But I also come across people who don’t seem to have any strong sense of individuality at all and no strong desire for independent thinking.<p>It seems coming from solo runner&#x2F;climber vs ball player instinct.<p>People whose natural instinct is wired to play and enjoy soccer&#x2F;football etc are hard for me to understand.<p>And they seem to have taken something from growing up and playing as a team into their work, they would say things like:” you can only win as a team and you can’t win alone.”<p>So I am not sure if my introverted instinct is an advantage or a blindspot.<p>And since I am currently building a product for other people, I am concerned that I might create too many introverted assumptions and biases in the app, especially considering how people think of their time.<p>I think the app I’m creating would be great for solo devs, but how many 100% solo devs are out there anyway?<p>So do you tend to say “ our work” or “my work” more often in thinking about your work time?<p>Like how do you draw the line between your work, your effort and others effort?<p>I would appreciate any insight on this topic.",
