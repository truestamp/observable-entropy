      "text": "Hi folks!<p>As the title says, I want to practice coding a GUI framework, probably in C++.<p>I read about a retained and an immediate modes, have a rough understanding how event loop works, and overall my goal is to practice architecture and optimization (especially cache-friendliness), and less so graphics and typography rendering, though I understand it&#x27;s unavoidable to implement a rendering pipeline (I plan to start off with AGG or Skia graphics libraries).<p>The dummy app itself will be less about forms but more about data representation, e.g. an audio editor or a node-based system, where data should be updated and visualized in real time, and everything should feel responsive.<p>Could you please give some research directions? Maybe case studies, best practices, some interesting software, maybe to read more in detail about related architectures, etc.? Or maybe personal stories? I&#x27;m struggling to find related info which would not be focused on some framework, etc.",
