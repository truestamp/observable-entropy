      "text": "Hi HN,<p>COVID lockdowns made me and my wife cook a lot more at home, and we had a need to streamline our recipe management woes. These were some of the problems we identified:<p><pre><code>  - Most recipe websites are what I call &quot;mommy blogs&quot;, and the principal problem is that the recipe ingredient list and instructions are buried in a SEO-laden essay that we don&#x27;t care about. We were sharing links to our favorite recipes, but links don&#x27;t allow you to skip past the unnecessary essay prefacing the recipe. We knew we wanted a way to have recipes uncompromised by unrelated essays.\n  - Popular recipe aggregating websites are run by publishing companies that do not want you, the reader, to contribute your own recipes. This is not true for all of them; Allrecipes.com does allow you to enter recipes but that UI leaves a lot to be desired. We knew we needed a way for us (and you) to write your own recipes.\n  - Most recipe websites do not allow you to scale recipe ingredients. We like to cook a lot at once, and we don&#x27;t like to keep track of a 2x, or 3x multiplier in our heads while cooking. We knew we wanted a simple way of scaling ingredients.\n  - Most recipe websites do not contain adequate nutrition information about their recipes. When they do, they don&#x27;t show their math, or their sources. We knew we needed an automatic nutrition calculation for recipes based on ingredients and their quantities.\n</code></pre>\nAfter a few months of nights and weekends, we are ready to share <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letscooktime.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letscooktime.com</a> . We solved all of the primary problems listed above, and more! Our features:<p><pre><code>  - Recipe creation\n  - Ingredient highlights in recipe text\n  - Recipe components\n  - Automatic nutrition calculation\n  - Grocery lists\n  - Scaling recipes\n  - Tagging\n  - No blogging, just recipes! No bullshit essay to scroll through.\n  - Dark mode!\n</code></pre>\nWe think the closest thing to CookTime is <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paprikaapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paprikaapp.com</a>. Paprika is a paid native app, CookTime is a free mobile-ready website you can try _today_. I do not believe that recipe management really requires the performance, development cost, and App Store cost of a native app.<p>Without a CookTime account, you can:<p><pre><code>  - Browse recipes \n  - Read their nutrition facts\n  - Scale ingredients temporarily\n  - Share links to recipes\n</code></pre>\nWith a CookTime account, you can:<p><pre><code>  - Add your own recipes\n  - Add recipes to your personal groceries list\n\n</code></pre>\nLet me know what you think! Would you use it? What are you currently using to track your recipes? What missing feature is stopping you from using CookTime?",
