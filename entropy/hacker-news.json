      "text": "I purchased my first &quot;Smart TV&quot; running Google TV. I discovered this product is incredibly hostile to someone who wishes to control what is displayed on their family TV.<p>If you use it as a &quot;Basic TV&quot;, it de-activates the Chromecast software which to-date we have used as both a picture frame and video cast.<p>If you use it as &quot;Google TV&quot;, there is no way to completly remove &quot;recommendations&quot; that are displayed on the &quot;home&quot; screen, and there is no way to display Chromecast ambient mode by default when you start a TV or switch between inputs. The &quot;app-only&quot; mode still displays recommendations (ads) and doesn&#x27;t show the library, which <i>would</i> be useful for children to choose and control their own shows.<p>Please do the following:<p>* Add an Option to add &quot;Chromecast&quot; to an &quot;Input&quot;: HDMI1, HDMI2, Chromecast<p>* Add an Option to only show Library on home screen.<p>* Add an Option to opt-in to everything shown in the Library.<p><pre><code>   - Watchlist (Y&#x2F;N)\n\n   - Display Movies: All or Selected Movies.\n\n   - Display Shows: All or Selected Shows.\n\n</code></pre>\nSincerely, A rather frustrated parent.",
