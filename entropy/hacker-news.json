      "text": "Phones that can&#x27;t get software updates are more at risk of becoming targets for malware. Many phones only get software updates for a small number of years, often three years or less. Usually they get only a short time of firmware updates, a somewhat longer time of first-party bugfixes, then merely app fixes and possibly third-party ROM fixes.<p>Yet modern phone hardware is often still plenty fast enough for everyday use when the updates dry up.<p>Hence my question: what is the actual real-world danger of not updating your phone? Did anything ever happen to you or your phone because it wasn&#x27;t updated?",
