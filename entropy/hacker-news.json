      "text": "I recently made a database for a side project (10-15 tables, moderate complexity). I estimated it would take 40 hours for the entire db (tables, columns, relations, validations, indexes), but so far it has taken 5x as long and still isn&#x27;t finished.<p>I&#x27;d like to get better so such blow-outs don&#x27;t happen in the future. Here&#x27;s my plan:<p>1. Before modelling, map out business processes thoroughly on paper or whiteboard, including edgecases.<p>2. Implement ideas early to inexpensively discover if they work or don&#x27;t work<p>3. Experience improves pattern recognition, so practice, practice, practice.<p>4. Know the types of table associations well<p>What other things can a self-taught SWE do&#x2F;read&#x2F;watch to get better at quickly and competently designing relational databases?",
