Similarly to work in fields like graphics, ML computer science students must learn areas of math like linear algebra, probability, etc.<p>If you were asked to design a general math curriculum at university level which subjects will you make compulsory and in what order? Keeping in mind that when a student goes out after learning this curriculum, they can easily pick up new areas when needed.",
