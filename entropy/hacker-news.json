Initially I was planning how to write this all, but I&#x27;m assuming this is common enough that something exists, or perhaps a reverse proxy setup where www leads to something WordPressish, and forum leads to something phpbbish.<p>Anyone have a similar experience&#x2F;recommendations?<p>If it matters at all, I know nothing about frontend dev or php for that matter.  Mainly C&#x2F;Go&#x2F;Python.",
