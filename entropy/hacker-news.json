      "text": "I&#x27;m no great software engineer, but I&#x27;m curious if there are any strong opinions on which executable format is the best.  Formats like PE or ELF or (a.out?) or others?<p>Typically if you run a particular operating system you&#x27;re not going to see several types of executable formats.  The question wouldn&#x27;t come up.<p>There have to be others with odd advantages, like an executable format that lends itself toward streaming-in the parts of the binary you&#x27;re executing (exec as you torrent, lol).  Or perhaps 1 that stores different parts of itself in a SQL database (read-only, strings, debugging info, etc).  Someone has to have created an executable format out of sqlite databases.  I remember &quot;Universal&quot; binaries on Mac archived several architectures&#x27; binaries together.<p>In the interest of a discussion I haven&#x27;t seen:  What is the best executable format and why?  What are some creative ones?",
