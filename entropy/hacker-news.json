      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m Steve, co-founder of Factor.fyi, a new data platform for querying and visualizing financial datasets using SQL. During the pandemic, I took much more of an active role in managing my portfolio. I wanted to be able to make informed decisions about the investments I was making, and explore financial data in new ways. Market and Econ data are some of the most talked-about and widely-available datasets out there, but I was frustrated by the lack of options to answer questions I had, like, &quot;What would have happened if I had started dollar-cost averaging VTI back in 2013?&quot;[1] Or, &quot;How many days did BTC and ETH move in the same direction as the S&amp;P500?&quot;[2]. We built Factor to answer these questions. You can use Factor to query disparate datasets in ways that are impossible on any other platform. We currently have 20 datasets [3] that you can use to answer questions you have about the markets and create beautiful visualizations around them. Factor is community-powered and free forever; you can browse our community-built charts here [4].<p>We&#x27;d love to get feedback from the HN community, hear your thoughts on what datasets we can add, and get advice on how we can make the querying experience even easier for those new to SQL.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;factor.fyi&#x2F;questions&#x2F;dollar-cost-averaging-the-market-since-2013-a1ikcvysfi\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;factor.fyi&#x2F;questions&#x2F;dollar-cost-averaging-the-marke...</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;factor.fyi&#x2F;questions&#x2F;s-p-btc-dia-correlation-factor-by-week-since-2019-a57q11kzxw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;factor.fyi&#x2F;questions&#x2F;s-p-btc-dia-correlation-factor-...</a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;factor.fyi&#x2F;docs&#x2F;dataset-reference\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;factor.fyi&#x2F;docs&#x2F;dataset-reference</a>\n[4]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;factor.fyi&#x2F;browse\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;factor.fyi&#x2F;browse</a>",

      "text": "Out of curiosity, in large software teams or organizations, are there developers who specialize in updating dependencies? (The developer <i>can</i> contribute actual code and whatnot, but their top priority would be in keeping dependencies up to date.)<p>My hypothesis is that, given a large enough team or organization, a large enough number of projects, and a large enough number of dependencies, there may be some benefit in having somebody who specializes in keeping (3rd-party) dependencies up-to-date.<p>If you have 10 projects that use the same dependency (let&#x27;s say django-rest-framework), would it be better to have one person who spends time really grokking the release notes and adapting the codebase for breaking changes? If you know how to update django-rest-framework for one project, you probably know how to do it for another project, right?",
