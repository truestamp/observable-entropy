      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m looking for some advice and&#x2F;or enthusiasm on which programming language you might recommend to a young journeyman programmer looking to broaden their horizons beyond the mainstream imperative stock.<p>As some background: Like many from the past decade, I was introduced to programming and cut my teeth via Python, and while it holds a soft spot in my heart for its lovely syntax and idioms (personal preference), I am growing weary of chasing down run-time errors in production and the squishyness of its type system (or lack thereof).<p>From there I&#x27;ve followed along the well-trodden path of imperative&#x2F;OO languages one would expect to become acquainted with during the &quot;standard&quot; CS education, namely C &amp; Java, along with some Golang thrown into the mix. I adore C for its close mental alignment to the computer&#x27;s operations, and while I appreciate Golang and Java and have no great qualms with either, they don&#x27;t scratch a certain itch.<p>My daily driver at work is Typescript. I find writing vanilla js to be generally objectionable.<p>I would classify myself as a competent journeyman, and I am really looking to branch out and broaden my perspectives. I&#x27;m not sure what itch it is I&#x27;m trying to scratch, but I&#x27;m looking for an enthusiastic community and a language that brings a lot of &quot;joy&quot;, if that makes sense. I&#x27;m not looking for any commercial benefit out of this, but hey, if being an expert in the lang is highly profitable, that&#x27;s also a data point.<p>A good type system might be where my interests are first piqued, but it&#x27;s not a hard requirement. Similarly, my mind jumps to Functional Programming, but purity is not a requirement either.<p>So, if you&#x27;re an experienced vet, found yourself in a similar situation beforehand, have been having similar inclinations, or are just a fanboy&#x2F;girl for your specific lang, please share your thoughts!<p>Should I be wrangling data functional-style sans types with Clojure?<p>Playing around with the BEAM with Elixir&#x2F;Erlang?<p>Diving into Scala types and the Akka framework?<p>Jump into the deep end with Haskell?<p>Try my hand at Rust and systems software?<p>Ocaml, a language I know nothing about?<p>I have formal CS training, so I&#x27;m not overly intimidated by the more &quot;academic&quot; languages.<p>Thanks a lot in advance!",

      "text": "I&#x27;m using qemu to build Ubuntu server VMs on my mac, and I want to use cloud-init to configure the VM. Everything works fine but there is one command I cannot run on my mac:<p><pre><code>    cloud-localds -v --network-config=network.cfg ubuntu.img cloud_init.cfg\n\n</code></pre>\nI haven&#x27;t found anything similar to cloud-localds available on Mac. So, it seems that in order to boot my Ubuntu VM I first need to boot another VM to run cloud-localds... a bit frustrating.
