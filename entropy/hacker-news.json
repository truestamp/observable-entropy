      "text": "Although there are countless Android phone makers, there isn&#x27;t a single one of them that makes compact phones. Sony was in the business for a while but it seems to lower the supply of the new models and mark them with super high prices. \nThat&#x27;s very strange as there is clearly demand for smaller phones, shown by the iPhone mini. Apple offers an almost identical compact phone to it&#x27;s regular model, but it seems that phone makers who usually copy Apple on everything, just skip this idea at all. \nIf anyone has thoughts on it or a compact model to recommend I&#x27;ll be glad to hear.",
