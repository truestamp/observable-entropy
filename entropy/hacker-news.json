Today the application is localized in more than 14 languages and gathered users from different countries.<p>Bluefy is an effective solution for those who want to optimize their experience in web development, customization of Bluetooth devices, and want to create new solutions.<p>Bluefy is a standard browser with a minimalist layout. The developers have announced a lot of updates that are waiting for the application soon. Users can create read lists and bookmarks using the Folder Manager. Updates touch the boot manager, which will become much more convenient and functional.<p>Developers improve the settings of work in full-screen mode. So users, when working with Web API pages and when creating PWA solutions, will be able to expand the space for work.<p>The Bluefy app is customized for iOS users and is one of the best on the market. In addition, the app is completely free and contains no built-in advertising. Developers continue to update and improve the technical part of the application. Initially, Bluefy did not restrict users to the number of devices to connect to. There are currently no problems with multiple connected devices. The most important thing is to use the web API pages that support your devices.",
