      "text": "Hi HN,<p>Avid reader here, never a poster - til today. I&#x27;ve built Atlas Connex and wanted to show it off and hear what you&#x27;ve got to say!<p>What&#x27;s it do&#x2F;what&#x27;s it for?<p>It&#x27;s a SaaS&#x2F;IaaS tool meant for taking the burden off engineering teams when integrating disparate networked systems.<p>For example, you need to build some continuous, event-driven ETL type data flow, but you can&#x27;t modify the source and&#x2F;or destination systems or it&#x27;s a pain to do so, Atlas Connex is meant to plug in here.<p>It can accept data from any source type (HTTP requests, MQTT topics, polled APIs, etc.) route it through a series of filters and transformers (which either make decisions about dropping the payload altogether or massage&#x2F;format the data) and then send it on to a destination, which can be a multitude of endpoint types and formats as well. Delivery is done via managed queues which can be paused, throttled, etc., so unreliable endpoints are not dropping data, they are just queued up for later delivery.<p>The idea is that a team only needs to write a small piece of Python code (which is the filter language) and define a route to get a reliable data flow up and running. Whether it&#x27;s a fan-in (many sources to one destination) topology or fan-out (the other way &#x27;round) the platform is meant to unburden teams with the &quot;getting the data there&quot; part so they can focus on using that data in automation, building real value, etc.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear any and all feedback, from first impressions, to anyone who will give the system a test run and give technical feedback, let me know!<p>Lastly, thanks HN for being an awesome place for makers, builders, and tech folks!",
