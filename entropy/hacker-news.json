      "text": "Hello, is iPad Pro + physical keyboard a viable substitute for Macbook Air? I am not familiar with iPadOS ecosystem and not sure how powerful the apps are.<p>1. I am looking to use it for Keynote, light coding, typing, browsing, Photoshop and Illustrator. My assumption is that iPad Pro may be better for graphics work b&#x2F;c of the pencil and the rest would be on par with a laptop once you add a physical keyboard. A big upside is that I can use a split keyboard and save my hands from RSI pain that I&#x27;d get from long typing sessions on a traditional keyboard.<p>2. I know Apple offers 16GB of RAM with a 1TB version. I don&#x27;t really need 1TB, but am looking at this iPad to serve me for ~5 years and 16GB would be an absolute minimum of RAM I&#x27;d go for in a laptop. On the other hand I keep reading iPadOS doesn&#x27;t even utilize 16GB. I hope someone on HN can clarify if 16GB is worth buying if I&#x27;m ok with just 512GB or would that be just a dead weight. Thanks.",
