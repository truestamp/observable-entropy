      "text": "I stumbled on this old book today called &quot;Transaction Processing&quot;[0] that never made it past a first edition in the early 90s. It is a leviathan treatise on the unification of conventional and distributed database systems, operating systems, computer networking and software engineering. How could a book like this end up in the digital dust bin?<p>I looked up the first author, Jim Gray. Apparently, the guy won the Turing Award in 1998 for &quot;for seminal contributions to database and transaction processing research and technical leadership in system implementation.&quot;[1] I studied computer science at university and have never heard of such a thing. Frankly, I am shaken there are still astonishing ideas, like &quot;transaction processing,&quot; that hover unnoticed over the ivory towers. What&#x27;s the point of lofty ideas if everyone doesn&#x27;t know about them?<p>Jim Gray seems to have disappeared mysteriously at sea around 10 years after receiving his Turing Award. Now he doesn&#x27;t appear a widely recognizable name, even among HN. I searched for &quot;Transaction Processing&quot; in the HN archive, but didn&#x27;t find anything on Jim Gray.<p>It makes me wonder who else didn&#x27;t get all their roses when they were due? Who are the underrated Turing Award recipients?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Transaction-Processing-Concepts-Techniques-Management&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1558601902<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jim_Gray_(computer_scientist)",
