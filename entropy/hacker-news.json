      "text": "My friend works in a bank and for a long time has wanted to make the switch to Python. To date, he has read a few books and knows some intermediate concepts, such as closures, generators, etc.. Outside of Python, he has built workflows in Alteryx and knows some SQL.<p>His teenage son challenged him to start applying for roles in 3 calendar months from now. He figures he can dedicate a max of 3 hours per day. How should he best use his time?<p>Should he drill on Leetcode? Build a small portfolio? Gain a specialization within Python?
