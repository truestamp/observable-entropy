What are some activities (ie hobbies, leisure) that you do regularly that help you get through the day&#x2F;week etc?<p>It could be anything from sports&#x2F;exercise, music&#x2F;art&#x2F;craft, games&#x2F;puzzles, to talking with a friend, watching a comedy, etc. Anything relatively self-imposed is fair game.<p>And it would be <i>super helpful</i> if you could share some details on how you think the activity helps you rest&#x2F;recharge etc.<p>Thanks so much in advance!<p>PS. I&#x27;ve asked similar Ask HN&#x27;s recently but I could never figure out how to frame it in a way that gets the point across. Hope this one makes more sense.",
