There is no email option provided to receive a confirmation code, and the only way to contact support directly is by signing in to the account (can&#x27;t be done while the account is locked).<p>Prior to the migration from Minecraft to Microsoft I never had any issues with using any of our Minecraft accounts.<p>Whoever at Microsoft thought this was a good idea is causing them to lose business.",
