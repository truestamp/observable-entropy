      "text": "There&#x27;s mass psychosis happening right now, in the form of people being programmed by social media + doom-scrolling. People don’t realize just exactly how dangerous social media + doom scrolling are. That algorithm is an evil MapReduce. It tricks you into enjoying dopamine hits when consuming non-stop negative information, which will degenerate the human brain at a young age and cause hatred and anger at an old age. It makes the young hopeless and lethargic and depressed, and the old intoxicated with fuming hatred at each other.<p>This algorithm is designed. To degenerate a mind until it can no longer fight back. It accepts all the information it is given, and allows itself to be programmed. Programmed so that it starts choosing self-implosion and degeneration.<p>It was designed this way to collapse the social fabric of great nations.<p>The only way America can ever fall, is from within. And let&#x27;s face it, the gullible amongst us are easy enough to manipulate. With extremely precisely timed ads and  content, for fast food as well as for ideas, you can program the more susceptible to believe what you want them to believe.<p>What this means, is that we should take every precaution against a virus that is gonna just get worse. The virus is absolutely dangerous and common-sense precautions are good. But we must not move heaven and hell to implement systems of oppression that track every movement and every imperfect nature. Otherwise you will be seen as part of the toxic soup if you are imperfect, which you all are because you’re human.<p>Stop the doom-scrolling. This may be our last chance to really understand what’s going on. Explain to your parents and grandparents what doom scrolling is. Check if you are a victim of it. We must restore the American spirit of pride and innovation and dominance and muscle. Give me American muscle goddammit. We didn’t leave the gulags just to go back. Don’t be overly negative. Be positive, because the doom-scrolling is designed to make you give up.",
