      "text": "Hello HN, I&#x27;m looking to start a new project and I&#x27;m curious to see if there are any alternative for modern web apps that don&#x27;t fall into the SPA approach but still having a dynamic frontend with js and with page rendering fast. Specially if it&#x27;s something that it&#x27;s fast and easy to setup and has a built-in way or plug-in to authenticate users.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just too much to ask and a SPA with React or Vue with an API in the backend is still the best way to go.<p>I was imagining an ideal world where you could have a project quickly setup with Django and then a sparkling of Svelte here and there to enhance things up in your views.<p>Cheers",

      "text": "We are excited to announce Cedille, the largest language model for French (6b parameters).<p>Demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cedille.ai<p>Language models are general purpose AI systems that are able to solve a range of tasks by simply being prompted for it. It can be used for example to summarize text, do translations, or for idea generation &amp; overcoming writer&#x27;s block.<p>You may know GPT-3, the humongous model from OpenAI. Cedille is a similar model targeting the French demographic - but smaller, as we don’t yet have $1b in the bank like they do. Although GPT-3 supports multiple languages including French, our model is competitive with GPT-3 on a range of French tasks! Plus, of course we’re open source while they keep their model closed and heavily restrict access to it.<p>You can try it out right away from our playground: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.cedille.ai<p>We are proponents of “open AI” and as such have released a checkpoint for the world to use (MIT license): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;coteries&#x2F;cedille-ai<p>One of the problems with large language models is the potentially toxic, sexist or in other ways unpleasant output. We tried our best to avoid this issue by doing extensive dataset filtering. As a result, our benchmark indicates that Cedille is indeed less toxic than GPT-3.",
