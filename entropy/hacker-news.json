This &quot;offset&quot; OFFSET is the public key.<p>To encode, Alice starts with the private key, creates a new transcendental number using some random offset. Call the new transcendental number PAD = f(PRIVATE, OFFSET).

Knowing PAD then PRIVATE can be recovered. However, if Alice and Bob share a secret method of choosing a new PRIVATE after each communication then they can continue the scheme.<p>The key question is how to find transcendental numbers.",
