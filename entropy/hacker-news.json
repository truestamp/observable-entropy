      "text": "Hello to all the HN community! It&#x27;s Nik here, I founded WeLoveNoCode (welovenocode.com), a platform that connects people with the best no-code developers to build their software and apps without a single line of code. All that is based on a monthly subscription.<p>My startup just raised $1M in funding and we reached a monthly recurring revenue of $170k+ within less than a year. I have learned a lot from other makers here, So I decided to also share my experience about building a startup that is growing at rocket speed. I hope this helps other entrepreneurs (and if you are looking to join a fast-growth startup, I’m hiring).<p>So, how did we achieve this kind of growth in a short time? I drafted some important lessons I learned and would like to share them with you:\n- Start with Satisfying your Customers\n- Educate the market.\n- An MVP tells you what your customer really wants\n- Find a model that works\n- Be very clear with your value prop\n- Approach Marketing with a growth mindset\n- Fundraising is hard: You should see things from an investor&#x27;s perspective.\n- VC money is not the only way.<p>Now, let&#x27;s dive deeper in comments:",

      "text": "I am an experienced Java engineer (5+ years). I know Java and JVM well enough to do my job that was usually around building microservices&#x2F;apis etc, I know theoretical stuff well enough to pass core java interviews for senior positions. However, I am applying for a position that requires a lot more than that, it&#x27;s to do with finance&#x2F;HFT and they will be asking questions around lower level java I assume. I don&#x27;t have a spec of what they might ask, I assume stuff around JMH, concurrency and JVM tuning, but maybe anyone know more and can point to the learning resources?",
