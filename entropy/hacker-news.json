Let&#x27;s say you can click on one button with bronze, two buttons with silver, and three buttons with gold.<p>Do you hard-code these business rules, or do you use a rules-engine? What is your go-to way to implement things like trials, discounts, etc. in the product?<p>What is your go-to way to fragment all the features into a feature grid&#x2F;matrix and grant&#x2F;deny&#x2F;limit&#x2F;meter access to any given feature on the fly? Do you have successful examples using rules engines for that?<p>Thank you,",

      "text": "Hey, We are building a grocery delivery platform (Glist), where you could get up to 100% discount on groceries, vegetables, meat &amp; fish.<p>But when I talk this, that we can provide up to 100% discounts (I mean free), no one is ready to believe it.<p>We do that through invitations (referral marketing). When you invite your friends and when they make a purchase through us, you get a percentage of the sale, as wallet balance. It&#x27;s not 1 time, but whenever they purchase you get a referral percentage for the sale. We provide 1% of the total sales as referral commission, which is not huge at all. But when the volume increases, that becomes big for the customer.<p>For example: let&#x27;s say you buy $400 worth of groceries every month.\nSo when you refer, one of your friends, who also buy $400 worth of products through us, you get a $4 (1%) instant discount on your next purchase.<p>If you were able to refer, 100 such customers who buy $400 worth of groceries every month, you will be able to get $400 discounts every month, that&#x27;s a 100% discount for your monthly groceries.<p>100 referrals might seem hard to reach. But we help our customers through educational content&#x2F;videos to reach that level using simple social media and online marketing techniques, by providing all their customized marketing materials.<p>------------------\nI would like to know what&#x27;s your take on this idea. It&#x27;s a simple idea.",
