      "text": "As the title says, I have a phone interview tomorrow. I&#x27;m working on switching careers from being a chemist to software development, so I&#x27;m even more stressed as I feel like I still have so much more to learn. The company is in NY, and I&#x27;m in Canada, but its remote so that&#x27;s cool.<p>Regardless, right now I&#x27;ve been going over fundamentals (Python, SQL, JS and C++ are focuses of this company) and reviewing what I did for my GitHub projects, why I made certain design decisions and how I could improve them. I&#x27;ve been practicing some leetcode as well, especially since I failed my last technical interview a few weeks ago, and I know I need to improve on the data structure&#x2F;algorithm questions that companies ask.<p>Is there anything I&#x27;m missing in terms of preparation? Any advice welcome, thanks in advance :)",
