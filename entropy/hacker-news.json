      "text": "I&#x27;ve been programming since I was about 10, starting with BASIC, then ActionScript 2 and 3, then Objective C, then Javascript, Swift, back to Javascript to learn React, Next.js etc etc. and using these I&#x27;ve made websites and apps with millions of downloads, had books published.<p>BUT, I&#x27;m entirely self taught, and I feel like I&#x27;m likely missing a bunch of things that &#x27;properly&#x27; trained programmers know. But you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know, right? I would definitely fail any kind of code test with sorting algorithm type questions for example.<p>Has anyone also been along this path and realised these important things they don&#x27;t know? If so, what are they?",
