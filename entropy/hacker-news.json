      "text": "Hey All,<p>Long time lurker but first time poster. Long story story, I write IT content as a side gig for several very well traveled IT sites Not going to name drop but odds are you are a weekly visitor to most, if not all of them. Have been doing it for 10 years plus but the issue...<p>The really interesting stories I have no one will buy because they are focused on privacy, digital freedom, the law and lawbreakers but I can&#x27;t get a bite because its not &quot;How to do XYZ in some SAAS&quot; or &quot;IT failures, how to avoid them&quot;, &quot;The time I burnt down the DC&quot;&quot; I fought the tax man over IR35 and lost&quot;&#x2F;some standard IT related subject. I have written some of this and some places have taken it (and the unique visitors and comments sky-rocketed) but because it&#x27;s not advertiser friendly, no one wants it.<p>I can sell the how-to&#x27;s all day but my real passion is security, personal privacy and digital rights but they don&#x27;t tend to go well with the data harvesting based sites for obvious reasons. I reach out to my usual contacts but if its not some hot new SAAS technology or such they are rarely interested. I have tried broader interest sites but half don&#x27;t even have the decency to acknowledge you. Either that or they want the content for free.<p>For example, something that is super interesting to me is the non-kinetic war that is brewing in the background of Ukraine and beyond and how it will affect us, now and if it ends up going &quot;limited kinetic&quot;. I believe it would redefine the internet that we know and love, for the worse.<p>I am happy to share some examples privately if people are interested but I don&#x27;t want to go plastering them on here for obvious reasons.",
