      "text": "Today I traveled to NY from CA and because of that I&#x27;m on my 15&quot; $5.5K MacBook. For some reason at the time of my Apple purchase this was the largest screen size they offered.<p>Also today, I was inside of my company&#x27;s web browser based admin portal, and a field I needed to see at the top of the page was hidden. Turned out that our lead developer grew our navbar and for some reason this prevented me from seeing what I needed.<p>I asked the dev if my laptop should accept having its small screen be the reason, or if it should blame him (the dev) for what was about to happen to it (being thrown out of the window and sent to heaven). Dev explained to me that I should go to BestBuy to get a large monitor.<p>We&#x27;re one less team member today.<p>Hope you&#x27;re having a better day!",
