      "text": "I&#x27;m currently working on a startup with no revenue and very little traction. I&#x27;m running out of money and will likely have to stop soon and go back to work.<p>I&#x27;m scrambling trying to figure out how to save the company in it&#x27;s last days but I mostly just have no idea what I&#x27;m doing and will probably just have to get a job and try again later.<p>Most of my days are filled with stress and dread.<p>In spite of that I still love working on it and if I can find any way to continue that&#x27;s what I plan to do.<p>My question is, for people who have been in this situation, what do you tell friends and family when they ask &quot;how the startup is going?&quot;<p>Sometimes this question feels passive agressive but more often people are just genuinely curious. It&#x27;s really a pretty reasonable question.<p>But I don&#x27;t have reasonable answers. It&#x27;s both great and terrible in ways that are hard to get across in a short conversation. I don&#x27;t have the time to fully explain it. Do you go with a broad &quot;it has it&#x27;s ups and downs&quot; or something like that? Or try to explain some specific part? I find this tends to bore people.",
