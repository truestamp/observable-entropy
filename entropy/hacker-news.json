      "text": "I am long time HN user, but this is a throwaway accout.\nI know this might sound a bit naive but after watching Russia bully the world and then launch a full-scale invasion of an independent country, I feel like I would like to do more than just donate money.\nI&#x27;ve been doing webdev for over a decade, and I have some fundamentals in web sec, but I would like to go beyond that. For example, I would like to confidently help smaller NGOs and political think tanks to fend off Russian&#x2F;Chinese&#x2F;etc cyber attacks and threats. \nWhat would be the most optimal way to self-educate in this are? I have some free time to invest, but not as much as when I was a teenager&#x2F;student and could play around programming and experimenting with technologies. This time it has to be more structured.<p>I would appreciate any ideas, but especially from someone who went through something similar.<p>Thank you",
