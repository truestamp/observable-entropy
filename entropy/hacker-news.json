      "text": "The great storm of 12&#x2F;21 in the Sierra Nevada range exposed (again) some nice map routing f&#x27;ups from Google&#x2F;Apple (probably more).  I recall article where a Google Maps engineer basically defended some of the routing f&#x27;ups and use of rural roads as a practical balance of something or other.<p>Living in California, you have http:&#x2F;&#x2F;roads.dot.ca.gov, and you have a shit ton of county websites with things shut down, local Sheriff and California Highway Patrol social media feeds giving a mix of X is closed from A-B and C is closed right now.<p>Formats, availability, lack of APIs are a thing.  Is anyone trying to solve this?  Where I spend most of my time, Apple and Google (despite many reaching out) were still routing people on a road that was seasonally closed .. barricaded in Sierra County, open to where they allow snowmobiles from Plumas County.  But still <i>closed</i>.<p>Apple and Google have the money and should be able to solve this at least Mechanical Turk style.",
