We are doing so using the power of NFC tags combined with the uniqueness of NFTs.<p>I&#x27;ve made a prototype. You can check it out on the website mentioned above or here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fHCxnHlQIjk<p>I would like to know the best possible way of reaching out to big footwear brands for demonstrating them the concept in order to tie-up with them.<p>Let me know if you have any other suggestions&#x2F;feedback as well.<p>Peace\nHammad Nasir",

Also I write fiction at my website.<p>For several years, I&#x27;ve made little projects on the web, mostly in PHP and JavaScript, for example: a game where people &quot;invest&quot; in subreddits like stocks [1], a reddit-like-commenting system [2], my own website [3], etc.<p>How could I transition to a remote web-developer job most effectively?<p>Coding boot-camp?\nCrank through job-boards and applications?\nGo through an online MS in CS?<p>My coding is not strong, but I can get stuff to work in PHP and JavaScript, and I can use web APIs fairly well. I&#x27;m lacking in skill and knowledge, but I hope to remedy that.<p>So, if you have a suggestion for how I might most effectively improve and hopefully even be remunerated, I&#x27;d be grateful to hear your thoughts.
