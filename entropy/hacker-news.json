Today we&#x27;re launching a new product release to the world and would love your feedback.<p>At Gretel, we build APIs to help developers create their own synthetic data to power their pre-production environments, or to train downstream ML models and tasks with artificial data vs. real customer data.<p>Our goal is to make data safer for developers by building privacy in to data.<p>Here&#x27;s our theory: With provable privacy guarantees comes community trust, and with trust comes the ability for us to share and collaborate with data more freely. With access to safe data, Gretel enables an ecosystem where it&#x27;s more about what you do with data vs. how much you have.<p>We would love your help and feedback to build a better product. Check out our release blog here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gretel.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gretel-releases-beta2<p>Or sign up and build a synthetic data set here!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;console.gretel.cloud",
