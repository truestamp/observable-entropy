So far I&#x27;ve spent most of my time with a C64: programming and learning different system quirks. Programming on these machines is really something else!<p>Right now I have my eyes on Acorn. Mostly because they were the first ARM&#x2F;RISC computers available in the market (to the best of my knowledge), but I would also love to hear other recommendations. I want to acquire something interesting, that would be challenging and rewarding to program with.",
