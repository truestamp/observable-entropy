      "text": "I created a moderately successful documentation tooling project in my 20s when I had more time and enthusiasm. It has been 13 years and the code base needs some love.<p>I don&#x27;t have the enthusiasm that I used to and additionally some large (multi-million dollar) companies are using it and I don&#x27;t know how to go about getting it properly funded. I&#x27;m only interested in doing the hard work to improve the code base and execution performance if it is funded.<p>I have created an Open Collective but lack the understanding of how to go about getting companies to contribute to it.<p>My current thought it to fork off and do the work in a non-commercial, source-available licensed code base with an optional paid commercial usage approach but I feel like that isn&#x27;t generally a well recognised option and I&#x27;m not sure why.<p>I love and respect open source in many ways but my attitudes to it have changed and I wish it was much more standard for maintainers to be funded but I struggle to know the best way forward.<p>Does anyone have recommendations on the non-commercial, source-available approach?",
