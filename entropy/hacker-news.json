      "text": "I work in a large infra organization at one of the big tech companies. I like almost everything about my job and I feel like the infra space is right for me.<p>But one thing I really don&#x27;t like is the social situation. Pretty much everyone in the org has a family and&#x2F;or isn&#x27;t interested in the social aspect of work. They are all personable and kind, but they aren&#x27;t there to socialize -- it&#x27;s just their job.<p>As someone who doesn&#x27;t have a family and is only a couple of years out of college, this lack of socialization has been pretty tough. I wonder if it&#x27;s this way everywhere or if big tech infra just attracts people who are working for the money, not for the whole experience like I think I am.<p>So I wonder: if you work in infra, does this resonate with you? How do you deal with it (or do you)?",
