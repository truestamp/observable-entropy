I have done a bunch of googling and I am at a loss to find resources that are more than just surface level. I have my own mental health issues but the depression I&#x27;ve struggled with in the past has always been something I&#x27;ve fixed by improving my life and prospects. So am at a loss as my poor partner is suffering terribly and has been for a while, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been a great help by just trying to fix things in our life and situation as it feels like I&#x27;m not really doing all that I can be.",
