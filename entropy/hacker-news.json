      "text": "Hey Everyone! Wanted to get some advice from the community - I&#x27;m currently a platform engineer and want to move into a more software development focused role and then into app sec in a few years. As part of my career dev plan, my manager approved me to attend 2 conferences this year, so long as 1 is developer&#x2F;app dev focused and 1 is app sec focused.<p>Are there any conferences that you&#x27;d recommend from your experience?<p>Thanks!",
