      "text": "Gmail is not Email<p>We were lucky enough to have a product idea that sold out immediately after some coverage on a few tech sites (A tiny hardware product for nerds).<p>Trying to update our customers, we sent out an email to about 500 people via Shopify, the spot the little guys use to do eCommerce. No links in the email at all, just a text based update that we’re here and working hard to keep up with demand.<p>Ever since then, every email we send to a gmail user (including friends and family) get’s bounced. It’s not even in their spam box!\n We have since added google dns txt records and via something they call postmaster tools and we still can’t get emails out.<p>Text only, no links, no phone number, just a product update from a small company.<p>Gmail is not Email anymore.",
