      "text": "Hi HN, I have about 8 years of Java-based software development experience in a variety of different companies. Unfortunately as of late I&#x27;m forced to confront the fact I really dislike the day-to-day of software development.<p>So much of the job just feels like doing the exact same thing over and over. You plumb some data from persistence to the UI (or back). That&#x27;s basically it. Each time there are some trade-offs to assess and technical decisions to make but in most companies it&#x27;s a fairly disempowered role. Even in non-CRUD code you&#x27;re basically choosing between data-structures, types of sort, what&#x2F;where to cache, etc. and it gets very repetitive. Not to mention it&#x27;s a very isolated&#x2F;isolating role where you can go days without human contact.<p>Ultimately what really interests me is the level above the boring plumbing part. Deciding what to build. Getting insights from users. For this reason it seems like Product Manager&#x2F;BA type work is more closely aligned with my interests. I think I&#x27;d be in a fairly unique&#x2F;advantageous situation for a Product Manager role due to knowing the SDLC inside-out having done it for years. But when I look at product jobs they all seem to require you to have previous Product Manager experience for 4+ years and there&#x27;s no real way &quot;in&quot; coming from software dev (or indeed from anywhere).<p>I saw Auth0 had a role for technical product manager (US only :&#x2F;) but nothing else suitable.<p>Does anyone have some insights on the feasibility of moving to product and how to get there?",
