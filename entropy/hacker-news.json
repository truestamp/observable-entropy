      "text": "Hey HN!<p>Excited to show off Yuzu, the stock market and Crypto API we wish we always had.<p>We built Yuzu to solve a problem we had while working on a prior project: current market data APIs are not built to enable rapid prototyping and scaling without a significant amount of upfront data engineering. In our previous app, a portfolio tracker, we had to ingest 30 years of historical data for stocks, crypto, ETFs, and mutual funds just so that we could re-expose that data to our frontend in a more efficient way. The number of API calls we would have had to make otherwise have made the app unusably slow.<p>This is why we built Yuzu to power frontend fintech use cases with a first-ever GraphQL API and unlimited streaming connections for live price data. We believe that you should be able to prototype and launch your app in days instead of weeks without building up your own data warehouse of market data. Just one API call to fetch everything you need and you&#x27;re off to the races.<p>The API is live now - use the code &quot;demo&quot; to try it out and sign up to get your own free API key for personal use.<p>We&#x27;re excited to show this off to the HN community - excited to hear your feedback",
