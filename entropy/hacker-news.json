      "text": "Currently I have a separate Ubuntu partition just for Vivado and it would be really convenient if I could use it with my main distro, Arch Linux.<p>I think that installing it directly on Arch would not be very wise from a stability point of view (and it requires some intervention to even install anyway), so I tried creating a systemd-nspawn container with Ubuntu in it. I could launch the Vivado GUI and generate a bitstream for a project easily this way, but the hardware server would not recognize the board plugged in via USB. This was a few months ago but now I want to use Vivado again and a lot.<p>Ideally I would like some advice on getting Vivado to properly interact with hardware from inside the container, if possible, but any advice on how people deal with Vivado&#x27;s tight OS requirements (besides sucking it up) would be appreciated.",
