To my surprise, I just can&#x27;t see the colors of the syntax highlighting. I manage to guess they are there, but I don&#x27;t actually see them as clearly as the Monokai theme.<p>I&#x27;m not colorblind (but my father is), so I don&#x27;t really understand why.<p>Do you have the same experience?<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oVDbu8lhqAA (french)",
