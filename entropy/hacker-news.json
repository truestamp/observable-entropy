      "text": "Hi guys, we are building a NoCode Platform for Web apps and in the initial feedback, few of our initial users have asked that if they can host the application themselves in their infra. Reasons could be due to data localisation issue or scalability&#x2F;security issues or may be they want to modify things later which cannot be done in the NoCode builder itself.\nSo just wanted to ask the community, is this something which can be a deal breaker for you if you have to use any NoCode Platform.",
