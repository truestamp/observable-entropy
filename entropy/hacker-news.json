Although we advertise on our web site, unless people are looking quite specifically, they are unlikely to find the adverts (unlike FANGs which would attract candidates directly).<p>Also, Recruiters tend to be a poor and expensive solution. It is hard to tell the good from those who just claim to be good and we get a lot of noise from them. Also, I&#x27;m not sure that the best candidates just call a random recruiter to find them a job.<p>What are others doing to both find jobs and to recruit?",
