      "text": "Hey HN, WordCrossing is a little game I made last week where you place words on a board to form a path connecting the start and end squares.<p>I was kind of surprised that even for a game of this scope, there was still a fair bit of complexity writing a map generator&#x2F;solver; which overall, made it a really fun project. I know there&#x27;s still a fair way for it to go, so I&#x27;d love any feedback you guys had to offer.",
