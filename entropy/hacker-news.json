      "text": "Ive been playing destiny 2 for about a month,i will continue to play it but will never spend a cent on it,because i dont like helping greedy companies like bungie,for an ftp game, i haven got any good content till now,everything is paid. The experience is limited,and because i wont pay there will be less destiny playtime for me,so im looking for another game to fill that time, so do you guys know of any good xbox games that are not pay to win?idc if the game is free or paid,what i care about is,when i play it,i wont feel that those with more money have an advantage over me in game. So whats your recommendations?",
