      "text": "I was looking for a multi-purpose laptop for some light gaming and also Android and Web development. I have been searching for a while, but with a tight budget, I finally found a gaming laptop with specs:\n- Ryzen 5 4600H\n- 16GB RAM\n- 512 GB SSD\n- NVIDIA GTX 1650 (4GB)\n- 120Hz Display\n- Windows 10<p>Now two things I didn&#x27;t like was the weight at 2.2kg and screen size 15&quot;.\nI&#x27;d have like to have a 14&quot; screen and weight around 1.5kg. There&#x27;s a kind of business variant of this laptop which has an Intel i5 11th gen chip without the NVIDIA graphics and costs around the same. The advantage is that is it is 1.7kg.<p>I have been primarily using Linux for around 2 years now, so I do plan to dual boot Linux at the minimum. So I am worried about Ryzen compatibility. Can the HN crowd please give your opinion on whether the specs is ok for my use or I should look at something else?<p>I&#x27;ve posted about buying a laptop before but my budget didn&#x27;t let me purchase it before.<p>The laptop I was looking at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.in&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B096SKGTCG&#x2F;ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_55E34DY0PP1WZ0NFG277",
