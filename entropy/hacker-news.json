      "text": "Standard work hours here is 9am-6pm, so 9 hours and I used to stay 10+ hours in the office often. before covid was another hour commute daily which meant pretty much not having any sun. New girl at work has a kid and told me she thought it was crazy staying past 3-4pm, and it dawned on me how right she is. pretty much everyone finished working by 7pm - many stores, restaurants are already closed before I even had a chance. Also after 6 hours the effectiveness or quality of work declines.<p>I got nothing against 4 day workweeks - I myself work part time, but I rather work 2-4 hours for even 6 days a week and I&#x27;d like to see this approach more popularized. Anyone else feels like this?",
