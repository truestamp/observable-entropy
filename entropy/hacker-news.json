      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m Zhiyuan Ju[1] from China, and since my graduation from university in 2019, I started contributing to the Apache APISIX project[2], and now it&#x27;s more like an ecosystem including API Gateway, Kubernetes Ingress Controller, and Service Mesh. Also, its community provides WASM and multi-language support (not only Lua ).<p>In the past 2 years, it grows very fast in China, that&#x27;s because it was born in China but donated to Apache Software Foundation after several months, now it&#x27;s the Top-Level Project in the foundation.<p>For now, we have user cases[3] like Tencent, Airwallex, Weibo, WPS, NASA, and so on. If you have any demands when using API Gateway product, have a try on Apache APISIX<p>As an Open Source project, contributors and Apache Software Foundation&#x27;s culture are the DNA of the Apache APISIX Community, let&#x27;s give  to our team![4]<p>[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;juzhiyuan\n[2] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;apisix.apache.org&#x2F;\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apisix.apache.org&#x2F;showcase\n[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apisix.apache.org&#x2F;team",

      "text": "I think in the eventual future Lego will render into a legacy brand when it becomes more possible to create compatible bricks. The company has had many cases against Mega Blok, Tyco and other competitors. Some were successful, but many others slipped by over patent expirations and loopholes.<p>A home 3D printer capable of producing compatible bricks won’t be around for a long time. However, what’s stopping thousands of independent online brands from using high end printers and operating through Amazon, Etsy, surviving all these years later, I think Lego is going to have a lot of bugs to squash. I know it’s a rough comparison, but we didn’t think the music industry would get carved out by independent artists in bedrooms. Because Lego has a Disney&#x2F;Nintendo brand leveled profile, they’re always going to be the highest quality.<p>I can’t help but predict a thousand no name companies from China manufacturing and selling fake legos on AliExpress.",
