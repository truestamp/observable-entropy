      "text": "Hello HN.<p>I am excited to share with you my new book, Bulletproof TLS and PKI. I&#x27;ve worked in this space since the very early days and SSLv2, always frustrated with the fact that the field is vast but the documentation poor. That first led me to create SSL Labs (which ended up being very popular) and then the first edition of my book, where I aimed to create everything a curious person needs to know about SSL&#x2F;TLS and PKI. Most importantly, it&#x27;s a very practical book where you can go to just learn what you need at that moment. I publish two chapters as a separate (and free) OpenSSL Cookbook.<p>The best part of Bulletproof TLS and PKI is that it&#x27;s a living book. There&#x27;s nothing worse than obsolete documentation! Because none of the traditional publishers were interested in that sort of thing, we did everything ourselves. The manuscript is in DocBook, I write using OxygenXML, my editor uses it as well, and there&#x27;s a nightly build process that generates everything. We can even show exact differences across versions, for example you can see that here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ivanristic.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;bulletproof-tls-and-pki-is-out.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ivanristic.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;bulletproof-tls-and-pki-...</a><p>I hope you&#x27;ll enjoy the book.",
