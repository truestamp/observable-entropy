      "text": "First of all I know that &quot;implementing your own cryptography is bad&quot;.  However, at some point, one does stumble upon a use-case that is not (well) covered by existing tools.<p>Now, assuming one has already done his due-diligence and has read (and hopefully understood at least the main ideas of) cryptography related RFC&#x27;s &#x2F; papers &#x2F; articles &#x2F; posts &#x2F; etc. (especially in the area pertaining to what one wants to build), and thus we can assume one is not a complete newbie in this mater, however, nor is he an expert.  Basically we can assume he is an &quot;amateur&quot;.<p>Where would one go with his design to ask for feedback about it, in the hope to at least eliminate some weaknesses that one (as a non expert) might have overlooked.  (I&#x27;m not speaking here about &quot;proofs&quot; or &quot;audits&quot;.)<p>----<p>More specifically ---- but please let&#x27;s not get into this right now, this being just an example ---- I&#x27;m trying to implement something similar to `scrypt` (the encryption utility, that uses the `scrypt` PBKDF, &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tarsnap&#x2F;scrypt&gt;) or `age` (&lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FiloSottile&#x2F;age&gt;), as a replacement to my current solution that relies on GnuPG.",
