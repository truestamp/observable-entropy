I sit at my desk fighting through my brain fog trying to find something I can focus on.<p>If I&#x27;m &quot;lucky&quot; something has gone wrong that needs my immediate attention [1], the small kick of adrenaline is usually enough to get my brain to wake up and I can continue being productive. By this I mean, solve problems, implement solutions, do the non-routine part of my job that I enjoy.<p>But having stuff break is not a sustainable method of waking up. If everything runs smoothly it can take an hour or two before the fogs clear. Even walking the dogs in the Scandinavian winter wakes me up sufficiently. I do of course use this time in some manners, read HN&#x2F;reddit&#x2F;blogs, write emails, meetings..  But I don&#x27;t do any &quot;real work&quot;, at least it feels that way.<p>So finally my to question<p>What do you do to jump start your brain in the morning?<p>[1] Bosses boss-boss decided that 24&#x2F;7 oncall is too expensive so 8-17 it is.",
