      "text": "Opinion: In the name of freedom, Western cultures are vehemently becoming anti-children and anti-family. Giving big support for abortions and rewarding homo relations, both go against having children and having natural families. They do this just to appease their employees and voters, disregarding their responsibility to think beyond votes, and blinded by craze for freedom. The craze has gone to abysmal levels such as people having freedom to choose or change their own gender.<p>Human progress is not about freedom alone. It is about playing your role assigned to you by the nature, by assigning a gender and family for you. It is about family as a creature, not you, the individual, as a creature. You can&#x27;t kill the bigger creature for the freedom of the smaller creature.<p>Hope the humans of the so-called developed countries get it.",
