      "text": "Sorry this is going to be erratic &#x27;cause I&#x27;m about to implode.<p>NOTE: Please don&#x27;t tell me to get a therapist. I&#x27;ll seek them out when I&#x27;m ready. There&#x27;s just too much to explain.<p>I don&#x27;t know when this started, but I&#x27;ve only become more aware of it in recent years, probably after I got out of a recent depressive episode.<p>Prior to that episode, I was probably under chronic stress and tension and low-lying depression. Since the episode, I feel like I&#x27;m at an entirely new stage of growth. I finally feel sane and have some emotional stability. But with this relative stability comes my anxiousness whenever I &quot;fall off&quot; this stability.<p>In general I feel like I&#x27;m almost entirely driven by impulse, or at least reactivity. There are obviously certain things I do routinely that aren&#x27;t impulsive, like going to work and making dinner. But outside of these routines, I feel like I&#x27;m constantly needing some sort of &quot;drug&quot; to keep me going. Often it&#x27;s some sort of hormone-hit from novelty or from getting validation&#x2F;attention.<p>Take for example when I started posting on HN a little while ago. Once I did a few Ask-HN&#x27;s, I couldn&#x27;t stop. Almost everyday (sometimes twice a day), I&#x27;d think of something to ask, and then desperately watch my posts to see how many people responded. The same goes for comments; I&#x27;d watch to see if anyone thinks what I said is smart or whatever. After a month I ran out of fuel and stopped posting here. But then my attention switched to Discord where I was beginning to make some friends. It was super exciting to be hanging out and chatting away with like-minds. Both HN and Discord made me really happy, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been this happy my entire life, to finally feel seen and validated for being a weirdo. But after the novelty wore off, and the chatting slowed, I find myself struggling again with this immensely painful feeling of emptiness. And the weird thing is, I&#x27;m friggin&#x27; 30 already. Not a teenager. And I have a very loving and supportive partner at home whom I talk with regularly.<p>Another thing about me that may be odd is that I barely consume any content. Very little social media, I don&#x27;t watch youtube, I don&#x27;t even browse the web anymore. And it&#x27;s not deliberate or through &quot;discipline&quot;: I&#x27;ve stripped these away over time simply because I don&#x27;t find them interesting enough. And, I&#x27;m almost too self-aware (or self-critical) in the sense that I think I&#x27;m wasting my time doing these things, so I stop.<p>The only thing I think I&#x27;ve had <i>some</i> &quot;success&quot; with, is some sort of intellectual exploration, reading up and investigating certain topics that I&#x27;m intrigued by. But even this was somewhat impulsive, because I could never focus on reading something I&#x27;ve planned on reading, but can only &quot;chase my curiosity&quot; in the moment. While not necessarily unhealthy, it&#x27;s not very constructive. But at least it&#x27;s more self-directed and not so externally-driven like the social activities on HN&#x2F;Discord.<p>Anyway, sorry it&#x27;s all over the place. I think my problem is not being able to find something that reliably provides the right kind and amount of stimulation and engagement. But I also feel that I may be setting the bar too high for these activities, being self-critical that I&#x27;m not using my time wisely. I also think part of the problem was looking too much to externally-dependent activities, like HN&#x2F;Discord. But I also don&#x27;t want to go back to isolation, like I had been for so many years.<p>I don&#x27;t really know my question, I just know I&#x27;ve got problems and no solution.",
