Then can be post-produced, but the core would be to simply record the call.<p>I want to start making podcasts for my DTC brand interviewing founders of burger joints, but, being a tech guy for me it&#x27;s easy, on the other side a burger joint guy may not be that tech savvy.<p>Make sense?<p>I&#x27;m interested in discussing ideas, and collaborations with anyone who&#x27;d be interested in working on this with me.",
