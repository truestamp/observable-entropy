From those two IP addresses, we have received 12,206,044 requests in June 2022 alone. In the last 6 months, the rate seems to remain relatively constant. It adds up to about 40GB&#x2F;month.<p>Each entry is this:\nGET &#x2F; HTTP&#x2F;1.1&quot; 200 4294 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla&#x2F;5.0 (ICANN IT Operations +1-310-301-5800)<p>Why do they request this page so often? I wrote to their &quot;ops@icann.org&quot; address several days ago but haven&#x27;t heard back. I know I could block them with a firewall but mostly I am curious as to why this happens.",
