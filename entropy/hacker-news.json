      "text": "I&#x27;ve been running my personal blog [0] on a selfhosted linux box (Hetzner server) for about six years. A lot less experienced back then, I opted for WP. But it is a hassle. I&#x27;ve tried making my site as lightweight as possible, but there&#x27;s a lot of functionality I just don&#x27;t need. I&#x27;m the sole author&#x2F;user of my low traffic site.<p>On the technical side - a large attack surface, constant security issues, themes randomly screwing up site access, lots of custom nginx rules to mitigate potential issues and make PHP play along nicely.<p>Content wise - the online editor is a HUGE pain. Probably the biggest reason preventing me from posting more. Also, I tried disabling the inclusion of external resources in the past, but a few days ago I noticed ublock blocking fonts.googleapis.com through my site. I don&#x27;t want any of this.<p>In short, I&#x27;d like to move my content to a new site, preferably something minimalistic, maybe static, with a small footprint and entirely self-contained. No more wonky WYSIWYG editing, constant security worries, MySQL&#x2F;PHP dependencies.<p>Some thoughts regarding migrating:<p>* Should I keep a list of deeplinks to my posts to integrate as nginx redirects so search engine hits still work?<p>* Are comments overrated? I&#x27;ve had just a few over the years, with mostly mixed relevance.<p>* Depending on the technology used, does it make sense to leverage CI&#x2F;CD? I&#x27;m already running a private gitlab instance for various tasks.<p>I&#x27;ve seen really beautiful personal pages linked on HN in the past. Are there recommendations or positive experiences with selfhosted sites?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jschumacher.info&#x2F;",
