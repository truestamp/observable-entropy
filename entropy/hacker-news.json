      "text": "At my current job my boss and I have been discussing a potential move for me into management. I am currently a technical&#x2F;functional lead but I find myself more and more dealing with “people” challenges and helping to unblock others rather than purely solving technical issues.<p>At this point I’m a little on the fence about whether becoming a full-blown manager appeals to me. I really like working on technical issues but at the same time I love being able to provide some leadership and guidance for those who need it. It would also give me slightly more weight when it comes to departmental decisions and high-level strategic goals which I do find appealing.<p>In general, I’m curious what the transition was like for most folks who moved from being an individual contributor to a manager. Did you ultimately end up loving it? Hated it?<p>Any advice and input is greatly appreciated!",
