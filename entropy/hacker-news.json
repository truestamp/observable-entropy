I&#x27;ve used SQLAlchemy in the past and I liked it, and I&#x27;m not sure how well it works with Django or if the Django ORM is as powerful. Though at the end of the day I just want a simple mapper and SQL query builder, not necessarily the super high level DSL.<p>2. How useful is the rest of Django when only the REST API parts are needed? Is it easy to disable the unneeded parts? Is it easy to completely remove them from the distribution (primarily for security concerns)<p>What would you recommend for an average Python dev team?<p>Some of the requirements:<p>1. authentication&#x2F;authorization with support for IdPs.<p>2. paging.<p>3. built-in security features preventing various injections and web attacks.<p>I know about Flask but it seems like a more barebones solution that has a longer ramp-up time, in order to find the right libraries that go together and make them work well.",
