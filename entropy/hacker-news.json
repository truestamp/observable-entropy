I would really like an open cellular mobile device that does not require me to use a bunch of apps or a bloated gui.<p>Here is my wish list. basic Xwindows,  a modern web browser, normal unix applications like xterm, xcalc, an application to make and receive cell calls, an application for text messages, the ability to take pictures, a OTP authenticator app, etc. I don&#x27;t want all the linux desktop bloat. I don&#x27;t want an app store. One if the things that is keeping me from buying a pinephone is supposedly the new phone is slow because it is so ovrbloated.",
