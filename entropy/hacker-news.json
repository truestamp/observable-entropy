      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on this product in various forms for 20 years. It&#x27;s never been a commercial product. It&#x27;s effectively site building (e.g. Wix or Squarespace) plus e-commerce (e.g. Shopify or BigCommerce) plus accounting (e.g. Xero or Quickbooks) in the one app. Whenever I&#x27;ve run a business that required e-commerce and accounting I&#x27;ve been frustrated by having to use 2 different platforms and subscriptions, so I intended to write my own. Unfortunately I have lost interest in coding (20 years as a working software engineer) and I&#x27;d like to either sell the code or give it to someone that has the means and motivation to take it to market. I have no interest in any ongoing royalty or ownership. If anyone has thoughts on this, people that may be interested, advice... I&#x27;m all ears. Thanks :)",
