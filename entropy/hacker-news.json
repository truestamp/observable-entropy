      "text": "Over the 4 to 5 yrs of being a health advocate (?) for a family member, I&#x27;ve witnessed a well-meaning but generally dated healthcare system. Aside from the ICU, hospital stays have been 75% transactional cookie-cutter diagnosis and 25% treating the patient (not just the symptoms). Outpatient? Mainly smart trained professionals effectively reading mindlessly from a script.<p>Futhermore, foundational health must-haves such as nutritional meals and quality sleep are consistently bad. How can you get well if these &quot;essential services&quot; are out of step with current science?<p>The experience has been both frustrating and dumbfounding. Is this all that will be?",
