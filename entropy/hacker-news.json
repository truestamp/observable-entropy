      "text": "Hello HN!<p>This is Atanas (twitter.com&#x2F;kozarev_atanas) working with<p>- Dr. Chris Williamson https:&#x2F;&#x2F;williamsonchris.com&#x2F; and<p>- Prof. Mark Ryan https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.bham.ac.uk&#x2F;~mdr&#x2F; Centre for Security and Privacy at University of Birmingham<p>On PAD.<p>We have released the beta of our API for PAD. PAD is a system which allows you to provide secure access to confidential information shared between two or more parties - you can share the ability to access a secret without automatically exposing the secret itself.<p>At the core of PAD is accountable decryption, which offers an alternative to transacting in complete openness or complete privacy. Anytime you need to encrypt and share a piece of information where the rules of who, when, and&#x2F;or how that information should be decrypted and accessed cannot be simply codified, PAD can help to improve privacy and oversight of the information.<p>To try PAD, please complete the short sign-up form [1]. We will provision you for the API as soon as we can, but we are a small team and this is a manual process so please bear with us if thereâ€™s a short delay.<p>See our developer documentation [2], and our launch blog post [3] for more information. In particular, some use cases for PAD are described here [4].<p>Feel free to comment here and, Chris and I would be happy to answer questions.<p>You can follow our progress on Twitter [5], and if you want to get more involved, we have also created a Discord server [6].<p>Best wishes,<p>Atanas, Team member at PAD<p>Chris, Privacy Researcher at PAD<p>[1] Sign-up form - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e4ufd97gowu.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;lJPnKDSr \n[2] Developer Documentation - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.pad.tech&#x2F;  \n[3] Launch blog post - www.pad.tech&#x2F;we-are-releasing-an-api-for-pad&#x2F; \n[4] Use cases - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pad.tech&#x2F;#use-cases\n[5] Twitter twitter.com&#x2F;padtech_team\n[6] Discord discord.gg&#x2F;qBRVf4Sxxw",
