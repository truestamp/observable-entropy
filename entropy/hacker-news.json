      "text": "Pretty much summed up by the title, but I frequently come up with ideas (products, podcasts, small apps, etc.) that I can&#x27;t realistically ever act upon.* They go in a document or on a list somewhere, or I share them with one or two other people, and that is about it. Does anyone have any kind of procedure in their workflow whereby they make use of these kinds of bits of thoughts? Do you send suggestions to people in the respective spaces? Just tweet them in to the ether? Let them go?<p><i>For the sake of argument, let&#x27;s assume they are at least &quot;ok good&quot; ideas and the reason I can&#x27;t act upon them </i>isn&#x27;t* because they&#x27;re fundamentally unactionable -- but I recognize that is possible too.",
