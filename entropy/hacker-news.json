      "text": "I value my intellect, but I&#x27;ve been rendered non-functional by OCD, anxiety et al. Strongly considering a medication, I now have a prescription for escitalopram 20mg.<p>I&#x27;m 27. For over four years, I&#x27;ve been in bed for 22+ hours of my day, browsing the internet from a smartphone. I went almost 3 years without bathing. I have not brushed my teeth in over 4 years. I feel like an old man when I get out of bed. I cannot perform the smallest &amp; most basic of actions without my OCD &amp; anxiety regulating &amp; controlling me.<p>With all of that, I still hesitate to try this psychiatric medication as I fear it will lead to some sort of permanent degeneration or alteration to my cognitive ability, which I hold highly without any good empirical reason. As a layman, I understand serotonin to, in general, bring relaxation and contentment with your situation, perhaps carelessness. I know that you must have a balance, but I don&#x27;t want to feel content with my horrible situation, and these do not seem like qualities that endow a personality which is motivated to and succeeds in solving hard problems and generally thinking critically through life, but more of the stereotyped apathetic, careless, and blunted &quot;zombie&quot; effect that echos with experiences I&#x27;ve already read.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that I could forgive myself if this medication neutered or sterilized my brain. It&#x27;s all that I have.",
