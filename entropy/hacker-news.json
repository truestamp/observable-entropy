      "text": "Hello HN! I&#x27;m working on a project that I want to scale and turn into a startup. While I do that though, I continue to work as a PM at a FAANG to pay the bills.<p>Leaving my job is not possible at this stage, so I&#x27;m wondering if people have any advice on how to make the most of my time here.<p>I&#x27;m non-technical, so are there any non-technical founder skills that can be learnt on the job? Is being a good PM enough prep for being a non-technical founder? And what about learning how to code? Is it wise to change roles and become a SWE? I&#x27;d think coding on the job would help with scaling my project when the time comes, but I don&#x27;t enjoy coding as much as I&#x27;d like to.",
