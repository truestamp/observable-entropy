      "text": "Hello, I have a static website that I want to do a couple asnychronous requests for data, used to render some data visualizations.<p>I could do it on the website&#x27;s javascript itself, except for the API keys needed to access the third party. So instead I&#x27;ll put the API keys on the server and get the data and serve the result to the website.<p>Heroku cost $25&#x2F;month. I can think of an AWS lambda + database that would theoretically be cheaper, or theoretically more expensive. But what would you guys use?",
