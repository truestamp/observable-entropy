      "text": "tl;dr What can happen if an American journalist flies to Russia and tries to interview Putin?<p>Lex recently interviewed Stephen Kotkin (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2a7CDKqWcZ0) who has really opinions on the war between Russian Ukraine.<p>For years now, Lex has been mentioning how he wants to fly to Russia and interview Putin, but recent political events, along with this interview, obviously increase that risk.<p>Lex continues to mention that he plans to fly to Russia. He has interviewed Vitalik Buterin, who met Putin back in 2017, a couple of times so I think it&#x27;s a fair assumption that he has a way to get connected to Putin&#x27;s team.<p>In my personal opinion, Lex has been doing a great job staying unbiased in his interviews, but if he tries to meet with Putin, is it too far fetched to imagine a Navalny type situation, except with an American citizen?",
