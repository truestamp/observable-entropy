      "text": "I don&#x27;t know if you have noticed that if you copy+paste into email pages&#x2F;apps like outlook and gmail they bring over all the formatting and styling of the source. That is, it pastes the text in with things like the font color and background color, and the font type itself, which then become the styling for the rest of the email if you keep typing as well.<p>Who came up with this? It makes absolutely no sense that anyone would want to transplant styling&#x2F;formatting into an email, where there is no guarantee (indeed, little chance) that it will  mesh well. It&#x27;s just baffling.",
