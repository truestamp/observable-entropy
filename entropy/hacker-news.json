If you have a great domain, think about how you can play around sub-domain.<p>People ask questions. How to start planning a wedding?\nTurns to: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;how.to.start.planning.wedding<p>First steps for planning a wedding?\nHere is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;first.steps.for.planning.wedding<p>And so on...\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;checklist.for.planning.wedding\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;the.ultimate.guide.to.planning.wedding\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;how.to.planning.wedding\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.am.planning.wedding<p>Of course, all these newly-created domains have a zero domain rating. But it can be used as micro landing pages that give specific answers in detail and gain authority. I heard exact match domains have some benefits for SEO.<p>So, my question will be related to brand building.<p>What do you think, is it possible to reach the words &quot;Planning Wedding&quot; as a brand itself?",
