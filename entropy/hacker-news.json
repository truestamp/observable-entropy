      "text": "Hi HN! For over a year we&#x27;ve been working on Kreya. At first, it only supported gRPC, because the alternative tools (eg. BloomRPC) were very limited in their functionality. Since then, we have added many features, trying hard to keep the UI clean while still supporting advanced use cases.<p>Yesterday, we released Kreya v1.8, which added support for REST!<p>In our opinion, Kreya is a good alternative to the existing tools out there. Sure, it may not support all the features that Postman has. But we think that Kreya has some innovative approaches (eg. authentication or API importers) that users may find interesting.",
