Our server delivers most of our outbound email directly to the destination servers, but, for various reasons, email from us to a few servers sometimes gets rejected. Up to now, the workaround has been to also have a Google G Suite account for our domain, and use the Google server to relay our email to those finicky domains.  With Google G Suite&#x2F;Workspace no longer being &quot;free forever&quot;, we are looking for an alternative relaying server. Volume is minimal, probable fewer than 10 relayed emails per day. Any suggestions appreciated.",
