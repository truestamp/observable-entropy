There are a lot of generic items but when you get to niche applications there are fewer.<p>I&#x27;d personally like to see a dataset for billiards. That would enable an AR app that helps you find shots. While a little morbid, I also think an active shooter dataset would be very valuable. Something from security camera angles to identify people with weapons.",

      "text": "After putting in over 100 hours on my two Elden Ring&#x27;s characters it dawned on me that FromSoftware could easily &#x2F; next move Souls into the MMO space. I know it&#x27;s common to compare E.R. to Breath of the Wild (and I don&#x27;t disagree), but for me this game feels more like Souls combat has been grafted onto WoW, in a good way.  The vastness, the exploration, the &#x27;holy shit&#x27; moments when you realize you just dropped into the wrong neighborhood (I ran Torrent right between TWO dragon&#x27;s in Caleid last night... oops). Yeah, I just get a ton of WoW nostalgia more than anything playing Elden Ring and it got me thinking about how a Souls MMO could actually work.<p>I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something FromSoftware wants&#x2F;needs to do, MMO&#x27;s (I think?) aren&#x27;t the huge money makers they use to be, but maybe the cost of building&#x2F;hosting such a backend isn&#x27;t as bad now that it&#x27;s a somewhat known&#x2F;solved thing(?).<p>Anyway... just taking a break and of course still thinking about ER too much.",
