      "text": "Patr is a code deployment platform that helps you deploy AND SCALE your applications with a simple, intuitive interface.<p>I started building this platform as a side project because of the huge number of deployments I had to make at my startup everyday. I quickly realised that this work could be easily automated.<p>I tried using other platforms like Heroku, AWS Beanstalk, Render, Fly.io etc; but most of them seemed either too complex to use, too expensive, or simply did not give me enough control over my infrastructure. I was looking for something that allows me to automate my infrastructure without tying my hands down in terms of flexibility.<p>Patr is my take on what a Platform as a service could be.<p>Disclaimer: It&#x27;s still in a VERY early stage, and might break here and there. I would love for you to try it out and share what you think about the direction that we&#x27;re heading in. If you have suggestions on how we can build this better, I&#x27;d LOVE to hear from you.<p>I am personally providing instant support to anyone using the platform.",
