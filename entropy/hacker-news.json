      "text": "Yesterday while using the Opera web browser on my late `09 Mac Mini (MacOS v10.11) to test a web app I&#x27;m working on I noticed a &lt;style type=&quot;text&#x2F;css&quot;&gt; tag referencing a file that&#x27;s not in my html code. Here&#x27;s a small sample of it of what was in it:<p>:root topadblock, :root span[id^=&quot;ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-&quot;], :root img[alt^=&quot;Fuckbook&quot;], :root iframe[src<i>=&quot;mellowads.com&quot;],<p>There are hundreds of URLs embedded in that file and not all are porn sites (but there are quite a few).<p>My first thought was I may have some malware on my Mac but after testing the app on Firefox and Safari and not seeing this issue I thought maybe this is a &quot;feature&quot; in the Opera web browser so I sent them a message via the bug report system on Opera&#x27;s web site. They replied with:<p>&quot;All bug reports are read and handled by our staff. However, please note that you will not receive a personal reply to the bug report, unless we need more information to investigate the bug.&quot;<p>Later on last night I did some searching for a file with that string above in it on my Mac and found one buried in one of the system folders named &quot;OperaEmbeddedBS.html&quot;. So this morning I responded to Opera&#x27;s reply email asking if that file is installed when I install their browser. So far I&#x27;ve not heard back from them but it&#x27;s only been a few hours.<p>I&#x27;ve also done some google and duckduckgo searching for both the file name and snippets of the content but didn&#x27;t find anything at all.<p>I&#x27;ve uploaded the file so others can check it out if they want:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ezinvoice.com&#x2F;OperaEmbeddedBS.html<p>The page is blank when viewed in a web browser so you have to view the source code to see what it contains. Here&#x27;s another longer snippet of it copied from a page loaded in the Opera web browser. I have no idea what this does. I&#x27;ve never seen CSS like it before but that doesn&#x27;t mean much because my CSS skills and knowledge are minimal.<p>Anyone have a clue about what this does, if it&#x27;s an Opera &quot;feature&quot;, or malware of some kind?<p>The only thing I can think of is it&#x27;s sending requests to the urls embedded in it, but I no clue why or what else it might do.<p>&lt;style type=&quot;text&#x2F;css&quot;&gt;:root topadblock, :root span[id^=&quot;ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-&quot;], :root img[alt^=&quot;Fuckbook&quot;], :root iframe[src</i>=&quot;mellowads.com&quot;], :root div[style^=&quot;padding: 5px 15px !important&quot;] &gt; [style^=&quot;width: 100% !important; cursor: pointer !important;&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;zergnet-widget&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;traffective-ad-&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;taboola-stream-&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;sticky_ad_&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;rc-widget-&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;q1-adset-&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;proadszone-&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;lazyad-&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;gtm-ad-&quot;], :root div[id^=&quot;ezoic-pub-ad-&quot;]",
