      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;ve built an appointment scheduling web application (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;schedulo.hsen.tech&#x2F;). The application has features to automatically create appointment time slots when the slot length and duration of a slot are provided. It also allows manual slot creation. I&#x27;m hoping to add more features down the line. This is currently in beta, so any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!<p>~ hasithsen",

      "text": "My Mac Air is close to giving up the ghost and I&#x27;m currently evaluating an M1 (16GB, 1TB) but somehow Apple&#x27;s recent moves is causing disquiet and am considering returning it (even though it&#x27;s actually not a bad machine).<p>So I need your advice on a developer&#x27;s laptop capable of running some flavor of Linux for under 2k. Back in the day the choice would have been simple: ThinkPad but there are all sorts of negative reviews regarding quality of Lenovo and I&#x27;ve been buying Macs for decades so I&#x27;m fairly clueless regarding alternatives. Many thanks.",
