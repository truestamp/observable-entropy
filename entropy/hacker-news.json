We also have accounts in AWS, Azure and GCP.<p>Ideally, we should be having a single system that manages user identity, authentication and authorization. I should be able to create a user in a single place and they get access to all of these in the right way and when they leave, lock out access from a single place.<p>I am wondering what do you folks use to create and manage the initial setup so that it is done right.",
