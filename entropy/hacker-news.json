      "text": "I&#x27;m trying to do a bit of research on compensation in software engineering, and I have seen some companies being open about their compensation. For example Monzo have their salary bands in their job descriptions (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;monzo&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;2578108). Others seem to take the transparent salaries approach (see Buffer: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buffer.com&#x2F;salaries).<p>I&#x27;m curious to know what other companies are doing something similar, do people have more examples of this? Thanks!",
