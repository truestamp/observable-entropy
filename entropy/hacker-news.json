The only two I can think of are:<p>Dereliction of Duty: HR McMaster - This was waaay too detailed for me. I got really bogged down and just strggled about 2&#x2F;3rds of the way through.<p>God Delusion: Richard &quot;Dickhead&quot; Dawkins - This was a gift to me. I made it a few pages in. I just got turned by his sense of rightness. I don&#x27;t believe in any god&#x2F;gods, but I don&#x27;t think that you can break down religious belief with logic. I don&#x27;t think it works that way.<p>So, what were you not able to finish?",
