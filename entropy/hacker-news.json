Not even speaking of search engines...<p>HN, what would you do in my situation?<p>PS: I know I should probably just focus on one thing, and make that work. The thing is, that&#x27;s what I did and it didn&#x27;t work. So I am trying to test if the second positioning of the product works better... considering a pivot.",
