      "text": "I want to get into a zone solving interesting problems. Sometimes that involves think deeply on research papers, practice algorithmic questions, writing on something, building a prototype, or simply allow mind to day-dream.<p>I gotta say, I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful at consistently doing any of these things. Then one time I went to a buddhist monastery for a weekend leaving tech behind. That was a revelation. Time to time I had the urge to look at phone I didn&#x27;t have, but soon felt like a blessing.<p>When I look at my computer, I see a device not designed to help me with these goals. I constantly check email, messages, read toxic forums which I guess is partly because of being alone and lonely. Hard to make friends after college. Seems impossible to make good ones.<p>I wonder what you think about getting my box in order.",
