      "text": "Hey HN!<p>I wanted to demo TDD with Python, as well as showcase some BDD practices I&#x27;ve been blogging about recently[1].\nSo I used literate programming to implement Wordle, and rendered the narrative into this &quot;Show HN&quot; webpage.<p>I&#x27;m certainly no Knuth, but I&#x27;m pretty proud of the result. Proud enough to chance myself to a HN post, and risk HN&#x27;s mockery and ire: my first &quot;Show HN&quot;.<p>I hope the HN crowd will enjoy this annotated walkthrough of Wordle implementation in Python. Codebase available on Github[2].<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jiby.tech&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jiby.tech&#x2F;</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OverkillGuy&#x2F;literate-wordle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OverkillGuy&#x2F;literate-wordle</a>",
