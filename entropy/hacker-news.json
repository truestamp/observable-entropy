      "text": "Video conference audio is terrible when half the team is in the same room watching on their laptops.  Can we improve this by getting all the devices working together on audio?<p>Proposal:\n1.  Discover other meeting participants in the room using audio signals:  Every laptop pings for other laptops in the room using a brief audio signal or short musical charm.  (I imagine this is similar to balancing a new surround sound system at home, but faster and less intrusive)<p>2. Determine potential audio interaction from each participant machine.  Using these audio pings, each device is spatially located and the relative impact for feedback to other local devices is determined.<p>3. Automatically manage microphone and speaker volumes for individual participation and reduced feedback in the conference room.  Individual laptop microphones activate when a room participant talks while nearby microphones and speakers automatically mute.<p>4. Use audio input local to the conference room participant for improved audio quality.  The best microphone is the one closest to the participant and it should be used whenever possible.<p>What other specs and features are necessary?<p>How do we get Teams, Zoom, WebEx, etc… to invest and adopt this technology?",
