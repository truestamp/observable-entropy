I don&#x27;t have much web dev experience though (mostly vanilla JS) but do have lots of mobile dev and backend dev experience in node js and bit of Rust.<p>Have you switched from native to cross platform dev?<p>Have you tried both flutter and react native?<p>Which one did you prefer and why?<p>Thanks!<p>Edit: I did start learning flutter yesterday and it seems pretty decent so far. 2 problems I do have are:<p>1. Too must nesting (which some say can be solved by breaking down everything into smaller widgets but seems like a lot of extra code work).<p>2. Flutter for web dev is absolute trash and useless as it seems to just draw the content using canvas instead of actually creating the html tree.",
