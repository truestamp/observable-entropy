Do front-end for living, have 2.5+ years of solid experience in various projects, all Angular (hate react and don’t trust Vue). Looking for a job in Ireland. Easily go through interviews, reach final stages and then I hear something like ‘We need someone with at least 3 YOE’, ‘Your experience is not quite aligned with our expectations’, etc. I‘m not familiar with hiring processes in Ireland and in whole Europe, could it be that they just don‘t say me a real reason?<p>My gut feeling is that they are afraid that I’m going back once the war is over. I clearly address this with the fact that anyway I never liked my country and people and planned to move to US in two years. Maybe they are not familiar with this new thing Temporary Protection Directive which entitles me to work in Europe at least for one year. I tell them that I won’t ask them to sponsor my visa in future.<p>I can happily provide any further details on demand. Any advice?",
