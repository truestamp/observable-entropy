      "text": "I’ve been thinking about the various methods &#x2F; philosophies of trying to understand things and theories.<p>I vaguely remember reading about 2 different philosophies, one where you just learn how things are understood today, e.g. to learn calculus you just learn it’s rules, vs learning the history of calculus and how it came to be in order to understand it.<p>Another example being learning about fire just through the theory of oxygen and combustion, vs learning about the history of fire such as the 4 elements and theory of Phlogiston.<p>Does anyone know the formal names for these 2 philosophies &#x2F; thoughts?<p>I may be mistaken but I also recall the Whig Interpretation of History and Kuhn’s theory of paradigm shifts being related. Is the school of analytic thought more predisposed to just learning how things are now in order to understand them?<p>On a personal note, I always seem to learn things &#x2F; theories better when I also learn about their history and how they came to be discovered and developed over time.",
