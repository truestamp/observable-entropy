      "text": "Folks, are any of you getting digitally enabled health care that feels efficient and modern? In the USA or outside?\nI&#x27;m in the US with a large managed health care company and after an injury this week felt like they aren&#x27;t really much better than any old independent practice.\nMy doctor said my ankle _might_ be broken and a podiatrist would reach out with a recommendation. I got a generic email from podiatrist asking me to schedule an appointment (podiatrist is with the same company 1 floor down. Next appointment is more than a week away). This seems nuts to me? I can imagine a very simple workflow tool that lets a doctor send some image&#x2F;test result to a specialist or a queue of specialists who take a look and give their opinion. How can a large integrated health care company not have something like that in place? Choose to behave like different offices that happen to share the same building instead?<p>Is anyone getting that level of digital integration and efficiency? Is this too much to expect?<p>Thanks!",
