MP3s are ok, although I would not mind FLAC etc.<p>I don&#x27;t want subscriptions, apps, recommendations, IA, PC apps, surround sound, IA or whatever, I just want to search for an album, pay and download what I purchased.<p>I was using Amazon because it gave me a .ZIP file directly after purchase, but now they made it horrible, forced me into logging into Amazon Music, which does not support browsers on Linux or mobile, and eventually (as long as it thinks some other browser is &quot;playing&quot;), only lets me download purchased songs one by one, from a very specific page which took me 45 minutes to find, and asking me every time if I really do not want to do it on their app.<p>I was wondering if there is a service out there that would just take my money and let me easily download the music in a legal fashion, similar to Bandcamp, but also for commercial artists etc.",
