      "text": "Hi there HN.<p>Aamu.app is an app that I&#x27;ve made and I hope to get some feedback.<p>It aims to have all the most important productivity tools (for companies) in one package. It will hopefully get more of those features in time, but currently there are already quite a few – tasks, docs, video meetings and so on.<p>Why did I do it? Because I thought the current ones were not that good, and I&#x27;m talking about things like Microsoft&#x27;s offering now. The different parts of their software were clumsy and they were not integrated very well into the whole – i.e. different parts were not designed in collaboration in mind.<p>I realize it&#x27;s quite a big app for one person to do, but let&#x27;s just say that I felt I needed to do and finish it. Couldn&#x27;t stop after I had started it.<p>---<p>Here&#x27;s an url you can try it without registering into it, and the usernames&#x2F;passwords:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;piper.aamu.app&#x2F;<p>username: richard\npassword: richard1<p>username: gilfoyle\npassword: gilfoyle<p>username: bighead\npassword: nbighead<p>username: dinesh\npassword: xxdinesh<p>---<p>The main url of the site: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aamu.app&#x2F;<p>Hope to get some feedback, thanks!",
