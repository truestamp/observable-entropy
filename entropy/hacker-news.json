      "text": "Recently with a group of friends I decided to start creating a web browser from the ground up using as few libraries as possible and I wanted to do it in C. I persuaded everyone to learn and start using C, because I personally had a sweet spot for C and I&#x27;ve seen many great applications written in C so I wanted to pay homage to the great developers who coded great software in C.<p>But none of us were familiar with C and graphical libraries such as Xlib and Cairo so it was and is a big learning experience for all of us. However, learning C and Xlib has become a massive hurdle for us. The problem is that C is a remarkably old language and the available learning resources are very old. Most of the information in books have become obsolete as standards and libraries have changed and and updated. The C communities have turned into ghost-towns with the latest posts being from several years ago. And worst of all, an unbelievably large chunk of C code on the internet cannot be compiled due to changes in standards and changes in libraries.<p>I think while it was a novel attempt to try to do the whole project in C with the bare minimums, it is very unproductive. It took out the confidence and fire in all of us so now I&#x27;m looking at some of the modern languages as a replacement for C. I still would like to keep it relatively low leveled and be in control. From my knowledge GO and Rust seem to be a modern take on C.<p>GO and Rust have caught my attention because they seem to have an active community, both allow the programmer to be in charge, and they perform quite well.<p>I&#x27;m asking you for advice and really like to hear your thoughts. Do you think Rust or GO would be suitable? Do you recommend other languages? What do you think?<p>I am interested to read your thoughts.",
