I tried to push for them since a year now, but there is also slight feature creep and a general lack of focus causing various other priorities.<p><i>How problematic is it for my career?</i><p>With my last job search I already felt inadequately experienced in that topic, even though I&#x27;m generally good at numbers and would love to track some stats.<p><i>What kept me away from metrics in my old jobs:</i><p>- B2B2C Startup 1: feature creep (made me quit), boss did not want to implement tracking. Did at least do qualitative testing observing users.<p>- B2B2C Startup 2 (freshly acquired): with low customer numbers, ever moving targets (ultimately made me quit again).",
