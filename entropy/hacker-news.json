      "text": "My recent experience coding makes me wonder about the possibilities of including a well-researched depiction of the genesis of a certain technology in a work of literary fiction. Is there any programming language, hardware revolutions, or companies that you think could work as a central element of literary fiction? These technologies run our lives, but I find them stunningly difficult to depict. I have to wonder if I am simply looking in the wrong place. I wonder how Tolstoy would write about today’s world and the forces that drive it.",
