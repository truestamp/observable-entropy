      "text": "Hey Hacker News,<p>We&#x27;re working on an investment aggregator that tracks the value of our customers&#x27; portfolios over time. We&#x27;ve faced a bunch of challenges in getting public stock market data (live&#x2F;historical prices, splits, etc). We&#x27;re currently cobbling together a dataset from a few different sources (Polygon, IEX, etc), but it&#x27;s been a massive pain*<p>I&#x27;m wondering if this is the case for other fintech devs. Does everyone face the pain of assembling their own financial datasets? Or do we have unique needs&#x2F;a bad solution?<p>So HN, where do you all source your financial data?<p>* Our main challenges:<p>Data quality: \n  - Ticker symbol changes (and CUSIP&#x2F;ISIN changes&#x2F;challenges)\n  - Missing or wrong values for some days\n  - Missing or incorrect splits\nSpeed:\n  - Tens of API calls that would be necessary to render one screen\n  - Historical data syncing that would take days of API calls\nBurden:\n  - Enterprise sales contracts instead of self-serve\n  - Building and maintaining your own ETL pipeline to ingest data",
