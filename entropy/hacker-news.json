      "text": "Hey guys,\nHello world,\nI was just wondering, if you guys face the same problem, or am I the only one with this problem.\nBasically, I find myself very difficult to get on-boarded or to on-board a new dev in a project. There are many challenges in it, like setting up multiple accounts for various tools around, like, a tool for\n- documenting business logic\n- API collection\n- db design\n- UI designs\n- store some important files, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve read this somewhere as well as I feel the same that, on-boarding takes almost 53% of a developers time.\nI wanted to just...share the pain and start a discussion around the same (it can be a rant too )<p>Also, is there any tool which can solve this problem of ours?",
