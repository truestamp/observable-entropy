      "text": "There&#x27;s much emphasis on data structures and algorithms in interviews and they&#x27;re an important part when getting a formal education in computer science.<p>But remembering my progress when learning programming, I started practicing not just by implementing sort algorithms and binary tree searches but writing actual practical applications. Simple games in the beginning, then more diverse stuff like book keeping, graphics, CAD &amp; simulation, client&#x2F;server stuff.<p>So what would your list of programs to write on the path from absolute beginner to reasonably able to apply the skill in practical context? Here&#x27;s mine:<p>1) &quot;Snake&quot; game ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Snake_(video_game_genre) ).\n2) Tetris game ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tetris ).\n3) (Microsoft) Paint program, excellent for OOP intro ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microsoft_Paint ).\n4) Ideally some sort of bookkeeping software with forms and a (relational) database behind. \n   In my days I actually used FoxPro, made forms definition very easy. I suppose nowadays this would be web-based?\n   But I&#x27;m leaving something much simpler for first web app, see #5.\n5) A forum web application ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PhpBB )\n6) A client&#x2F;server chat program ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Skype).<p>That&#x27;s a list from the top of my mind, I probably wouldn&#x27;t require someone to write ALL of the stuff above before considering them a programmer. But definitely, if they DO write all this stuff by themselves then LeetCode or not, they MUST be knowing their craft.",
