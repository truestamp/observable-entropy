      "text": "I have several flagshit laptops from HPE, MAC, 76...<p>ALL of them suck at peripherals.<p>SUGGESTION:<p>PUT SOME GOD DAMN USB PORTS IN THE TOP EDGE BEZEL.<p>I have USB(c) SSDs that I often need to plug in... Put some USBC slots on the top-external edge of the screen bezel.<p>Allow a small external enclosure to be velcroed to the top of the machine... Have it connect via a short USBC cable to the top of the screen&#x27;s plastic&#x2F;whatever enclosure...<p>So, I have these SSD enclosures :<p>this &quot;flagship&quot; OMEN from HPE has ONE usbc port (which fails to provide adequate power)<p>I have two additional AOC screens that require USB<p>I have a logitec that has a dongle (WhyTF isnt the logitec dongle integrated yet)<p>I run out of side port when doing work... (screens, storage, mouse, USB key, whatever...<p>We need a USB-C based hub along the top bezel of an open laptop screen.<p>I velcro the devices to the back of my lid with velcro stickers.<p>I&#x27;d rather have my post and wires on the top of my lid, than a bundle of bullshit in my laptop bag that I have to fumble with everytime I need to setup and get working.<p>Shittiest industrial UX. Ill provide pics if desired...<p>But the problem is that one CAN have a really amazing &#x27;battlestaion&#x27; style setup in a backpack for little cost...<p>but the core, the machine, is so lacking as the focus is on &#x27;GAME PLAY&#x27; instead of actual real usability in multiple market UX scenarios...<p>YES I game... but thats the core screen.... but I dev, and art, and build, and learn, and share, and zoom and blah blah blah...<p>and even a $3,000 laptop cant meet the needs of having a portable worktop experience, because of the ports issue.<p>I VERY DISLIKE the power 90-degree plug for all laptops.<p>The entire bezel&#x2F;lid of the monitor should have USBCs out all 3 edges. The power interface is so archaic it needs be retired, interchangable USB heads on cables should be standard. EVERY LAPTOP SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN WHEN THE DANG BATTERY IS REMOVED and power is supplied.",
