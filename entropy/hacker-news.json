      "text": "Tech recruiting and interviewing sucks. So I created https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rateyourrecruiter.dev&#x2F; to hold recruiters to account.<p>The elevator pitch reads: Interviewing for a role in a highly sought after tech company is broken. Recruiters have incentive to get as many people in for interviews, with little to none (or incorrect) information. Questions often have little to do with on-the-job responsibilities, and are rarely communicated to recruiting and back to the candidate.<p>By having a more transparent process is not only more equitable, but will lead to greater success for candidates and recruiters. RateYourRecruiter.dev aims at demystifying the recruiting and tech interview process.",
