      "text": "I&#x27;ve had two recent experiences that seem like a new frontier, at least to me. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has noticed this, or if they know who might be selling fake LinkedIn accounts backed by AI to apparently legit businesses.<p>A person working at a well-known devops vendor reached out to me repeatedly because my company is in the news. Then called me on my personal phone. I texted him back to stop and he was still quite perky and persistent. Eventually I realized I was dealing with an AI - saying something like &quot;Hey, &#x27;Scheduling a meeting with you today at 2pm&#x27; is a thing I would never agree to&quot;, would result in the schedule being generated. I ghosted on that meeting and then the AI pinged me again saying he was sorry he couldn&#x27;t make that meeting since his grandmother was ill.<p>Just this morning the same thing happened. I&#x27;m feeling a bit ill and against my better judgment agreed to a call with a recruiter who cold-emailed me. The job seemed relatively specific and tailored to my needs, and even included a salary range which would be a decent bump for me. The recruiter had a long history on LinkedIn, although they seemed to have switched industries from writing for travel websites to recruiting. Plausible. When I got on the call, the person was not &quot;Jason&quot; (who had reached out) but &quot;Jay&quot; who proceeded to say that Jason was too new, so he didn&#x27;t let Jason handle the actual calls. I asked why Jason wasn&#x27;t on the call; wouldn&#x27;t this be a great training exercise for him to shadow us? &quot;Jay&quot; started speaking slowly as if he was figuring it out in real time, and said &quot;...yeah, sure, Jason could join us, if you want... if he&#x27;s not on another call right now...?&quot; I terminated that call right away.<p>What the actual f?? What is happening out there?",
