      "text": "At the start of the pandemic, my girlfriend and I decided to work on a side project to keep ourselves busy. We ended up creating https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mynamefairy.com&#x2F;. It&#x27;s like a tinder for names. It&#x27;s been a fun project to work on, and its accomplished the technical growth goals that I wanted to get out of it (I learned how to do more modern css, how to setup a FE build with webpack, some vue.js, how to dockerize and deploy a django application, how to use postgres instead of MySQL), but at this point it&#x27;s been released for over a year and gets maybe 1-2 people a day. Those people are spending time on the site (avg time is 4 minutes, some spend up to 30-40 mins per session), but there just aren&#x27;t very many of them.<p>I&#x27;m not so much interested in trying to monetize it (although that would certainly be nice), but it&#x27;d be great if we could get more people using it. I&#x27;ve shared it on a few of subreddits. (r&#x2F;django[1], r&#x2F;python[2], and r&#x2F;webdev[3]). When doing so, I tried to balance the self promotion aspect with information about which classes I took and found useful, tools I worked with, and various lessons along the way. Those posts did provide a nice little bump for about a week or so, but traffic dropped again afterwards. At this point we&#x27;re trying to brainstorm what would be the best use of our energies to try and get more people using the site.<p>Some ideas we&#x27;ve had:\n* Focus more on SEO. If I google &quot;tinder for names&quot;, we don&#x27;t even show up. A lighthouse test gives us 100%, but clearly that&#x27;s not a good enough benchmark for how discoverable we are. We&#x27;ve even thought about paying some SEO expert to help, but so many of the services we find seem scammy.\n* Try and find more parenting&#x2F;expecting mom forums online and posting there.\n* Trying to find places around town we could leave flyers (we&#x27;re based in Amsterdam).\n* Just keep on hammering away at features to try and make the site more useful&#x2F;compelling.<p>Has anyone else faced a similar quandary and, if so, how did you go about getting more exposure for your project? It&#x27;s still just a hobby, but we&#x27;re willing to pay a bit of money if it helped us get some traffic and momentum on it again.<p>1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;django&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kync31&#x2F;side_project_i_built_using_django_and_what_i&#x2F;\n2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Python&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kz8uxu&#x2F;side_project_i_built_using_django_a_tinder_for&#x2F;\n3: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;webdev&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l3dior&#x2F;side_project_i_built_using_django_a_tinder_for&#x2F;",
