      "text": "Hi HN!<p>In recent years I’ve grown weary of working for large companies and have longingly looked at taking up either bigger roles in smaller firms or launching something myself.<p>I am, however, burdened with imposter syndrome and seemingly always tending towards IC roles where I can hide away.<p>I have technical knowledge. I’m a seller. I’ve digested plenty of books on the intersection between business, innovation, technology, and organisational psychology. I have recruiters calling me daily. And I’ve worked with some of the biggest companies on the planet but I cannot overcome the feeling that I shouldn’t be <i>there</i>.<p>When I’ve tried to push myself above the parapet in more personal-centric pursuits (e.g. posting to social media to develop my presence, or launching internal campaigns) I feel physically sick and often succumb to feelings of anxiety where I’ll either stop working on something or sabotage it. At current I find this is limiting my progress  and my ambition of taking on positions of leadership.<p>So, HN, my question more specifically is - how do you combat imposter syndrome, and are there any techniques that you’ve used to reduce it’s impact?",
