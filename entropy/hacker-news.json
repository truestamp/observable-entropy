      "text": "I&#x27;m to start with a new company in EU&#x2F;Greece and they asked for high school diploma amongst other paperwork.<p>The position is Senior SW Dev so this seems pretty ridiculous to me. Question is whether this is a red flag for the place altogether. I keep thinking what kind of place asks a 40 yr old senior dev for  such a paper? This feels like a no substance place where senseless bureaucracy is running a tech org. Not a good sign...<p>What do you think?",
