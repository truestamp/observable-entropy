Leading and trailing whitespace is allowed for a folder name and git respects this. Github and GitLab will both render the full folder name in the DOM but don&#x27;t escape it with `&amp;nbsp;` or use the `white-space: pre` [1] CSS property (TIL) which leads to whitespace collapse. Interestingly the tooltip on Github shows the full name but not on GitLab.<p>To me it&#x27;s another example of how difficult it is to anticipate the full space of user input.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;white-space",
