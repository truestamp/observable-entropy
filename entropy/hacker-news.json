Apart from modern technology like Bluetooth - most of them existed 20 years ago!<p>But looking the length alone of the list of features I don&#x27;t want to pass on fill my mind with hopelessness nowadays:<p>[ ] lightweight &#x2F; has a clip<p>[ ] plays from filesystem<p>[ ] supports resume from last played for large files (must have for audiobooks)<p>[ ] support for at least OGG and FLAC next to MP3<p>[ ] auto-connects to BT headset<p>[ ] equalizer or at least bass&#x2F;treble control<p>[ ] playback modes (continue alphabetically, shuffle, etc.) (no - not obvi<p>[ ] auto-off after N minutes<p>[ ] display easy to read in sunlight (why not e-paper?)<p>[ ] support for firmware updates (I don&#x27;t dare to ask for open source..)<p>[ ] nice: audio jack for analog headsets<p>[ ] nice: support for multiple (2) bluetooth headsets<p>I know today it&#x27;s profitable to throw cheap crap on the market - most people will just buy and forget. But what&#x27;s with those who&#x27;d like to spent quite some money for a quality product? Do they have a chance to search nowadays?<p>How do you do it? Just with standard search engines and endurance? Reddit? Special keywords? Are there reliable platforms for product recommendations?
