      "text": "I am a long time Django dev, I have been for ~8 years now. I am also a contractor and have been so for roughly the same period. Every time I have moved from one client to another, it has been a recurring theme that there are some (many) devs in the client company who consider Django &quot;bloated&quot; - yes that exact word has been used to describe Django - but few if any can quantify or even identify the &quot;bloat&quot;. I realise I am not an objective observer on this matter, I like Django and I like DRF even more so. \nSo I am hoping some folks here at HN can shed more light on the subject of Django&#x27;s bloat? For the sake of simplicity, let&#x27;s confine the discussion to comparisons with other Python web frameworks such as FastAPI, Flask, bottle etc",
