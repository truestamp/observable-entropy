      "text": "Say you have a podcast and you want your listeners to send you voice messages.<p>The only available options are:<p>- listeners call you via phone (costs them money, very high prices for international listeners);\n - or, users record themselves on an app, attach the file to an email and send you the file (very cumbersome, high risk of failure due to file size, format, ...).<p>I didn&#x27;t like these &quot;solutions&quot;: they both introduce a very high frictional process to listeners and, for me, are a huge PIA to manage.<p>To fix this whole situation, I built <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mono.tn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mono.tn</a> (read: monotone). It&#x27;s a simple tool to allow listeners, wherever they are, to easily send me voice messages.<p>Now, it only takes three taps (or clicks) on their phone (or computer) to complete the whole process. And I have a single place to manage all the messages I receive.<p>I&#x27;m curious to know if people other than me would find this tool useful?",
