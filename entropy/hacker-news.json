      "text": "I had some time of work and I was really looking forward to get some work done on a private project. But once I actually sat down and started it felt like a chore and I stopped shortly after I started. I tried again but in the end I got nothing done and just left it alone for my time off. Now back at work (programming) I get the same feeling again. What once was such a fun and intresting activity for me has been reduced to a feeling of dreed everytime I have to do it. This has been going on for a while now. Did this ever happen to anyone else and how did you handle it? Is there a way to regain the love for coding?",
