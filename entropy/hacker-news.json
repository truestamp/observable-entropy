      "text": "I have an 8 year old boy who wants to chat (txt, voice, video) with his friends online, so they can arrange to play games, etc. I&#x27;m not keen on giving him a mobile phone yet and a lot of the platforms like Discord, Slack, etc don&#x27;t have much in the way of parental controls. Ideally I&#x27;d like something where I (and the other parents) can supervise, moderate and control who has access to the groups and which groups the kids have access to, without having to worry about what other content and people on the platform they could be exposed to. I don&#x27;t have a problem with self hosting, if that&#x27;s the best option. How have others in the Hacker News collective approached this?",
