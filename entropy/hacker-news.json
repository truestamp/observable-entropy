All the renewal notices had been going to Scott&#x27;s old YC email, which no longer works.<p>Dom runs <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlewarden.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlewarden.com&#x2F;</a>, which monitors sites for upcoming issues and lets you know when you&#x27;re about to publicly embarrass yourself. In a twist on eat-your-own-dog-food (eat someone else&#x27;s dog food as a community service?), he had set up alerts for HN in their system. Lo and behold, it delivered the goods, and that is why you&#x27;re reading HN as usual today, instead of certificate expiration scoldings, and therefore also why my ass is in a saved state, which is how I like it.<p>I figure the least we can do is proclaim our thanks, so all hail Dom and Little Warden! Yes, I know most of you can do this in 3 lines of Python and a cron job, and yes yes, there are other alert services—but only one has personally helped you waste time unimpeded on the internet. That is all.",
