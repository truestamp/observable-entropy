      "text": "After waking up, the next thing you want to do is outdoor walking in a large environment to generate a so-called “optic flow”. Morning walks help reduce the amount of neural activity of the amygdala in your brain and thus decrease anxiety. Forward ambulation also activates many brain areas and is particularly important to push your neurology in an alert and focused direction.<p>If you feel sleepy in the mornings, walking helps you get to a high degree of focus. Also, getting sunlight in your eyes (even if there’s a cloud cover) first thing in the morning is vital to mental and physical health. It is perhaps the most important thing to promote your hormone system’s metabolic well-being, positive functioning and get your mental health steering in the right direction.<p>Morning walks and bright lights are also helpful to push a natural bump in the cortisol hormone. You’ve probably heard that stress and cortisol disrupt the immune system, but not the short little pulse of cortisol that you get each morning. This cortisol pulse must arrive early in the day — it is the right way to promote wakefulness and a healthy immune system.<p>Two minutes without sunglasses would be a minimum, 10 minutes would be even better, and 30 minutes would be fantastic if you can. If you wake up before the sun comes out, it’s okay to turn on artificial lights, but then you would want to get outside as soon as possible to bring natural light stimulation to your eyes. To achieve the magnitude, you want to do it every day at the same time. And doing this each day costs nothing. It’s just time.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prdikt.co - closed beta launches Feb 29, 2022",
