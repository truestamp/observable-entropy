I have used python to write small scripts to do small things like automation and stuff but honestly writing (or even working on) big projects seems terrifyingly arduous to me.<p>As far as I have seen almost all jobs related to Python are either back-end development using Django or something related to data.<p>Considering I like neither of those, is there any other careers I can pursue? Especially if it involves writing many short script! I know there must be other jobs out there related to Python but the number of those seem to be really low and hard to find.",
