      "text": "The simplicity of the Hacker News UI is one of its charms, but viewing HN on a mobile, fairly often I end up accidentally hitting Flag or Hide when I&#x27;m simply trying to open an article link or go into the comments. Then there&#x27;s that moment of &quot;did I hit the wrong thing?&quot; followed by the usual scrabble about to undo it (since I don&#x27;t want to flag stuff inappropriately!)<p>What I wondered was whether it&#x27;s really necessary to have the Flag &#x2F; Hide links there in the main list view at all, especially when for most users they&#x27;ll be used comparatively much less often than the other links (either to the article or to the comments). If they were hidden in the list then it would avoid the risk, and people who are genuinely flagging items can easily do it from the header of the comments page, which often will be where they&#x27;ve been anyway (eg if they check out what others have said before flagging)<p>What do people think? Needless change? Potentially helpful? Something to put behind an option? (so UI traditionalists keep it unchanged and optimisers can tweak it as desired)<p>I realise that on a full computer, one could use a grease monkey script &#x2F; custom plugin for this kind of thing, but on mobile that&#x27;s not really an option. Nor is zooming to increase the text size as it then loses content off the edge (on mobile Chrome at least)",
