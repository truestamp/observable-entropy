      "text": "So I created a platform that allows users to create interactive audio books &#x2F; meditations. To be honest I just really wanted to build something that came to my mind during the pandemic and as such ignored releasing it to the world and instead focused on tech &#x2F; redesigns. It&#x27;s been an on&#x2F;project for a couple years now.<p>The idea is that it:<p>1) Provides a studio to create interactive meditations &#x2F; audio experiences. Currently supporting sounds, images and narrations.\n2) Provides a journey player to allow multiple templates to be joined in a decision tree and hence have an interactive experience. Currently navigation can happen through buttons on the screen or via voice commands (which is a little dodgy given I use browser APIs).\n3) Provides an audio player and sprites in the frontend, which allows you to mix and match narrations&#x2F;sounds&#x2F;images on any articles to customise the experience. You can also equalise sound levels for narrations&#x2F;other sounds. Finally, and most importantly IMO, you can add plugins to support things like vibration mats, lighting, etc. \n4) Captures user session content, such as the users pulse during a meditation, user journals when answering questions, and again plugins to allow you to capture more data.<p>The main issue I have now is sort of the sunken cost fallacy. On one side I&#x27;m still sort of passionate about it, but I really don&#x27;t have the know how to get this to market, and I feel like I should just take a step away and work on something else with all the knowledge gained and focus on a smaller idea. On the other, it&#x27;s a pretty advanced platform and I feel some form of keeping it alive would be amazing. I just don&#x27;t want to opensource it given the insane amount of work that entails (from my previous OS experiences).<p>Just felt like mentioning, and seeing if anyone has any input or perspectives I might be missing?<p>The website &#x2F; app is at enjamon.com",
