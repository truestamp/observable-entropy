How do you manage to stay relevant or explore new concepts?<p>How do you manage to explore despite being tired after your entire day of work? I am in similar situation where I would like to work on my graphics projects, but I after a long day of work, I lose the will the to stay focused.<p>Therefore, I would like to hear your opinion about it! Since most of the posts in HN float around web development or software engineering, it would be refreshing to see graphics content. Feel free to share your opinions and methods.<p>Thank you for you time!",
