      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m considering jumping into a startup under as Director&#x2F;CTO for a post-revenue, seed-backed (including seed bridge) startup. This would be their first full-time tech hire. They&#x27;re offering pretty competitive salary but I&#x27;m wondering how much equity I should negotiate for. They have an MVP but want someone to come on and actually build a scalable (greenfield) platform in anticipation for a Series A next year.<p>A bunch of stuff online says from 3-5% typically for a first tech hire, but if I&#x27;m going to be building a majority of the platform (notwithstanding a couple senior&#x2F;junior hires as well), should I negotiate for more?",
