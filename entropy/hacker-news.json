      "text": "So I&#x27;m a completely new developer, only recently started my first job after a career transition. One thing I&#x27;ve realized is that I&#x27;m quite bad at actually planning and understanding what I want to build.<p>For example, around May 2021 I began working on my own toy rendering engine in C++, in part following learnopengl.com. I got to as far implementing my own batch rendering. But I feel like in terms of actually understanding how to architect (is that even an appropriate term here?) my code, in terms of what classes I want for my features and how I want data to flow, I&#x27;ve not really done much of that. I&#x27;m not too sure where to start.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate hearing from more seasoned developers about how you begin planning your hobby projects. Right now at work, I&#x27;m learning Java and one of the things we learnt was how to use UML diagrams. But is this what people do normally for their projects, or are UML diagrams old fashioned?<p>Any tips&#x2F;resources welcome! :)",

      "text": "I need improve programming skills in multiple languages(4 of them), in the past I focused on one language for 1~2 weeks then switch, however by the time I return I forgot many nice details already.<p>Then I tried to spend 1 hour on each daily, that context switch seems not working very well either.<p>What&#x27;s the best approach to master them together? In the project I work on I need use them whenever a feature&#x2F;bug that needs attention.<p>Each language has its own ecosystem&#x2F;modules&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;communities and is quiet demanding alone. I don&#x27;t want to get burned out, meanwhile the product does require me to be competent on them all.",
