      "text": "I know what I&#x27;m asking. To the extent I&#x27;ve researched it myself (10 years ago), all I&#x27;ve seen is pseudoscience. But when I see stage performances like this [1], I can&#x27;t help but think &quot;well, clearly this works on a small subset of people!&quot; One might argue, that that&#x27;s the trick, to get highly suggestible people on there and that that&#x27;s why it works. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple, but more importantly that could be researched [2, 3].<p>When I look at videos like [1], I clearly see problems with the explanation of hypnosis. It is apparently the same as REM sleep, yet no studies were cited. I mean, it sounds plausible, but a lot of things sound plausible (true and untrue things). In other words, hypnotists aren&#x27;t scientists. When it comes to the human mind, the best scientific role we have are psychologists.<p>Did anyone on HN do some research on this? I&#x27;m asking you, because I&#x27;m dreading that Google would show me 10 websites with nonsense for every 1 website that has a small scientific result.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1RA2Zy_IZfQ<p>[2] IMO such a thing should&#x27;ve been researched, wouldn&#x27;t it? Get a control group and a normal person (claiming to be a hypnotist) performing a hypnosis routine without any hypnosis tricks, then get an experimental group with a hypnotist. Let them perform certain tasks and see if there are any strong differences in the suggestibility of people. If there are, then it&#x27;s easy to isolate that hypnosis isn&#x27;t just filtering out highly suggestible people. It simply suggests that it&#x27;s one of the tricks they apply, but what are the other tricks?<p>[3] I&#x27;ve experienced a thing or two with meditation that seem to be related. Whenever I meditated getting into a trance or whatever they call it was never ever the point. Yet, I&#x27;ve been in emotional states that were very unusual and interesting. I experienced the same thing with exercise. So it seems plausible that more could be going on (but IMO that&#x27;s not enough evidence, scientific research is needed).",
