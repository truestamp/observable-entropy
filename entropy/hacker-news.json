      "text": "When you are pursuing a goal that takes a very long time to reach, how do you stick with it?<p>After the honeymoon phase, there are no more surprises, no more mind-paradigm-changing knowledge, not that much growth.<p>Just a slow, no-end-in-sight slugging for what seems like forever.<p>Especially when you are alone and it does not provide you with immediate rewards like money or praise. Or you don&#x27;t get paid to do it.<p>I find such situations very difficult and often quit. (This did cost me multiple times in the past.) But I don&#x27;t want to. I want to stick with something for a long period.<p>How do I do it? Any advice or book suggestions?",

Let us know if you find anything?<p>Again, here&#x27;s the link to our private beta - and please don&#x27;t hold back!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstx.ai&#x2F;private-beta\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstx.ai&#x2F;private-beta</a>",
