      "text": "Much has been made of the move to remote teams, especially after the coronavirus pandemic. The pros and cons of remote teams are hotly debated, and their impacts are especially relevant to startups.<p>Remote work’s benefits to startups include hiring competitiveness — engineers increasingly prefer remote work, and more talent is available by considering remote employees. However, in-person work arguably enables more effective collaboration, spontaneous idea generation, work ethic, and creativity — items which are of top priority to startups where every bit of increased productivity and performance makes the difference between success and failure.<p>While I of course do not expect any conclusive decision either way, I want to open the floor to debate on this topic. What, to you, is better — building a startup remotely, or in-person?",
