I have read a lot about new things like esbuild, Vite, Nuxt, and many more, but between my 3 kids and full-time job as a developer I have almost no time to learn them, and choosing &#x27;what&#x27; to learn often feels overwhelming because of how many things are out there.<p>If I don&#x27;t keep up I feel like I&#x27;ll soon be irrelevant. Is it just me, or do other people feel this way as well?<p>I suffered some extreme burnout a few years ago so perhaps I just don&#x27;t have the drive anymore.",
