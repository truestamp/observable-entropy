      "text": "I&#x27;m from Costa Rica. With a background in technology, international business and CS. I am aware of the very high number of tourists from the USA, England and France that our country receives every year. I have the idea of   developing some vacation homes on a property 5 minutes from 4 beaches, overlooking the sea, that a friend is selling at a very low price. With $500k we could buy the land and build at least 2 medium houses, with luxury finishes and fully equipped to rent to vacationers or sell them.<p>The idea is to create a token and that people in the crypto community can buy it to participate in the profits in the future. For example: 1,000 tokens of $500 each, if someone buys 20% of the total issue, they participate in that same proportion of on capital gains.",
