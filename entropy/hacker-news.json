      "text": "Oh Gina, Gina, dear Gina Trapani, you had great idea to keep tasks in plain text files and organize them with small shell script (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;todotxt.org). But through the time that &quot;simple script&quot; became a monster: 1349 sloc. One thousand, three hundred fourty nine lines of code in the shell script.<p>I wrote really small script that can respect the simplicity of todo.txt, has colors and couple of new really little improvements that I found useful: pinned tasks and sorting by &#x27;due:&#x27;. The script is 33 lines of code. 33 lines, Gina, not 1349. Simple stupid.<p>You can check it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;asakura42&#x2F;todo.sh<p>What do you think? Can todo.txt still be good solution for some tasks?",
