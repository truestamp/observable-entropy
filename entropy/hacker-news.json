      "text": "For reasons purely born of intellectual curiosity, I&#x27;d like to build a homelab.<p>But, I&#x27;m kind of stumped on what to do with it. Like everyone else, my house is pretty well connected to various different cloud platforms for things like streaming and music. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that a homelab would be a tangible improvement in ways other than things like privacy, but maybe I&#x27;m just unaware. I hear of people running K8s clusters on their homelab, which, while being overkill, I could see as a fun hobby project, but I&#x27;m just not sure what the actual purpose would be.<p>Is there anything you can do with a homelab that doesn&#x27;t have an ergonomically superior cloud alternative? Perhaps the way I have stated that question is a tad too subjective, but I&#x27;d definitely love to hear why I&#x27;m wrong -- especially if the argument extends beyond the obvious things like not using a proprietary service or privacy concerns.",
