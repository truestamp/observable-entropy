      "text": "Hopefully it&#x27;s not against to the HN rules, but there are two questions at once:<p>1) how to restore Google Workspaces account (email) (yes, they are already deleting&#x2F;closing those, but advertised deadline was 1st June) [1]<p>2) best self-hosted alternative (Dockerized solution sounds nice)? I&#x27;m happy to pay 10$&#x2F;mo for VPS provider, instead of Google, who could delete your stuff in random moment<p>As in understand, there are many people who are trying to leave Google Workspaces ASAP<p>Cheers,<p>[1] &quot;Account deleted. This account was recently deleted and may be recoverable. Click Next to attempt to restore this account.&quot;<p>- Tried to get contact with support multiple times, no luck so far with recovery, you can just ignore that message.
