We would ideally like to pay for services weekly in advance, rather than arrears, to assist with immediate cash flow needs.<p>Does anybody have suggestions on the best way to provide payment? I understand Ukrainian banks are still up for now, so are wire transfers the most reliable, or should we use visa&#x2F;master card e-gift cards? Something else?<p>Aside from the &quot;who is hiring&quot; posts tomorrow, are there any boards or services we should be posting to?<p>Thank you!<p>David Greisen\ndgreisen@openlawlib.org",
