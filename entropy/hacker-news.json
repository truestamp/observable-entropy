      "text": "We&#x27;re your typical run-of-the-mill mid-size enterprise software vendor trying to hire for &quot;DevOps&quot; (Linux, containers, yadda yadda) fully-remote SWEs. We post in the usual places including Who&#x27;s Hiring but we haven&#x27;t even managed to backfill a retirement from six months ago, and we&#x27;re junior-heavy already. Benefits and salary are good, and the people are great, though the work requires a reasonably deep understanding of the underlying platforms which a lot of people seem to dislike.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if the work being a higher percentage non-code is what&#x27;s causing us trouble, if we&#x27;re just rubbish at hiring in general, or if it&#x27;s something else.<p>What&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s experience hiring senior talent in this market, and what is everyone doing to attract seniors to their roles?",
