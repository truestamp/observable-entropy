      "text": "Hey everyone! As the title says, I made a [financial data  web app](www.trackerelite.io) that empowers the next generation of investors.<p>For example, We democratize intangible asset data via our web interface. You can access our data on B2B Rights, Brand, Relationships etc that can be protected by Intellectual Property and that drives stake holder Value.<p>I started working on this a few years ago, with the idea that Intangible Assets are the next generation of stock market data. Our platform which is in beta, solves many issues for us and for other people investing in today’s culture. It’s personally has helped drive my portfolio up 700% in the past 3.5 years.<p>I am curious to hear any feedback on the idea but also what we can implement to make the app more useful.<p>Link to the landing page (www.trackerelite.io)<p><i>Subscribe on our site for updates and potential early access to our beta  </i><p>PLEASE UPVOTE SO OTHERS CAN SEE THIS INFORMATION",
