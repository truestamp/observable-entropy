      "text": "I&#x27;m at a bit of a loss. Just wanted to ask the community if there were any recommendations for decent security awareness training. This requirement is coming up more and more with regulators and underwriters.<p>In essence, this is of course more &#x27;box ticking&#x27; and has little to do with actual security, but the requirement remains.<p>Would love to hear from actual experience. I&#x27;ve gotten quotes from about a half dozen suppliers and I&#x27;ve yet to find a supplier that the staff wouldn&#x27;t hate me for subjecting them to. The materials are almost universally pretty childish and melodramatic.<p>Saw the Stacksi launch earlier last year and they seem to have the right idea for this domain. Would love to find a comparable company but offering security awareness training - or if the Stacksi guys are reading this, please consider adding this to your product line up! :)",
