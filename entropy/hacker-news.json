      "text": "Throwaway for all the obvious reasons.<p>I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s&#x2F;early 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;m bored out. I feel like I&#x27;ve done the rise and fall in tech. I&#x27;ve startupped, I&#x27;ve run (and sold, low 6 figs) my own company. I&#x27;ve helped others get started. I&#x27;ve mentored, I&#x27;ve been mentored. Honestly.. I&#x27;ve had a career.<p>In an attempt to get back into caring - I&#x27;ve taken a lower on the totem (senior foo) job. The reality is that.. I&#x27;m bored out. The problems needing solving seem repetitive, take their time, and just aren&#x27;t interesting. In fact, in 2021 we seem to be in the exact same area place as we were in 2001, just with different technologies - but the same problems.<p>How do others deal with this?  At this point I&#x27;m basically just trying to get the mental space in to deal with getting to retirement. I can hopefully retire with my full quality of life within 3-8 years... but how do you get there without frankly going nuts.  What can I do to improve my working situation?<p>Please, before people suggest therapy, religion, mindfulness, health, yoga, family connections, friends, charity, etc.. I have all that. I&#x27;m thankful (nay grateful) for everything we have.  I&#x27;m just...done, and I don&#x27;t know how to function anymore.<p>Help wanted - even if it&#x27;s just to hear from others with the same thoughts. Thank you so much for reading, and considering.",
