      "text": "Maybe it’s just me, but I’m fed up with the state of the web today. Unfortunately, the law passed by the EU makes most websites show a banner about their cookie policy, sometimes taking up half the real estate on mobile screen. Sometimes they let you change your “cookie preferences” but often times the “essential” cookies radio button is grayed out.<p>So now I have decided to close any non-essential website that does this crap. For example, there was an article on HN today that linked to fleksy.com which showed a huge cookie banner on my phone. Between learning about how swipe key works (the content on their website) and saving myself from having to tap on small buttons to close the banner, I chose the latter.<p>I think if more people did that, websites would be forced to avoid using cookies in such a way that necessitates a cookie prompt.",
