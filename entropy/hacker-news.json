      "text": "Electronically (i.e., legality aside), can a consumer VoIP interface (e.g., Ooma Telo) potentially listen in on an analog phone when the phone is on-the-hook, or is the phone&#x27;s mouthpiece&#x2F;microphone guaranteed to be inoperable by design for all phones, even the simplest all-analog models? Perhaps with enough gain, DSP, clever circuitry well beyond CMR, and so forth?<p>If so:<p>Do wiretapping laws prevent snooping on this single-party situation, and are they enforceable enough to be effective?<p>Presumably a PSTN CO could do the same, but I assume oversight is much tighter in that case, and I figure the chances of eliminating noise are immensely higher when there&#x27;s a Linux box (or whatever) right on the customer&#x27;s premises a few meters from the phone, rather than a long copper run to the pole and beyond.",
