      "text": "Hi there, I got a concussion last Friday in an accident. Got checked out by my doc and luckily only have a minor concussion. I’ve been trying to limit my screen time. In the first 48 hours i didn’t look at screens to much at all because it would bother me. Maybe an hour each day.<p>Now i feel myself reaching back for my phone and iPad as my head starts to clear up. I keep seeing online that gradual increase to activity seems the way to go. It’s been about 5 days now and my phone seems to be bothering me less.<p>Does anyone have experience in this regard? I’ve only had one other concussion but it was when i was young so i don’t really remember how long i stayed off screens.",
