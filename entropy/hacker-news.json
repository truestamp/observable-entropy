      "text": "Hi all,<p>I&#x27;m looking for a co-working space in London and would like some recommendations. I used to work in Shoreditch in 2010s but on a recent visit it seems the startup vibe is not what it once was (granted, there&#x27;s still pandemic going on).<p>Where are the entrepreneurs, startups and freelancers based today?<p>Backstory: I&#x27;m taking a month off work to build the company that I&#x27;ve always wanted to, maybe longer if it works out. I&#x27;ve always been passionate about interactive, immersive and 3D experiences and so this I will be looking for clients in this space. I&#x27;ve 10 years&#x27; experience as a software engineer and designer, having worked in video games and XR at big companies.<p>Thanks in advance!\nM",
