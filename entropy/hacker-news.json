And through these, a lot of our kiddos were able to jump through the entire K-8th grade math curricula in a single year.<p>Some of our favorites:\nMath Tango (K-3rd)\nBeast Academy (K-8th)\nProdigy Game (K-8th) Great for practice, some errors&#x2F;bugs\nDragon Box Algebra<p>Unfortunately, now that are kiddos are at the 9th grade level, the options seem sorely limited.<p>We can&#x27;t really find any great, adaptive math apps for higher level math , that really encourage critical thinking and problem solving.<p>I&#x27;ve scoured the secular homeschool groups on FB and reddit, looked through the app store, asked math teachers, but no luck so far.<p>One of our parents is even thinking of building his own...<p>Wondering if anyone here has tried anything they liked? Or possibly building something our kids could try?<p>Thank so much!",
