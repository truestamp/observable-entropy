      "text": "I put scammers in quotes because I’m not sure if it rises to the level of scamming but I feel like it does.<p>So apparently one can send someone a package with insufficient postage paid upfront, and the recipient is then forced to pay extra postage upon delivery or at the post office in order to receive it.<p>I’m not sure how long this “feature” has been available, but it’s most certainly a thing now— and I am not at all enthused about it.  It was only $3.xx in my case, but I indeed feel wronged.  I would have much rather just paid the extra $3 to not have to now wait until Monday and drive to the post office.<p>I won’t leave the eBayer’s name, but he has tons of 1-star reviewers with the same complaint.  Obviously there must be tons of eBayer’s using the same technique, so the USPS is, unwittingly or not, enabling this scamming practice.",
