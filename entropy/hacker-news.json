      "text": "Hi HN!<p>tl;dr - I wrote a 200 page user manual for team leaders and CEOs to navigate working from anywhere and open sourced it online for free: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;friday.app&#x2F;anywhere<p>I&#x27;m Luke, the founder of Friday.app. 8 years ago, I first read Remote by 37 Signals and it&#x27;s what caused me to start working remotely back in 2013. At the time, the book laid out a case that more organizations should offer remote work.<p>Over the years, I worked for a few different distributed companies in a variety of roles. I&#x27;ve seen what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Now, I run a software company building async tools for distributed teams. I&#x27;ve also spent years digging through research on distributed teams, asynchronous communication, and more. Basically, it&#x27;s been a huge area of focus for the past 8 years.<p>When the pandemic hit, people were CONSTANTLY asking me if I had any book recommendations. Unlike 2013, people didn&#x27;t need to be convinced about the benefits of working from anywhere, which Remote did a great job covering. Now, they were looking for a playbook on how to implement this stuff in a way that tapped into the benefits of distributed work - primarily the flexibility.<p>I never imagined writing a book, it&#x27;s not really my forte. But after seeing so many companies rollout terrible policies&#x2F;practices that made working from anywhere worse than going into the office, I decided to throw my hat into the ring.<p>The book teaches high-level principles and then dives into specific practices and playbooks, like:<p>- How to go async-first\n- What meeting should be an email? What email should be a meeting?\n- How to hire people you haven&#x27;t met\n- How to quickly onboard new teammates\n- How to feel connected &amp; stay accountable<p>These are all questions I hear all the time. This book is heavily focused on shifting towards an async-first environment, because I believe this is the #1 transition an organization needs to do.<p>Anyways, the entire thing is available for free online. There&#x27;s an audio version too. If you want a hardcopy, I&#x27;m offering that at cost on Amazon (I make 1 penny for every book sold).<p>Here&#x27;s direct links if you want to jump right in:<p>1.

Amazon: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Anywhere-Operating-System-business-anywhere&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1087874246&#x2F;<p>I hope this helps you all. I&#x27;m just tired of seeing people act like this is all brand-new, when in reality, there&#x27;s a mountain of evidence and best practices that can save you a lot of headaches.",
