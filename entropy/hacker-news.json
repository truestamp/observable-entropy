      "text": "After experiencing negative effects first hand, I&#x27;ve read a lot on the importance of air quality, which became quite more important with the increase of home office time in the past years. I&#x27;d like to get a reliable, preferably connected air quality sensor, at a price that makes it reasonable to place it in multiple spaces (like sleep, work).<p>I&#x27;m looking for a solution that has at least both humidity and particle matter (CO2&#x2F;PM2.5&#x2F;PM10) sensors.<p>There are DIY options as all required components seem to cost a few dollars, but I&#x27;m looking for ready-made products without soldering.\nWhile there really is quite a few of them, seemingly there is nothing between the $10-20 (Amazon desk stations, Ikea Vindriktning) and the $150+ range (PurpleAir, Kaiterra Laser Egg, Netatmo), former looking too cheap to be trusted, the latter possibly be too expensive to get multiple of (especially as reviews are not uniform of their accuracy).<p>Do you have any recommendations to monitor indoor air quality?",
