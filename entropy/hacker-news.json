      "text": "I lived in Thailand. The country has recently enacted Personal Data Protection Act 2019 (PDPA), but was delayed from becoming effective as the affected sectors are not ready. The law is essentially GDPR&#x2F;CCPA in my country, meaning that business requires consent to process personal information. I don&#x27;t usually object to the strictly necessary&#x2F;legitimate interest, but I don&#x27;t want my data to be used for targeted advertising, so I often decline the latter.<p>Today, I got an SMS that says &quot;Get Free 1GB of Internet for 24 hours by simply provide consent to process personal data under PDPA. More info at (website)&quot;. It came from mobile carrier that has 14 affiliated companies. I take a look at the website and it says:<p>&quot;... for the purpose of analyze and predict my preference or behavior, R&amp;D, product improvement and marketing planning in order to allow each company to present product&#x2F;service&#x2F;privilege&#x2F;promotions and offers ... that has been carefully optimized and selected for your preference&quot;<p>They said opt-out is possible, but they has not announced how. Other places that employ opt-out sometimes make it more difficult to opt-out (asked for opt-in in store, call to opt-out). 1GB of Internet for their indefinite period of using my data for advertising is simply not comparable, so I decline to provide consent. I don&#x27;t know how long will they ask me again. Has anyone been enticed to provide consent in similar manner? Would love to hear it!",
