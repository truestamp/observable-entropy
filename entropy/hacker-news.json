      "text": "The Intel SSE 4.2 instruction set added the new CRC32C computation instructions. They are super cool and they are SO MUCH faster than doing the CRC calculation in software.<p>But, as I was coding up crc32c for something, I noticed that the CRC32 instruction has a mode that returns a 64 bit value for 64 bit source operands, and a 64 bit value for an 8 bit source operand (in addition to 32 bit values for all the others).<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;dam&#x2F;www&#x2F;public&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;documents&#x2F;manuals&#x2F;64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf<p>See page 2A 3-225 and 226.<p>This means there is a strange<p>unsigned __int64 _mm_crc32_u64() in the Intel intrinsics (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;intrinsics-guide&#x2F;index.html#ig_expand=1494,1494&amp;techs=SSE4_2).<p>It isn&#x27;t a big deal, return a 64 bit value with the top two bytes set to zero, the result is correct. But, I&#x27;m sure there was some reason why Intel did this, has anyone found a good explanation for this somewhere - I&#x27;m asking only out of curiosity, not asserting that it is wrong or something.<p>I would have thought unsigned __int32 _mm_crc32_u64() would be more reasonable at least for the intrinsic, no?",

      "text": "My wife is a 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade in-class math tutor at a local elementary school in Massachusetts. She works with several students that do not speak English, or have a very limited English vocabulary. The school does not provide enough support to help the kids (or the teachers who only speak English), so my wife uses Google Translate on her phone to communicate with students one-on-one. It works, but it&#x27;s non-optimal and can&#x27;t be done easily by a teacher in front of an entire classroom.<p>What are some strategies and&#x2F;or other technologies that could be used by teachers in schools to help non-English speaking students while they learn English?",
