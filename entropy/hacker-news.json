      "text": "I am a self-taught programmer, and I am trying to get my first job related to coding. I&#x27;ve been programming in general for 6 years, most of the time in python with a few incursions into other languages. I also have the experience to be a Linux sysadmin, but I&#x27;d prefer something more dev-focused. I have a bunch of partially finished projects; most would take a bit to finish, but a few would be doable. I&#x27;ve setup a blog, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;holdnack.net, a week ago. So I guess I&#x27;m wondering is it better to have a few solid projects, one bigger project, a well-written blog or something else entirely? Oh, and this is focused on just getting an interview; I am generally confident on my interviewing skills, depending on how leet it is.",
