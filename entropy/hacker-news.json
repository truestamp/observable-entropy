      "text": "There&#x27;s this website that is in the form of a bunch of (fictional) alien and paranormal encounters. Each case is allocated a case number, and there&#x27;s a background story&#x2F;report for each encounter. It&#x27;s a semi-hauntological affair.<p>The site has been around for years but somehow its URL never stuck in my brain, and so it seems didn&#x27;t stick in Chrome&#x27;s bookmark brain either.<p>Somehow Google has wrecked my bookmarks in a sync&#x27;ing f-up, and Google&#x27;s search is so polluted with spam UFO encounter nonsense I can&#x27;t seem to narrow down my search.<p>Can anyone help me find this site again?",
