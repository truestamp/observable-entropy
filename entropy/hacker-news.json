Does anyone know how they managed it? Like, how did they keep the engineers interested? Were they paying out salaries at the time? If so, where did the money come from?",

Microsoft is also following suit.<p>This proves that now more than ever we need real alt tech. We need to standardize our open source solutions to these monopolies. They have too much control over our lives.<p>Whether this means a standardized Linux distro and app repository, a degoogled android phone that comes with software pre installed, and a push for crypto. Something has to be done, and it has to be done better than our current overly fragmented approach.",
