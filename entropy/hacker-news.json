      "text": "This occurred to me after reading two posts[1][2] I found here.<p>It&#x27;s interesting how the authors looked at games as ways of enhancing real-life skills (instead of purely entertainment).<p>For example, one post talks about using Poker to learn how to calculate odds and deal with imperfect information, which mimics real life better than a perfect information game like chess.<p>This sent me down the rabbit hole of looking for what types of benefits different games provide.<p>I found one cool paper[3] that shows first-person shooters enhance attentional capacity, distributed attention, and speed of attentional processing (even when compared to another game like Tetris).<p>So I wonder if you could only pick one game, what would it be and why? :P (this could be classical board games like chess or Monopoly, all the way to more modern games like Civ or a FPS)<p>[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31435034<p>[2]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31459044<p>[3]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature01647",
