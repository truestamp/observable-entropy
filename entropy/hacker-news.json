I find myself constantly going through three web views, making or accepting one appointment and creating a blocker in the other two.\nRunning on Linux, a big plus would be that the credentials won&#x27;t leave my system. I won&#x27;t mind using e.g. a private google account as &quot;master&quot; to merge and distribute the calendars as long as the others would only see &quot;blocker&quot; and not the details of the actual appointment.",
