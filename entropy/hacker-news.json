      "text": "Title says it all, how would you make a scalable web application in 2022 as a solo&#x2F;small team of devs? To limit the problem space, how about something that can handle CRUD operations for an internet T-shirt store getting 1000-100000 simultaneous visitors? I&#x27;m certainly open to learning clever ways to architect a mini-Youtube if that&#x27;s somehow possible though.<p>Perhaps to make advice easier, I&#x27;ve played around with things like Firebase and Meteor, did a kubernetes tutorial or two, deployed small toy apps on AWS&#x2F;GCP, as well as have some familiarity with ReactJS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS (I&#x27;m trying to get into gatsby but we&#x27;ll leave that aside), Docker, and the Django&#x2F;DRF framework. The issue is I don&#x27;t really know how to integrate them into a &quot;scalable&quot; or &quot;highly available&quot; web application, or even a methodology for comparing scalability for one approach vs another. I also understand CI&#x2F;CD pipelines are a part of the typical microservices architecture, but would they even make sense for a solo dev vs trying to get a monolith running? Given &quot;scalable&quot; can mean a lot of different things, I&#x27;m entirely fine with more open ended answers about focusing on things that will matter more than sheer connections handled and dynamic content served, so please don&#x27;t feel limited to answering in as few steps as possible if you think there are other insights about better practices&#x2F;design patterns that should be mentioned.<p>So for extra context: I&#x27;ll have a bit of free time in the next couple months to just sketch out ideas and try things (probably the last time for awhile), but I&#x27;m genuinely curious how the real software development practitioners would approach an open ended task like this. Unfortunately they weren&#x27;t exactly offering a class on how to make scalable web apps (probably because there&#x27;s thousands of different ways) during my pretty conventional college CS program, ya know?",
