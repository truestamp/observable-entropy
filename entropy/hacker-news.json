The app has a 3+ age-rating on the Play Store and uses crafty wording to hide the fact that it is real-money gambling going on in their games. They also use direct payments to bypass Google&#x27;s payment system and parental controls. What process can I go through to get Google to inspect this situation which I think is pretty serious?",
