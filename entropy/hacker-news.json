      "text": "I love coding. I have enjoyed it across a range of disciplines and projects since 1989. I have had some decent success and been financially rewarded for it. I get to love what I create. Increasingly, I am exposed to individuals who either aspire to the title (or have gotten the position) of Programmer, the coding part almost seems secondary. I find it difficult to connect and work with these individuals. It’s kind of like the passionate musician who gets paid trying to work and connect with contract musicians. I can’t change others; are there worldview adjustments I can adopt that will allow me to work with the 9-5ers more easily?",
