      "text": "Hello, I was recently asked to, if possible, implement Unicode in the password field. The storage is not itself a problem - the hasher itself can accept binary, so I could use UTF-8 so that I wouldn&#x27;t need to migrate ASCII passwords. My question is before that hasher: I&#x27;m aware that Unicode in itself is so messy that you need to normalise it first into <i>something</i> (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Unicode_equivalence) so that would not run on normalisation bugs (such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eclecticlight.co&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;08&#x2F;explainer-unicode-normalization-and-apfs&#x2F;). If it&#x27;s impossible, I would have to write a detailed reason since the application is used around the world and they would really prefer to support Unicode passwords.",
