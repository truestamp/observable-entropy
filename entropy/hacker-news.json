I have a child who is a broke college student, so I was thinking of paying them to do it over break.<p>What&#x27;s the most efficient way to do this from an INTAKE standpoint?  I need to get all the ISBNs into a database of some kind.<p>(The only other info I need is whether or not it&#x27;s a hardcover or software -- that&#x27;s something only the physical copy can tell me, everything else I should be able to get from the ISBN.)<p>I don&#x27;t want my daughter to have to find and key all the ISBNs in. Can they be scanned in some way? Is the ISBN in the UPC code?  Could I buy a cheap bar code scanner and just have her scan away?",
