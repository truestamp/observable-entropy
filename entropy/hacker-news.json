      "text": "Hi HN.<p>I&#x27;m in between jobs currently and am wanting to make some extra cash. I&#x27;m a full stack engineer with about 6 years of professional experience. Very confident in my craft, and just beginning to apply to jobs at mid-large companies.<p>Thing about mid-large companies is their hiring processes can be SLOW and I could use the cashflow sooner rather than later.<p>So I&#x27;m curious if anyone here has ideas on how to make quick cash within a week&#x2F;month. Would love to leverage my engineering skillset (web development-react,typescript,node,postgres) but am open to any and all ideas folks may have.<p>Currently residing in the US.",
