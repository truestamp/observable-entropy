I have some knowledge of Javascript but I don&#x27;t know React or Vue or any new JS library.<p>I see a lot the combination of Ruby on Rails with React so I decided I want to learn React and then maybe Vue.<p>So I am looking to buy a book or a course that could help me learn React (but not server side nodejs) as fast as possible.<p>I am looking at something where I can build a project with a medium difficulty. I tried in the past to learn Vue from some Udemy course and a book but I got bored with the pace of the resource. It was building something very simple and focused too much on Nodejs on Backend and React on Frontend.<p>What would you suggest? What worked for you?",
