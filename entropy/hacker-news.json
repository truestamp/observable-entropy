      "text": "Hi HN, thanks for reading this.<p>I&#x27;m in Italy now and really need to learn the language fast. I had a lot of success in Mexico learning Spanish, but I had a lot of help from an online course called &quot;Spanish with Paul&quot;.<p>This course in Spanish just put me on a very fast track to learning because of the order that it presented information, where you essentially start speaking right away, and you&#x27;re constantly being drilled with more and more complicated sentences, as you introduce new grammar.<p>This was a system that worked extremely well for me, but unfortunately I have not found anything similar for Italian - like a good blend being comprehensive AND practical. There are many courses that are kind of gimmicky, which is fine and I appreciate them, but I&#x27;m really looking for something that I can spend 2-3 hours a day in focused study&#x2F;practice that also lets me start building upon the daily practice I get from just living here.<p>I was planning on basically building my own version of the course I mentioned above, &quot;Spanish with Paul&quot;, by essentially just translating the same concepts over, however very early on I encountered concepts that don&#x27;t exist in Spanish at all, for very simply constructs. E.g.:<p>eng: I want \\ \nesp: quiero \\ \nita: voglio \\<p>(ok, simple)<p>eng: I want it \\\nesp: lo quiero \\ \nita: lo voglio \\<p>(So far so good, perfectly smooth sailing)<p>eng: I need \\ \nesp: necesito \\ \nita: ho bisogno \\<p>(Ok, this &#x27;ho&#x27; is acting like &#x27;haber&#x27; in Spanish... I know this, not the end of the world...)<p>eng: I need it \\ \nesp: lo necesito \\ \nita: ne ho bisogno \\<p>(wtf... then I look up &#x27;ne&#x27; and I am introduced at step 0. to the world of Italian pronouns and my face melts)<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just a temporary road block and in the future if I read a similar post to this I&#x27;ll have great advice, but for the time being I&#x27;m in that awkward phase where I really feel like I&#x27;m wasting time by not doing focused studying because I&#x27;m chasing various rabbit holes.<p>So, something a little more curated would be great, and maybe I could eventually make that &quot;course&quot; I was talking about. Any help, would be very appreciated. My secret weapon with learning Spanish was really just studying a lot and practicing, and not wasting time doing other stuff.<p>Thank you!",
