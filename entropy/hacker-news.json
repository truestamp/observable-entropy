      "text": "I am looking for a comprehensive resource on data visualization. There are many individual resources that have been posted over the years (such as in blog posts). However, as a non-expert I am not sure which advice is good to follow (e.g., many blogs are published by companies trying to sell me a particular product or package).<p>Not sure if the book is the ideal format for this, but it seems to have the highest chance of being competent, unbiased and comprehensive. For the latter point, I think important topics are<p>- Colors and accessibility<p>- Concrete examples of color schemes<p>- Pros and Cons of different visualizations vis-à-vis data<p>- Print versus digital<p>- Fonts and layout considerations<p>- Perhaps short insights into the research on these points<p>But perhaps there are other things not on my radar that are current or interesting?",
