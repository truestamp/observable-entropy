      "text": "I&#x27;m starting a web based project (actually my first) so I have no history or technical preferences yet I&#x27;d have to consider. The project can be imagined as some sort of collaborative scene graph editor, so I have to synchronize a tree-like data model among browsers and the server.\nRegarding choices for specific libraries I&#x27;ll be going to use, the data store and synchronization aspect seems to have the biggest impact on the general application architecture.\nWhat modern, well documented, flexible technology&#x2F;libraries would a well-informed web developer have to choose from today? I have no need for backwards compatibility, but I&#x27;d prefer as little dependencies as possible and if that&#x27;s an option today I&#x27;d also like to avoid transpilation.\nOne important aspect to me (although I&#x27;m not planning to implement it from beginning) is offline use.",
