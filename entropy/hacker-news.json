      "text": "Hi HN! When you have a production system running, every now and then there are requirements to made a DB update because of some bug in the code, or for some use cases which were not thought of earlier. How do you handle such updates?<p>The common way I know is the access is given to a small number of trusted people who make the updates. Are there any other ways or best practices such that the small set of people don&#x27;t end up becoming bottlenecks, apart from the potential risk of abuse of trust.",
