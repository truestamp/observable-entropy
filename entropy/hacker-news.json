      "text": "Recently I&#x27;ve gotten more and more curious about the idea of using music (listening to or making it) as a therapeutic tool, in the most general sense.<p>Now I don&#x27;t really mean the music we play nonstop in the background. I mean it in a more deliberate way, like a practice&#x2F;ritual done regularly because you really notice the positive effects it has in your life.<p>What genre and&#x2F;or artists work best for you? Do you listen to different things for particular purposes&#x2F;situations? Do you listen with headphones or on stereo? Do you do other things while listening, or do you focus your attention solely on the music? Any other patterns you&#x27;ve observed?<p>And if you make music, are there particular aspects that are more therapeutic than others?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ll be honest, I used to get so excited by web development when I was still a teenager. I would spend hours building websites in PHP, learning HTML, hacking vBulletin forums, copying and pasting code from tutorials online.<p>15 years later and I actually work as a web developer, and frankly, the work is becoming a bit stale. I&#x27;ve probably spent too long working on the same sorts of things: Laravel, WordPress plugins, CRUD stuff mostly. But really, I think part of the joy has disappeared because it&#x27;s become something I rely on for my income, rather than a passion.<p>I&#x27;d like to re-capture the joy I used to feel when I first started coding.<p>Web devs: what excites you about web development at the moment? I&#x27;d like to hear the frameworks, languages, projects or dreams you have that energise you.",
