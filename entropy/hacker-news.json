      "text": "What are the ideas in programming that once you saw you could never go back looking into other programs the same way.\nFor e.g, one a recent HN thread about units[0] one user shared a F# snippet like this<p><pre><code>    unit type Meters = m\n    unit type Seconds = s\n    val speed = 5.4 m&#x2F;s \n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m unfamiliar with F# but having units right next to value is something i&#x27;ll be remembering everyday from now on[1]<p>Some other ideas that changed the way i look at programs.<p>* Lisp Macros\n* First class functions.\nPassing functions as a value is something that i do everyday.\n* Garbage collection. Not having to worry \nabout memory allocation is such a relief.<p>The last 2 points are surprisingly a common pattern now,\nbut for someone coming from C[2] and shell scripting\nits a whole different world here.<p>======<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30749134\n[1]: In school we were made to write units next to values,\nNow that ive seen it, i ask myself why don&#x27;t more languages support this.\n[2]: i&#x27;m aware of function pointers in C but its something\nthat i rarely used(iirc qsort expected it).",
