      "text": "Many years ago, I heard a Tim Ferris podcast with Robert Rodriguez is an avid journaler and used a bunch of Word documents to organize his daily notes. Ever since then, I couldn&#x27;t get my mind off of a personal journaling system primarily organized by day; with a secondary topical organization by Label. After a few false starts of my own and wasting about $10K on an off-shore development company, I was still left with nothing. Recently, I decided to give it one more push and developed the first draft of my dream journaling tool.<p>I&#x27;m a developer, I want to also be a writer. Development comes much easier to me than writing.<p>This is an Angular app deployed into Firebase. This was my first time using Firebase. I never published an app in public before because I don&#x27;t feel like I know enough about security. Firebase took all of the thinking out of it (I hope).<p>Still ugly and have a ways to go, but wanted to share this to see what people think. (Note if document comes up blank, hit refresh :).",

      "text": "The road on which our house in rural France sits finally got a name two years ago.<p>But still no-one can find us because Google Maps hasn&#x27;t added it. UPS delivers parcels to an access point 10km away, and doesn&#x27;t tell us. Other couriers leave our parcels randomly at a similarly named street hundreds of yards away.<p>I&#x27;ve submitted the name through the Android app multiple times, including attaching a geotagged photo of the street sign, but no dice. My addition of the name for an adjacent street that was also missing was accepted within 24 hours, first attempt.<p>I&#x27;ve submitted the new name to OpenStreetMap successfully. Is there anything else I can do? And why are they incapable of correctly evaluating contributions that match up with the official cadastral map?",
