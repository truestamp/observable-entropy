There should be enough clues to figure it out if you want to spend the time looking through. I have no idea if I made this hard or easy, it could take someone 5 minutes or it could take 5 days.<p>If you are interested head over to this link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fymhotsauce.rocks&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;news&#x2F;solve-my-puzzle-and-win-250-in-bitcoin<p>TO THE MOON!!!<p>No purchases or anything required, just a fun giveaway that will require you to use your brain. If people really enjoy this I plan on doing more like it as I had a fun time planning it out.",
