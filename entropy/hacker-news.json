If not, I wonder what aspect of software prevents us from having those feelings?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been somewhat inspired by the latest discussion about internet addiction and its&#x27; effect on book reading.\nWhat are your ways of taking notes from books?<p>As for me, I&#x27;m mostly reader of historical books. On my desk I had recently <i>China. A History</i> by John Keay and <i>The Power Broker</i> by Robert Caro. I admit I had finished neither of both, mostly due to laziness. The book on China I ended reading in around 1&#x2F;3.\nI&#x27;ve got back to it yesterday and one thing hit me hard. I had forgotten almost everything besides some really obvious themes, and so I&#x27;m going from the beginning again.<p>Enough for preface, here comes my question. How do remember what you read, and connecting with that, how do you take notes and how do you organise them? \nFrom school I remember old good method - you take a notebook and copy most of the book. Still, while I believe that method has some merit - I take notes from the famous Tanenbaum book in this way, because I am expected to know that topic <i>really</i> well. But that takes a lot of time and I wouldn&#x27;t do that if it is not necessary. Another method I had some success with was writing a one-liner summary of a single paragraph in the book, but I&#x27;ve been raised to never write in books and I can&#x27;t shake that off.",
