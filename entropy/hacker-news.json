      "text": "I had an interview for a software test engineer at an ML company in Palo Alto that I flunked hard on Monday. First I had to complete a series of leetcode questions on CodeSignal which I just about passed and then had an algorithms interview where I totally forgot how to implement a binary search tree (specifically inserting values), and just got the rejection letter. I got one working, just, but it was a cumbersome process of working it out from foggy memory. To be fair I’d had a four hour on-site just before that, and also had to fly to England two hours after, so my head wasn’t in the right space.<p>Anyway, my question is when did leetcode become appropriate for test engineers? Are there any hiring managers here who can explain a double leetcode interview process? I really don’t want to spend my free time learning these things by rote to prepare!<p>I’m a little stung by the whole ordeal because it sucked failing so hard.",
