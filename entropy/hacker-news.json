Are they desperate to sign up as many startups as possible, are they looking for a couple of co-founders that look like they are a match made in IT, or have they just simply realized that, hey, if you meet someone online or at a coffee shop, your chances of success are not that bad, after all! Or if they meet on the YC online dating site, then they have to sit and think of a precursor project to work on first to show compatibility ...<p>I just don’t get it.",
