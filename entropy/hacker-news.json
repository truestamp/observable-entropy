      "text": "Apparently if I want to build something less than 120 square feet, I can do whatever I want, but if it&#x27;s bigger I need to do some structural engineering to show my structure can handle wind shear, uplift, seismic activity, etc—even it&#x27;s just a 200 square foot chicken coop!<p>Since it&#x27;s a bit silly to pay someone to do that for a humble chicken coop, and since learning how to do it sounds fun: have any of you developed plans for your own small structure and gotten them approved by your city?
