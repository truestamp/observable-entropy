Ideally, I would ask people to press a different number depending on the call&#x27;s nature (think commercial offer vs job-related call vs friends&#x2F;family vs emergency), and I&#x27;d love to even have a &quot;secret&quot; code for special people that would make the phone actually ring even while I&#x27;m asleep.<p>Android being open-source, I guess the Telephone app source should be available, so maybe someone already built some programmable capabilities on top of it?",
