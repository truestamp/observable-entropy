      "text": "I have a main router and since my back patio and garage don&#x27;t get the WiFi coverage, I have installed a range extender. Whenever I visit the garage my iPhone 12 Pro Max doesn&#x27;t seem to switch to the range extender, I have to manually open WiFi settings and click on it for it to connect. Now I go back to my living room and sit right next to my main router, my phone is still talking to the range extender even throws poor connection&#x2F;no internet (!) and I have to walk again through the settings and select my main router. Is it that hard to automatically switch between saved Access Points based on relative signal strengths?",
