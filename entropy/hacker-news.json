But I keep thinking, what if we could actually get a small propulsion device into Earth orbit? All it would need is a solar panel and a fart, and we could set it on a trajectory to collide with the moon. Even if it&#x27;d take 10 years to get there, it&#x27;d still be really cool.<p>There are services that launch small satellites into orbit for a fee (usually something like $30k-$60k per 1kg payload).<p>Why isn&#x27;t this feasible?",
