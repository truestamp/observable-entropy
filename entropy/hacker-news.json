      "text": "I am in my late 30s, currently a mid-level PM that has spent the better part of a decade at series A and B startups. I have previous experience in analytics and occasional dabbling of amateurish coding on the side.<p>I have always wondered if I&#x27;d be happier and less stressed as a developer. I&#x27;ve historically had difficulty with work life balance in a PM role; much of this problem is me, but some is the PM life as well. Every couple of years I wonder about going to code camp.<p>I am not worried about having to start at the bottom again and earning a entry level salary but am worried about ageism. Worst scenario would be I end up in a situation where I can&#x27;t get a dev job and I&#x27;ve created too much of a gap to return to a good PM role.<p>With an earlier analytics background perhaps data engineering would be a softer&#x2F;safer path, but I also like the idea of full stack or mobile.<p>Success to me might look like being as capable as a decent-performing mid-level dev at a pre-IPO scale-up within 5 years of taking the leap. I am going to be real with myself that FAANG would be a stretch.<p>Have any ex-PMs here made a later career switch like this? Any ENG hiring managers have advice? Am I crazy?",
