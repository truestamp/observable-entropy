      "text": "Today I was considering how organizations such as bitly, imgur, reddit, and even github handle hash collision prevention.<p>While for GH it (seems) easier as commit hashes are sufficiently long&#x2F;unique, for others with character hashes that only span ~6 chars or so, there&#x27;s bound to be instances where hashes conflict from a statistical standpoint.<p>To my mind these orgs have to have a suite tools&#x2F;algos requesting information from multiple services, checking whether or not a hash has been taken – and those processes have to optimize for time. (e.g. when a user makes a post, what&#x27;s a reasonable time to do a lookup?)<p>So, what are the considerations which need to be made algorithmically to check such collisions while keeping runtime to an acceptable minimum?",
