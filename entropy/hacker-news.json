      "text": "Hi Hacker News,<p>I&#x27;m looking to connect with coders in recovery.<p>I have six months of sobriety after many years of more or less functional alcoholism. I&#x27;m regularly attending AA meetings but I recently parted ways with a sponsor as I struggled to balance the social and service comittments involved in working the steps with quite an intense technical workload at an early stage software business. I&#x27;m not naturally very social and I find it hard to find the energy to connect with people in the program after a hard day of code and video calls.<p>It&#x27;d be great to hear from people who have been through a similar situation. I&#x27;d also welcome books, resources, links, perspectives and anything else people have found helpful.",
