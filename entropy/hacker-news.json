      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m having an dilemma about my career. I&#x27;m very fortunate to be in the position I&#x27;m in, I have a very secure and well paying job. I write APIs&#x2F;web services&#x2F;websites for a big company. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d call particularly challenging, it&#x27;s fairly CRUDdy but there has been some interesting challenges here and there. I&#x27;ve manged to work my way into a more senior position in the company expecting the challenges to be greater, but it&#x27;s pretty much more of the same. And to be honest, I&#x27;m feeling burnt out and bored to death.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it just means I should move companies and it&#x27;s not the high level dev that&#x27;s burnt me out. Or whether it is that I want a different&#x2F;harder challenge.<p>If you&#x27;ve felt this as a developer:<p>Have you moved internally to another team and felt reinvigorated?<p>Did moving companies reinvigorate you even if the work is mostly the same (e.g. writing micro services)?<p>Has anyone moved to lower level programming to face a different challenge (e.g. embedded, game engines, etc.)? How did you do it?<p>Has anyone worked in a company that employs both high level and low level developers (e.g. game developer with online services and a game engine, company with web services and robot firmware, etc.) and successfully moved internally to lower level development?",
