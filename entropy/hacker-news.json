      "text": "I just read an article that suggested I should wash all plastic before I put it the recycle bin. Otherwise, I risk having the whole bin being throw in to a landfill since it&#x27;s contaminated.<p>WTF, what&#x27;s the point of plastic, If I have to wash it before I put it in the recycle bin? If I have to do that then I might as well have containers that I can  wash and return to  the store. Are plastic producers so greedy that making a buck supersedes the environment?<p>At this point, If I want to eat then I have to purchase food that&#x27;s packaged in plastic. I don&#x27;t think I have a choice.<p>I know I&#x27;m not likely to wash plastics before I put it in the recycle bin. I bet VERY few people ever do or will do.<p>So, is any plastic being recycled? What&#x27;s an alternative?",
