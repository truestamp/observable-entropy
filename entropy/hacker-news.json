      "text": "It&#x27;s likely that my wife and I will be moving to a rural and poor area in the US while continuing to work at my high paying FAANG job. The objective is to be closer to family (but not so close that I&#x27;m sorry I moved home-ish) and to try to put ourselves in a different environment with more activities outdoors and less downtime spent in front of screens.<p>I&#x27;m concerned about the possibility that I&#x27;m going to become an unhappy hermit, since the area doesn&#x27;t have much going on. Not many attractions, restaurants, etc. Very unlikely to find others with similar interests in computers and technology. Prevailing political views are also very different from ours. Also generally concerned about idea of living in a place where the median household income is literally 10% of what I make.<p>Some of the discussion in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29959746 touched on some of these issues and particularly the post from   \nsentientforest (not sure if there&#x27;s a way on HN to @-them) that contains this bit was very insightful.<p>&gt; Importing your tech worker salary to a region with few employers and less opportunity can make an impact. Tip your servers generously. Shop at local businesses. Hire local contractors and professionals. You might make a big difference. Keep in mind that your tech salary alone could easily be a few times the median household income of the region.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to get more of that kind of advice from people who have done this sort of thing.",
