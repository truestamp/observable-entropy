      "text": "I&#x27;m the founder of an early stage startup, located in a city where there are many job opportunities for software developers. As a developer myself, I know that it is very common for developers to switch companies every few years, in order to land significant pay increases. I know many people like to stigmatize this behavior, but I would never blame someone for wanting to grow their compensation. I&#x27;m also aware that if someone were to leave, we would incur significant costs in replacing them, ramping up their replacement, and re-learning the institutional knowledge that is lost.<p>For this reason, I would like to have a company policy that tells everyone explicitly that if they inform us of a job offer, we will never hold it against them, and we will never treat them negatively in future. And if the person is a valuable asset to the team, and genuinely interested in staying with us, we will match their job offer and do what we can to retain them.<p>I&#x27;ve had advisors tell me that saying this out loud is a bad idea, because it will encourage everyone to shop for offers. I can see their point, but I think it&#x27;s worth the downside if it can help us better retain our most talented employees. I&#x27;m also aware that people leave for many different reasons, and it won&#x27;t solve the attrition problem single-handedly (we&#x27;re early enough that no one has left us so far). But I figured this policy would be a win even if it only addresses some of the reasons for attrition.<p>Has anyone had experiences with companies where counter-offers were well-known or normalized? If so, how would you describe the impact it had on company culture and retention?",
