I would think that junk mail filtering systems would have a rule that mail is never junk if it is from someone who I just sent a message to, and especially if the subject line is similar to that of my recent message.<p>Why does this ever happen? In case it matters, my mail is hosted by gmail, and I access it via Mail on my Mac. I don&#x27;t know whether gmail or Mac Mail is marking this stuff as spam, but both companies should know better!",

Is there any programming language, hardware revolutions, or companies that you think could work as a central element of literary fiction? These technologies run our lives, but I find them stunningly difficult to depict. I have to wonder if I am simply looking in the wrong place. I wonder how Tolstoy would write about today’s world and the forces that drive it.",
