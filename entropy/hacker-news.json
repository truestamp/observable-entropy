      "text": "Currently researching the question with very limited industry experience myself and wonder: does everything ok here?<p>Complete and clear documentation of large legacy codebase is how common exactly in your experience?<p>Did API-documentation tools in the era of microservices aka Swagger&#x2F;Postman&#x2F;etc. eliminated the question completely?<p>My priors: \n- Clear documentation on high-level decisions and architecture is a good guide\n- Well docs on particular piece of code &#x2F; service saves ton of time for other person to work with - to update or debug.\n- It&#x27;s actually more probable in your company&#x2F;team that code won&#x27;t be documented on level considered &quot;good&quot;\n- The trickiest truth: it&#x27;s rather boring to create  and maintain documentation yourself and rarely rewarded career-wise, even inside one team.<p>So: \nlots of newbees to the industry (see-me) won&#x27;t have a knowledge of those processes from college; likely won&#x27;t see them implemented in their team&#x2F;org; likely won&#x27;t see any career benefits from implementing the process as it won&#x27;t seem great at perf review. Cycle ends here.<p>What am I missing in the view here?",
