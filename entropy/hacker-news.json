When I was involved in a data center buildout a few years ago, even things like facility perimeter fencing had minimum standards to meet!<p>I’m in the market for a new back door and lock, and noticed there isn’t really a good reference for how to assess and control risks. The police basically tell you to get a deadbolt and motion lights. Many people are into cameras everywhere.<p>Is there anything out there to help place somebody on an approximate risk spectrum and suggest things that one should take when retrofitting or building their home?",
