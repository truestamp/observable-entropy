      "text": "My goal was to create a DNS server as simple as the LDAP server I&#x27;ve been contributing to (glauth) and here it is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fusion&#x2F;kittendns<p>A few things to know about it:\n- It is easy to configure using a Toml file\n- I am using it to bail my coredns&#x2F;etcd instances when under attack\n- (yes, it also works as a service location server)\n- It comes with a simple, plain English, rule engine that doesn&#x27;t do much at this point\n- It can be used with LetsEncrypt. I use it to retrieve certificates for my home servers.\n- RFC: all the nice ones :)<p>Anyway, feedback is welcome.",
