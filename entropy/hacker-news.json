But then I get frustrated when she brings up these topics when I&#x27;m heads-down on work. We&#x27;re falling apart here!<p>A specific thing I&#x27;ve failed to figure out is how to control notifications regarding calendar invites - emails just find ways to be missed. I know I can pipe emails into something like Slack, but I&#x27;m wary of trying to sell my wife on a jury-rigged system.<p>Please, tell me what works for you.",
