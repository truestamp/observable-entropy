      "text": "We are moving off our legacy monolithic architecture to a microservice based architecture. We are about four years into the project and we have 200 distinct microservices.<p>When we first started out on this endeavor we created a parent POM called common-service. This POM declares dependencies such as Hibernate, Spring Boot, and some homegrown common libraries (the most important being a JAR that handles service discovery, rather than each service having to implement service discovery on their own).<p>Now that we have 200 services running in production, it is a difficult to roll out new versions of common-service for a variety of reasons - some teams don&#x27;t have the capacity, some teams prioritize business requirements over upgrades, etc.<p>How do you handle this in your organization? Do you have shared code across your microservices? Is it an anti-pattern to share code across microservices?<p>PS: We are going to start implementing Kubernetes. Kubernetes will require many changes to our common-service codebase so I figured I would see if anyone had any good ideas out there.<p>Thank you.",
