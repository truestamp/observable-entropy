      "text": "I have been thinking about this vague memory lately. Somewhere between 2011 and 2013, I used to go on an application on Facebook called &quot;Video Chat Rounds&quot; (article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adweek.com&#x2F;performance-marketing&#x2F;video-chat-rounds-random). It was an app on which you could video chat with other Facebook users (basically the same thing as Omegle). It used to be an app on the Facebook platform.<p>Back in the day I was still a kid and thought it was pretty cool to see and talk to people all over the world. There is one thing that is bothering me. I have this memory that sometimes, after I had just been on the app and went back to my Facebook homepage, I was suddenly logged into a random Facebook account from a person I had never heard of before. As a kid, that felt really illegal and scared me.<p>Now, many years later, I am wondering whether this memory is something which really happened or which I made up. It seems very unlikely you could get logged in as another user (without entering any credentials) on a platform like Facebook. However, I do believe it is a real memory.<p>My question is the following one: could this memory be real and if so, what did Facebook do wrong?",
