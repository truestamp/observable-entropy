It seems tough to get one [1] and slightly easier if one did a master program there.<p>Does anyone know of a cheap university offering 1 year (online) master programs that guarantees being selected for the extra 20K H-1B visa lottery?<p>I&#x27;d probably be interested in AI or data science (since I already did CS and Game-design as master degrees in Europe).<p>[1] I applied over 100 US companies, only one responded back and gave me an onsite (pre-covid so I flew to SF). Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t selected due to lack of experience back then.",
