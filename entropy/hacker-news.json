I&#x27;d prefer a single batteried framework supporting all of these out of the box.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since I can develop from a clean slate and I was hoping web dev in 2021 would be much simpler than what I am used to. However, I spent this entire morning looking at modern frameworks (not going to name them to avoid turning this into a different kind of discussion) and I&#x27;m kinda disappointed. They all look complicated and require lots of configs and plumbing to get started.<p>Any stack&#x2F;framework that you find simple and joyful to develop with?",
