      "text": "I&#x27;ve been contemplating the idea of moving over my accounts on various services to an email on my own domain (mail@pietro72ohboy.com instead of mail@gmail.com). Since this email will serve as a gateway to accessing (and recovering access if needed) for all services, I&#x27;d want it to be reasonably secure. I&#x27;ve tried to stick with services that allow an extra 2FA over the traditional username&#x2F;password login and I&#x27;m currently using fastmail for this.<p>I&#x27;d like to go back to using a service like Migadu that offer a simple, standard mail account accessible through IMAP and SMTP. Would an account secured by a sufficiently powerful password be secure enough? Or is 2FA a must for such accounts.",
