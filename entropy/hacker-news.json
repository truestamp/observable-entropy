      "text": "Hi there!<p>My girlfriend is entering her final year of her PhD program which is specifically doing lab research around Cardiovascular Sciences. She isn&#x27;t very sure what to do next, but having a look at one of the possibilities - being lab technician seems like a waste of time when you look at the time invested in studies vs salary expectations.<p>At the same time many people are seeing the Genomics industry being the next hottest industry after tech.<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer myself and I would like to help my partner develop even further.<p>From your experience what are some good career prospects that can take PhD &amp; Masters degree in Cardiovascular Sciences &amp; Genetics and potentially couple them with programming? What kind of companies are looking for such skilled people so we can read their job specs?<p>And from programming side, what kind of skills are usually required in such a career? Should we start by looking at Python courses and where do we move to after? Machine learning?<p>I know the question is a bit open ended, to some degree that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m lacking knowledge in her field! Many thanks!",
