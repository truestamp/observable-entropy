      "text": "So have been going through my e-mail archive and there are a bunch of what I&#x27;d call &quot;interesting&quot; e-mails from google about changes in policy<p>on 28 Apr 2011 22:23:41 -0400 (no actual date header in email it seems, so going by received header, does have what appears to be a valid DKIM header)<p>Hello,<p>We recently announced upcoming changes to the maximum number of users for Google Apps. We want to let you know that, as a current customer, the changes will not affect you.<p>As of May 10, any organization that signs up for a new account will be required to use the paid Google Apps for Business product in order to create more than 10 users. We honor our commitment to all existing customers and will allow you to add more than 10 users to your account for yucs.org at no additional charge, based on the limit in place when you joined us.<p>Sincerely,<p>The Google Apps Team<p>on Sat, 08 Dec 2012 02:18:41 +0000 they sent<p>Here&#x27;s some important news about Google Apps--but don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s no  \nneed for you to take any action.

To  \nreflect this change, we&#x27;ve renamed our products.<p>To be clear, only our name is changing. The product experience remains the  \nsame, as does our commitment to bringing you the best tools to run your  \nbusiness.",
