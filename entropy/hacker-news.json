      "text": "Recently there were some discussions regarding the fact that Google is no longer producing high quality results.<p>I’m not sure wether this has been already implemented by any search engine but I thought it for a while: can search results be improved by also checking&#x2F;ranking the time spent by the user on the relative page? Maybe by playing a bit with URLs and redirects?<p>For instance, if a lot of people are visiting a page and are not leaving it (not going back to the search results), then most probably it means that the page is pretty valid (high rank). If a lot of people are visiting a page and are leaving it after few seconds, then most probably it means that the page is not valid (low rank).",
