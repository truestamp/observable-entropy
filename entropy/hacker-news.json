      "text": "I feel it weird that this company is often posting jobs for “love coaches” who are quite unlikely to read HN very much.<p>Plus when you click on the link, you get a mission statement and description of the service before the job description, which is not totally unusual, but still makes it possible to bait potential clients rather than applicant prospects.<p>The glaring inappropriateness of those posts is also a testament to how good the moderation is on HN. Very few posts on the front page feel like ads at all, except for those ones…<p>IMO, these definitely fall in the growth hack dirty tricks bin…",
