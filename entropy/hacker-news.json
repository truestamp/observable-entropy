Most of my time goes into identifying and fixing bugs, I also get to work on new user stories but since I am new on the product I am mostly assigned bugs and doing testing so I can get familiar with the product. The good part is I got to learn core concepts of JavaScript like OOP in JS, how prototypes work in JS etc.<p>React and other frontend frameworks are all the rage nowadays and I am afraid if I keep working with the old stack and don&#x27;t update my technical knowledge in line with new industry trends then it&#x27;s going to hurt my career in the future.<p>I am confused about what to do, should I start looking for a job where react or some other framework is being used on the frontend or keep on the current job for now?",
