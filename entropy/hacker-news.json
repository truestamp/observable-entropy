      "text": "Premise: this is a sensitive topic, but of strong intellectual and practical interest, and I see this community as one of the best to fruitfully tackle the matter.<p>I would be grateful for help in assessing the risks, in amount (probability, conditions&#x2F;demographics) and details (what may happen, for how long), of the vaccines (foremostly of the vaccines, then of COVID-19) against the current in-focus epidemic. Any &quot;Cost&#x2F;Risk&#x2F;Benefit&quot; analysis is supposed to be based on numbers - these numbers may not be immediately available.<p>The consequences of interest are those of mid-long duration - what lasts only a few days is assumed as &quot;endurable&quot;. What may instead last for many weeks, months etc. is relevant.<p>I have for now only directly checked the data from the USA VAERS system: it seems fairly reliable in terms of the data contained (it is reported to be mostly compiled by medical practitioners), but is very probably less reliable in terms of real amounts - reporting is voluntary. It would be useful to compare it to systems with &quot;active monitoring&quot; in which the compilation from practitioners is mandated. For the moment, I could only access the data from VAERS and could not enter other sources (e.g. the European and the Australian one). Already in the VAERS it does not seem immediate to discriminate the expected first-days side effects from the long duration ones.<p>I also do not know which repository about the consequences (condition, probability, duration, demographics...) of actual infection could be the most reliable. In fact, even calculating the odds of infection does not seem trivial.<p>Thank you.",
