      "text": "Hi guys,<p>I&#x27;ve been a big fan and proud premium user of RTM for more than ten years now. I love how it sticks to the KISS principle and how developpers haven&#x27;t feel the need to add cunbersome features over the years. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s really efficient and the app had been a big part of my pro and personal life for years.<p>While i&#x27;m very happy to contribute to it by paying my yearly subscription, I&#x27;m still a bit worried about it being sold and&#x2F;or shutdown and would love to be ready for a more sustainable tool when this eventually happens (Fingers crossed, the later the better).<p>I love how Joplin helped me to deal with my notes, how Keepass helped with my passwords, or Veracrypt with my encrypted drives and I would feel safer to have a similar solution for my tasks.<p>Do you guys know any open source desktop or self-hosted app that show similar way to add and handle task ?<p>Thanks for your help.<p>Best,<p>L.",
