      "text": "Some venues accept a photo of a negative DIY corona test result as an alternative to asking to self-test at the front door in the presence of someone of the venue and waiting for ~15 minutes?<p>I wonder how to prevent abuse and how to make sure the test was actually recent instead. One option is to ask for a newspaper date with both the pre-test picture and the post-test picture. \nIs there a better method without making it a server side webcam or phonecam snap and timestamp service? The latter can also be be tampered with by feeding older&#x2F;other pictures to he webcam.",
