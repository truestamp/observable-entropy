      "text": "Hello,<p>This year I took a trip to Europe and really loved it. I got such a thrill from visiting new cities and learning about their culture. I only spent maybe 3 days per city, but I would love to spend more like a few weeks per city&#x2F;area. I&#x27;m wondering with the rise of remote work, is it possible to do this for the medium-term (I&#x27;m talking 1 to 1.5 year(s)). Has anyone lived a nomadic lifestyle like this? How did it pan out? What type of work did you do to support yourself?<p>Cheers!",
