      "text": "Might be simple, just trying to think of sane ways to do it. These are plain web sockets in Web JS to Node not using something like socket.io. It&#x27;s user A to server to user B and vice versa.<p>There would be some kind of db involved in the event of it going down&#x2F;can reconnect people by some ids.<p>My concern is do you keep say multiple domain options on the app (by env variables) or do you have a single url you hit (no?) and that branches off to different instances.<p>Scale is small now as in 10&#x2F;100s of users, performance is not like a video game but still real time&#x2F;more than text chat. The data rate is still low, mostly transferring meta data.",
