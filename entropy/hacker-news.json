I am guessing it wouldn&#x27;t be safe for me to self hosting, given the nature of these files.<p>If someone can give me a pointer, that will be great.<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "I am trying to understand how to better negotiate equity grants after reading some articles that explore changes to compensation practices, so I wanted to ask the community about their experiences:<p>- Company stage? Seed, Series A, B, ..., D, etc.\n- How was it explained to you? Terms, requirements for grant, communicated verbally or written, etc.\n- If you have experience as founder, executive, or equivalent role in trying to convince the board to approve an equity refresher program, how did it go? Board member awareness of the concept, concerns, etc.<p>Some of the readings that spurred this question, and for context purposes:<p>[1, PDF] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.gusto.com&#x2F;rs&#x2F;110-WOX-868&#x2F;images&#x2F;An%20Entrepreneur%E2%80%99s%20Guide%20to%20Employee%20Equity.pdf\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.samaltman.com&#x2F;employee-equity",
