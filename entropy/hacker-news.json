      "text": "There are two clips making the round on social media of Putin in a circle with other people.<p>It is important to know the truth. This has implication on his reported germaphobic and absence in public.<p>I see 3 options:<p>- It is fake, he wasn&#x27;t in the room with others.<p>- It is real, he isn&#x27;t nearly as germaphobic as the press made him out to be.<p>- He dressed up his personal staff that has always been inside his bubble.<p>As i write this, social media has people tripping over each other to discuss option 1. There are currently 2 clips commonly shared.<p>A low quality Russian clip, showing his hand phase through a microphone \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;alexkhrebet&#x2F;status&#x2F;1500170161726369799<p>A high quality clip used in foreign media. The independent appears to be using the longest cut. \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BdqH2IeAYSU<p>Social media is busy arguing if this could be a compression artifacts or not. Others are saying its all composition shots. i.e. neither is addressing the others argument. Many subreddits have chosen to ban discussions entirely.<p>I&#x27;d like to know the truth, and Reddit or Twitter isn&#x27;t the place to find out at the moment. Is anybody able to answer these two questions and elaborate on their process?<p>- Is the low resolution clip possible through compression artifacts?<p>- Is Putin really in the room with these people?<p>Cunningham tells me it is fake, the microphone in the high quality version doesn&#x27;t react enough to the hand motion around it. Between 0:22 and 0:25 ( on highest quality ) the digital video should have the edges reacting. instead it looks like the microphone is painted on.",
