      "text": "I recently had two experiences with Apple customer service and they both had the same unpleasant vibe. A way to put it: I had the impression that I was dealing with an entitled snob.<p>The first experience, I had an issue with my Airpods Pro (common issue apparently). I was unlucky and it was the second time it happened to me : they gave me replacements 2 months ago, and the replacements started malfunctioning again. During my latest visit, the Genius-staff went out of their way to make sure I understood they were making me a favor replacing them again. They were expressing this in different ways such as coming back to me several times saying &quot;the system shows that your airpods have already been replaced, I&#x27;m not sure I can replace them, however normally it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue because it&#x27;s a common problem&quot;, or &quot;here, it&#x27;ll cost 179$, but I&#x27;ll go check with my manager to see if I can waive the fee&quot;... The whole thing took 2 hours.<p>The second one was when the screen of my macbook air started showing dead pixels. I went to a store to have it replaced. The first thing the staff did was to examine the laptop and tell me that &quot;there are some marks on the cover, like if I had dropped something on it (seriously?!), but they don&#x27;t seem to be related to my issue&quot;. Again, they print the bill (400$+) and &quot;waive&quot; the fee.<p>Both experience gave me a very negative feeling of a company trying to find every way to shift the responsibility to me, and making sure that I understood (by showing the bill) that they were making me a favor (honoring a warranty is in no way a favor, if anything it&#x27;s an inconvenience for the customer). I never had to use any warranty in my life (the way it should be), except for these two occurences with Apple... I am appalled by the misalignment between the premium experience of the products and the miserable experience of the after sales service.",
