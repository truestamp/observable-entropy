I&#x27;m a (somewhat) competent software engineer, yet I find myself becoming increasingly frustrated by what I perceive to be an unnecessary amount of friction most tools require in order for me to actually make something. I feel as if there&#x27;s some magical tool, language, framework, or technology that exists which could immensely improve my developer experience if I just found it and used it. While I doubt the magic tool actually exists, I am interested in hearing how other developers minimize this friction.",

I just find browsers fascinating and would like to learn more about them.<p>I want to have an actual Window appear that can emit text, color, and shapes. I don&#x27;t want to use a graphic UI framework like WPF. I also believe a graphics library like DirectX or OpenGL would be overkill as it&#x27;s adding features I don&#x27;t need, but I really don&#x27;t know. Chrome and Firefox use ANGLE, maybe that&#x27;s a start?<p>TLDR If I wanted to write a layout engine for multiple OS&#x27;s, should this be built on top of a graphics library, a windowing system, both, or something entirely different?",
