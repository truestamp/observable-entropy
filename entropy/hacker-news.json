      "text": "Over here[0] was some tin-hat speculation that FB might use the outage as a distraction while they wiped data from their systems to cover evidence of their many, many infelicities.  Immediately readers assumed that it&#x27;s being suggested that the outage was being created to do this.<p>That was never suggested.  It was <i>not</i> suggested that the outage was <i>instigated</i> for the purpose of creating the cover, merely that it could be, might be, <i>used</i> as a cover.<p>I&#x27;d hope people would have a rational discussion about the question and the issues, the possibilities and the probabilities, but the submission has been flagged.  Fair enough.  What drives me to distraction is people not reading what&#x27;s actually said, and instead reacting to something that wasn&#x27;t said.  I honestly expected better of the HN community.<p>I guess I was wrong.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28752413",
