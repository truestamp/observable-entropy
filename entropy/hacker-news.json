      "text": "I used to work on social apps (such as dating apps) and I&#x27;m hoping to get some insight into whether it is worth spending time building something in this space.<p>One of the things that left a pretty sore spot for me working on dating apps was that the intention of the apps (implicit) was to keep the user paying. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but I always felt bad when I really thought about it - love is just marketing, keep feeding the hedonistic treadmill and pay.<p>Having worked on a variety of different products from e-commerce to distribution to saas, I realized I like working on products that people regularly use, especially products that people find value in whether it saves them time or opens up new avenues for them to explore.<p>So, I&#x27;d like to build something that people will keep coming back to because they find value in it, not because there&#x27;s fear of rejection or &quot;getting matches&quot;. Sorry for the ramble, been a long day and I&#x27;m just hoping to have a discussion.<p>What do you think is missing in the current slew of social apps? What would you like to see, or what are your thoughts on these current social apps?",
