      "text": "Hi! I just bought an Oculus Quest 2 to try out VR. I figured that enough games looked fun (e.g. Eleven Table Tennis) and it might offer a productivity boost (via an app like Immersed).<p>I noticed that the Oculus Quest 2 almost seems to be there, but the DPI seems to be a bit lower than I&#x27;d like. I do think I&#x27;d be able to get used to it, so it&#x27;s not too much of a problem. With that said, I do think there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement there.<p>So my question to you is: according to you which VR headset is the best for productivity?<p>I don&#x27;t have the money for it, but I figure that one could really pack a punch with the Varjo XR 3 (multiple screens in AR). The pricing isn&#x27;t really consumer friendly though.",
