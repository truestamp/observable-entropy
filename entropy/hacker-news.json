      "text": "My wife is Indonesian, and for her generation, it is common to have been given name only. There is not family name. Her Indo passport has her one name. The US Federal government put &quot;HerName FNU&quot; (not even in the righ order), which stands for &quot;First Name Unknown&quot;. NYS has put &quot;HerName LNU&quot; with &quot;LNU&quot; meaning &quot;Last Name Unknown&quot;, and other companies have put her name twice for first and last names; my last name (even though our wedding certificate has only her one name); and variations on the above &quot;LNU&quot; and &quot;FNU&quot; combinations. We tried to get her learner&#x27;s permit today at the NYS DMV, and they wouldn&#x27;t accept all the documents we presented, because of the differences in the names. What can we do? How can digital input forms be made more global or unbiased for such cases? Thanks!",
