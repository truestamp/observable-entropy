The author had been working on this project for more than 5 years and he had been pushing code almost every single day.<p>Unfortunately, he had to stop development since Russia invasion of Ukraine, as he lives in Kyiv, Ukraine. He said he was OK and would like to continue development &quot;after Ukraine’s victory&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trunkmaster&#x2F;nextspace&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;412). But that was about 4 months ago.<p>As someone who really likes NeXTSTEP and hopes NEXTSPACE to succeed, the current situation is sad.<p>Just wanted to inform the crowds at HN about this.<p>:wq",
