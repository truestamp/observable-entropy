      "text": "So, I&#x27;m working on a new idea to build a &quot;friendly neighborhood&quot; of the world wide web where websites respect the privacy of visitors and do not track them. Technologically I already know how to approach this, but I&#x27;m wondering about the funding model.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about building a community where people donate money and we distribute that among the website publishers, following a model similar to Humble-Bundle where supporters can decide how much money should go to the publishers and how much should go to us (so that we can fund our work).<p>Would you support something like that? I think even with a small community we could quickly help some folks that run great niche websites to switch to a more privacy-friendly funding model.",
