      "text": "Lately I&#x27;ve come across quite a few online storefronts that appear to be fake. Mostly showing up in Google Shopping results. They are fully-functioning ecommerce sites, with a realistic inventory, a full suite of active social media accounts, but with a distinct tinge of...fraud.<p>Take this one, for example:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homespacedecor.com&#x2F;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;homespacedecor<p>Street view of their address in Houston: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;fakpcpmGyytGRt167<p>Is it just me, or has this problem recently gotten worse? Are these organized carding scams? Has there been any good investigative reporting about it?",
