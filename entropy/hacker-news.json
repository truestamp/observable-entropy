      "text": "I understand the high level reasoning is “government corruption”, but I’m trying to understand what efforts have been made to allow people to rip their own lawfully purchased media. Are any congresspeople fighting to repeal this section of the DMCA? Has any legislation been proposed? Which senators are most firmly advocating for this overt MPAA rent seeking? Why is this not as popular as “right to repair” considering how many more people this impacts? This is a pretty wide-open question, so anything people can add to help me understand this history of this conflict is welcome.<p>For those who don’t know, Section 1201 makes it illegal to break any DRM or to make or distribute software useful for this purpose. The effect is that people who have a valid license to the content must pay over and over to consume that content (once for blu-ray, once for Apple TV, once for Amazon, etc).",
