      "text": "Hi all,<p>My dad (67) died from covid complications one week ago, and I&#x27;m simply numb. I think on all the variations of what-ifs that could have avoided his infection, or in different ways in which he could have been treated much earlier whatsoever. He was a great man and I loved him very much, but even though I still have my mother and my sister, I feel robbed of more time with him.<p>I am in my forties, so not a youngster any more, but I still hate all of this.<p>This post is more like a cry for help on how to deal with death, from a practical viewpoint. I feel powerless, and even at work I feel so demotivated. My boss and colleagues told me that I can take all the time I need, but there is also so much paperwork to do after one dies, that I end up exhausted and without seeing the meaning of doing anything at all.",
