      "text": "I have a well established phone checking habit.<p>If I&#x27;m developing and my tests are running I pick up my phone. If my phone is in my peripheral vision I will pick it up at some point to check what&#x27;s happening on it. If I&#x27;m working on a problem and I&#x27;m not sure exactly what to do I pick up my phone (to sooth my nerves).<p>I don&#x27;t like the habit, but I have it.<p>I used to pick up my phone to check online dating sites a lot, but now I am less interested in them. So I find myself picking up my phone and not really being sure what to do with it when it is in my hands.<p>There are two directions I can go in (I think):<p>1. Stop picking up my phone as much. This means my brain needs to get better at holding that boring period where there are no inputs. (I must be a dopamine addict)<p>2. Find something more interesting to look at when I pick up my phone (by the morning I will already have checked Reddit and the news, so need something new).<p>Does anyone have any ideas of interesting apps to look at that could turn this habit into something productive?<p>Does anyone have any success getting more comfortable &quot;holding&quot; the boredom? (Maybe I should buy a Rubik&#x27;s cube?!)",
