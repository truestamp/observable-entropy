      "text": "I’ve been mulling this over again after seeing the online outrage over Bandcamp’s acquisition. I think people were really upset because they see Bandcamp as an indie platform that tries to do The Right Thing by artists by staying small and taking a relatively small cut of sales to run the service.<p>I feel pretty mixed about it. I’m happy for the founders and early employees getting rewarded for their hard work but recognize that it’s the end of an era for bandcamp since their profit motivation and sense of ownership won’t be there for much longer. As a tech-optimist I’m excited about futuristic new platforms that could flourish in it’s place.<p>That said, I don’t really want to philosophize about any of that here.<p>Instead, my question for all the builders on HN… how would you, both technically and organizationally, architect a version of Bandcamp that would last 1000 years instead of 15. And I mean, kudos on 15, that’s ages in tech but clearly a lot of people wanted more.<p>- What stack would you use and what infra would host it?<p>- Would it be an open source project?<p>- How would you organize and incentivize development?<p>A few thoughts to kick it off…<p>- We all know software’s gotta change over time as platforms and user expectations change. The computers we’re using in 20 years are going to crush what we’re on now and user expectations will update (though probably a lot slower than we usually think). So we need a mechanism to keep updating it.<p>- If it’s going to last, it should probably not be possible for a big co to take it over and cover it with ads or something.<p>Just some Sunday fun :).",
