The internet has also been the only portal for me to connect with like-minds, not just intellectually, but spiritually&#x2F;emotionally.<p>Overall if the internet didn&#x27;t exist, I would&#x27;ve lived in absolute oblivion and zero self-awareness, chugging along checking all the boxes until the end of life.<p>While some people might prefer to live without the internet and it&#x27;s &quot;distractions&quot;, I reckon a lot of people <i>depend</i> on the internet and the web, for escape, for comfort, for connection, for existence.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but some days, it seems the internet is the only thing that feels real.",
