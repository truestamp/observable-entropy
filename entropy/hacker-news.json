      "text": "When username&#x2F;password based authentifiction ends for command line interaction (git push, git pull,...), I want to switch to SSH key based authentication. Since I have not much experience here I want to explore best practices.<p>My scope:<p>I have tons of repos on Bitbucket and Github owned by about 10 Bitbucket &#x2F; Github accounts. They are spread over multiple organizations and cannot be tied together.\nSome accounts I just need every few months. I need to access these repos from about 30 different git client machines.<p>Up to now I used usernames and passwords stored in a excel file. That worked well although I know about this pretty insecure way of handling credentials. But I had a perfect overview over all logins.<p>When switching to SSH key based authentication, things get more secure but also more complicated. Websites still use usernames&#x2F;password but command line interfaces require SSH keys. So we have more credentials to manage.<p>My questions are:<p>* What are best practices to manage private and public keys as well as all these usernames&#x2F;password for the web ui&#x27;s? \n* How keep a good overview over all git credentials?\n* Can I store SSH keys in my Excel-File?\n* How many SSH keys would you recommended for my scenario?<p>Before I get killed here for using Excel files for credential storage please note that I have about thirty+ years of excellent experience going that way, have tons of managed credentials and think that millions of users have similar practices.",
