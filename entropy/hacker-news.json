Governments pay to have full access to phone text, photos, audio and more.<p>2.  Apple released 14.7 l, includes security fixes of known exploits … but does not fix security hole used by pegasus<p>3.  Apple introduced plans to locally scan files for CSAM.  Promises not to scan things other than photos and search terms.<p>4.  Apple releases 14.71 more security fixes.  However does not patch the iMessage flaw still in use by Pegasus.<p>Almost as if Apple is getting back door access ready for governments prior to patching known major security flaw in iMessage affecting hundred of thousands (perhaps millions) iPhones.  Security flaw that essentially openly exploits iMessage and breaks any local device encryption.",
