But might it backfire?<p><pre><code>  __________________________\n</code></pre>\nDear Google:<p>We love you. We really do.<p>SO MUCH THAT WE SPENT $865,346.15 WITH YOU LAST YEAR. AND THIS YEAR WE WANT TO SPEND EVEN MORE.<p>But we&#x27;re having an issue with our Google Ads account and it&#x27;s preventing us from taking this beautiful relationship to the next level. Nothing major. Should be an easy fix. We just can&#x27;t seem to find the right person over there to help us fix it.<p>Please don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, your phone agents have been great and very friendly (especially Surabhi, we could talk to her all day) but they&#x27;ve been unable to point us in the right direction and, as a small company that relies on your awesome Googleness for much of our success, we&#x27;re growing concerned.<p>Any chance someone over there could spare 5 minutes for us and make our dreams come true? We&#x27;d sure appreciate it.<p><pre><code>  Much (much) love,\n  Corey Newhouse - Founder &amp; CMO\n  ICG America, Inc.\n  &lt;phone&gt;</code></pre>",
