      "text": "Its been more than 2 3 years thinking of starting a startup but i kept thinking and thinking about what should i do, what match my skillset and interest, whats the problem that i can solve soo many questions on the row but i&#x27;m very uncertain even till now. Everyday I wakeup thinking  to do something but later before bed the same thought hit again and again that i couldnt do anything. I tried to explore many things and tried to meet many people to match my interest and for ideas . Its not that i didnt came with any idea , but the ideas im caming up with does match my skillset or sometimes it may be too expensive.<p>bUT the  struggle will be kept going until i  wake up and end this dream and make a reality.",
