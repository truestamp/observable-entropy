      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;ve recently released the MVP version of Rebudget, a personal finance app that I&#x27;ve been working on-and-off over the last 2 years. \nRebudget helps you create a budget and track your personal finances using the zero-based budgeting or the envelope method. I originally \nstarted working on this mostly as a fun side project to experiment and see what I could do, but also as a potential Mint&#x2F;YNAB replacement \nfor myself (as well as my wife&#x27;s spreadsheet!).<p>There is still a lot of work to be done (it may be a little rough around the edges in some places), but I&#x27;m excited about the challenges and work ahead.<p>I&#x27;m open to any questions or feedback that is provided. Thanks!",
