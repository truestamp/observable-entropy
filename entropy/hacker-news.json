      "text": "I have a potential client that has a list of features and changes he wants for an existing internal app. He would like me to make a proposal.<p>However, as:\n- I haven&#x27;t seen this internal app\n- nor have I seen the code\n- nor do I know if this guy is going to be nit-picky<p>making a proposal seems futile. A feature can take 4 hours, or 4 days, I don&#x27;t know.<p>At my normal job I just work in sprints, which work great as every party involved knows what is expected from each other. So I would like to propose he takes on a couple of sprints from me, and we can discuss together what feature has priority.<p>Does anyone have experience doing it this way?\nWhat would be the best way to approach this?<p>Thanks",
