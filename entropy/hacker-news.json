      "text": "This is from the perspective of someone on the IT side, non-dev, in the corporate trenches (2k-3k person org).<p>1) I like the people I work with, I moderately like the work I&#x27;m doing, but one of the constant blockers for having work done is that it runs through the CTO to complete stuff, like ordering equipment&#x2F;software. They have explicitly stated before that the company doesn&#x27;t have any issues spending yet they want to be involved in every approval, which can 1-2 weeks.<p>2) I&#x27;m trying to convince myself of the Amazon &quot;disagree and commit&quot; mantra but maybe I am not emotionally mature enough to do so? For some of the proposals and teams that I think have a high chance of failure and really don&#x27;t move the needle on the change this person wants to see, I want to be able to shrug and tell myself that it is what it is but the thing is I&#x27;ll be forced to but time and energy into mitigated it if it does fail.<p>Plenty of people would say &#x27;Look for something else&#x27; but I was already passed up for role by this person because of my &#x27;lack of experience&#x27;. The person that then took the role, when I passed over my docs and proposals, said they were amazing and they look forward to working on it. I&#x27;ve found myself at crossroads, don&#x27;t really know where to go in the working world because I keep running into barriers like the above where I question if I&#x27;m even fit to work in a company at all.<p>Thanks for any advice.
