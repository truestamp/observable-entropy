There are already more than 5 employees (including CEO, etc.), but less than 10.<p>Besides a salary, he has been offered around .2% of the total shares, vesting over 4 years.<p>Is that about the right amount? My gut feeling is that it is too low.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what &quot;similarly early&quot; employees have been offered at other startups. Examples would be welcome.",
