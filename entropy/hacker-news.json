      "text": "Looking for advice from seasoned devs. How do you resolve a situation where stakeholders (product teams, etc.) are giving you specifications to implement rather than requirements to design solutions for?<p>Context:<p>* Joined a new company.\n* New major project.\n* We have a product manager for our dev team (the platform is our team&#x27;s product) but he&#x27;s new.\n* All of our requirements coming through him from product contain specific implementation details.\n* Talking to other devs, this has been an issue for a while.\n* It&#x27;s creating a ton of churn&#x2F;confusion.<p>What we get: &quot;Enable CRUD permissions to $RESOURCE for $USER_TYPE.&quot;<p>What we need: &quot;As $USER_TYPE, I want to be able to do $THING in $PRODUCT, so that I can $REASON_THIS_IS_NEEDED.&quot;<p>When we ask why, it turns out that what they&#x27;re actually trying to accomplish is something else entirely, and could be easily accomplished by an existing component, or shouldn&#x27;t even be done in the first place.<p>Talking to our other devs, this is a chronic issue. We&#x27;ve wasted 6 weeks of our project so far because non-engineers have been trying to design engineering solutions that we eventually had to explain weren&#x27;t necessary&#x2F;optimal&#x2F;possible, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I have enough political&#x2F;social capital to raise the issue directly, and everyone else seems too timid.<p>Has anyone been here before? What&#x27;s the right solution?",
