      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;ve got a job now that&#x27;s been pretty good to me so far, but a recent change in circumstances has put a bad taste in my mouth. As such, I&#x27;m considering other options. I do site reliability engineering work, though I could transition into full software if I wanted. I&#x27;ve got about 15 years of experience so it would be for a senior role.<p>One concern I have is accidentally stumbling into a company with a twisted, woke culture that will see me ostracized if I don&#x27;t self-flagellate (being a white man) and engage in performative social justice. I could probably bring the odds of that down to about 0 if I avoid anything in say, urban California and NYC but that really cuts down on the available job opportunities in tech.<p>A few questions for you all:<p>1. How pervasive is this sort of work culture, actually? I get the impression that it&#x27;s common in some areas, like Silicon Valley, but that could easily be a misconception.<p>2. Do you have any tips for detecting this kind of culture before signing on at a new company?<p>3. Any specific companies you can recommend looking into? I have roots where I am and not willing to move, so remote work flexibility is a must.<p>Thanks!",
