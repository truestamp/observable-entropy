Only recently I have come to understand that a lot about my personality is quite static. Given this it feels like I can be manipulated and therefore my decisions can be sold to the highest bidder. Is there still hope?",

I used to be a firm believer in Crashplan for both my Linux servers as well as my Mac development machines, but Crashplan really doesn&#x27;t play well with all the new automatic syncing stuff that Apple has (like fetching copies of your images and files only when necessary) and Dropbox&#x27;s intelligent sync things. On my Macs Crashplan is always mired in some high CPU activity and consuming disk space. And they stopped supporting Linux machines that don&#x27;t have a graphical environment (yes I know all the tricks for managing it remotely and they&#x27;re worse).<p>So long story short, what are people using to reliably backup their machines without a lot of fuss? Most services don&#x27;t support Macs or they don&#x27;t support Linux, or they don&#x27;t do infinite revisions.",
