      "text": "I was trained in Ecology and then as a Civil&#x2F;Environmental Engineer in the 1980&#x27;s but shifted quickly to computers as &quot;the tools&quot; that will change the world (and they did) and rode the wave of information systems in different industries.<p>Retired now, I am shifting my attention back to Building Science, Solar and Energy Engineering to work on solutions to climate change. I am refreshing understanding and first principles with classes offered by Edx, MIT, and other places but they do not discuss tooling, so far. Mostly theory and understanding. Homework uses calculators, pencil and paper - still important.<p>Here, I have been reading the threads on learning math and physics but am not finding threads on modern tooling supporting applied use of math and physics - such as engineering.<p>To skill up, what are the current, &quot;modern&quot; tools and skills to refresh, learn, and use to be useful in the efforts to address climate change?",
