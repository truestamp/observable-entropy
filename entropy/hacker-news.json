      "text": "I know it sounds far-fetched, by I am wondering.<p>I had my newly created eBay account permanently cancelled, with no appeal, today.<p>The account had a single item (a Svalt cooling dock) for sale, and the description and text was similar to an existing Svalt item on the site.<p>The only thing in the account that could be flagged as &#x27;suspicious&#x27; is the email. I used Apple ID and I did hide my email, so the resulting email is something like:\n `xyz4rt5uiosshpv@privaterelay.appleid.com` (not the real one)<p>I wonder if that&#x27;s what flagged the account, but as usual in these cases, there&#x27;s nothing the support team will tell me or do to help (which I understand, they have their hands tied by internal policies)<p>So, I was wondering, had anyone else here had a similar issue? And, what other platform did you use to sell stuff after that?",
