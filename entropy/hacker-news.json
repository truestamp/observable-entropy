      "text": "The word “research” tends to evoke ideas of long, expensive academic careers you have to put in until you can be considered qualified for industrial R&amp;D type roles. But security research seems to be orthogonal to many fields that tend to focus less on  credentialism and more on proven past ability. It’s not uncommon software devs, other security roles, etc. to be able to break into to their respective fields self taught so is it possible for security research roles?<p>If so, how difficult is it to self teach this sort of stuff and how long would someone with a cursory understanding of exploits, security, etc. to be “ready” for a industrial role in this field. I get that’s a very open question, with widely varied answers based on individuals, but for comparison, it doesn’t seem to take software developers that show existing aptitude for the field very long to have the potential for productivity in a industrial setting. Hell there are entire industries around pumping out new programmers in 6mo-1y, and while they may not all be top of the line, if good at all, getting your foot into the door seems to be the biggest step into separating those who are and getting them into the right track.",
