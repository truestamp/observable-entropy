      "text": "Hi HN - Here’s a question that I hope will generate some useful comments, suggestions and links.<p>Background for question: I normally run an internal DNS resolver with an upstream pool of 10-15 providers. These are normally a mix of Global Anycast servers (Quad9 etc) with some OpenNIC, YandexDNS etc thrown in towards the end to cover the ‘chilling effects’ blackholes.<p>Currently Yandex DNS is pinging out (either due to black-holing or DDOS’ing depending on where I connect To&#x2F;From).<p>My question to HN is this – Given my ‘Information Wants To Be Free’ viewpoint, are there any DNS equivalents of Switzerland (WWII, Neutral to all parties) providers?",
