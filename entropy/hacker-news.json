Wasteful (unrealistic preparation and holding times, non-necessary packaging).<p>! Stressful work environment (too many expectations on the employee).<p>! Unrealistic preparation and holding times.<p>! Bad employee treatment and pay.<p>&gt; Offer discount on non-fresh food items that are still good to eat.<p>&gt; Invest in automation for doing inventories and statistics (customer count) via deep learning.<p>&gt; Increase prices (esp. for animal-based products) to make up for operating expenses.<p>&gt; Aim for a positive balance sheet (more cash&#x2F;assets than liabilities).<p>&gt; Reduce dividends or don&#x27;t increase them, if needed.<p>&gt; As a last resort, impose short working hours or lay offs (as bitter medicine).<p>&gt; Look out for: indoor farming (e.g. &quot;tomato&#x2F;lettuce growing indoors where customers see them&quot;).<p>&gt; Add reasonable buffer times (preparation) and automate where appropriate (visual cues, let AI recommend where an empoyee fits best: cash register vs. kitchen).<p>&gt; Impose ban on overwork and aim to strive for an employee&#x27;s well-being.<p>&gt; Ensure adequuate health-insurance for all employees (including dental care, since employees need to be &quot;presentable&quot;.)<p>&gt; Have backup plans (peak customer flow).<p>&gt; Cut advertising, if needed. &quot;Go the Primark or Ferarri way&quot;.",

Later I have started learning html, css, and js to become a frontend developer. Later I have studied and worked in FOREX for almost a year and once again it bored me. So, I started a new job that eventually led to managing a development team, alongside I started learning about SEO to handle that part myself. After quitting that company, I have continued learning about data science, ML, and DL. It adored me and I have gained some experience in that field. However, after years of changing fields, I have decided to start frontend development once more. Am I crazy or what?",
