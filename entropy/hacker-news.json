      "text": "Hi,<p>I am Robbert, creator of JavaScript Excel-like data table library DataGridXL (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datagridxl.com). I made this component since similar products are quite slow &amp; unreliable.<p>I just released version 2 of the product and decided to add a few &quot;Comparison Pages&quot; to my website, to show visitors why my product is better (when it comes to performance &amp; reliability).<p>Now, the most well known JavaScript Excel-like data table libary has sent me a Cease And Desist Letter by email (twice) demanding that I take this Compare page (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;compare-handsontable) offline. I am not much of a legal rights expert, but so far I have ignored it. I can publish whatever I want, right? Freedom of speech?<p>So far I have just laughed it off and considered it very childish for a 20 person company to try to pressure me into taking this page offline. However, I could use the advice of the Hacker News community.<p>What should I do here? Ignore or take action?",
