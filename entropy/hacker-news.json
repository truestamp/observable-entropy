I&#x27;m now extremely bored and realizing all I&#x27;m doing is pushing Kafka messages and writing Java micro-services, leaving me with this daily existential dread of not advancing my career or knowledge.<p>Despite spending a lot of my time reading, learning and admiring tech, I&#x27;m sitting in my office wanting bigger and better opportunities so I can grow into a solid engineer. I&#x27;ve never had a mentor and despite seeking out mentors, I&#x27;m not sure how to really go about finding one that can provide guidance like this. I want to have opportunities to dive deep and become smarter, but realizing I don&#x27;t really know how to best go about this.<p>Money isn&#x27;t everything, however, I do still need a job to keep me afloat as my partner and I live in a high cost of living area (for her job).",
