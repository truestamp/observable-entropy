      "text": "Hi,<p>In March 2020 I got a job offer for a major software company in Canada. I have been waiting for my work visa since then.<p>I picked Canada because common sense said its immigration system was excellent. I have learned from experience it is far from that. After over a year waiting and with no light at the end of the tunnel, I&#x27;m mentally depleted and am considering giving up and trying someplace else.<p>My questions: do you have firsthand experience on immigrating during the Covid pandemic? Do you know of countries that sponsor works visas right now? I&#x27;ll probably end up waiting (sunken cost fallacy), but if anything it would be reassuring to know there are other options.",
