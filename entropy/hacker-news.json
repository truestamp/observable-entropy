      "text": "I’ve been trying to track my “wins” since Solarwinds - times my verbal advice was ignored and a severe issue resulted.<p>From my perspective (having mostly worked in academia or nonprofits with w brief stint as a sandwich artist), the focus seems to be on highly quantitative solutions. Folks gather extremely large datasets of quantitative data when sometimes just a couple Twitter lists combined with the HUMINT of attending conferences for over a decade has primed my gut so I can make pretty good guesses.<p>My concern is that access to these large datasets is gatekept - that good threat analysis could be done with extremely simple exploratory data analysis often done in the social sciences… basic graphs and summary statistics not full on Edward Tufte style graphs.<p>I’m probably poorly articulating but are there any entities that take a more qualitative approach to threat analysis?<p>(For example, I’ve gotten in the habit of taking a 5s video of someone’s mutuals with me when I follow - it feels like sometimes there’s an odd focus on “open” source intelligence when someone at a large company could probably do much more with the same data.",
