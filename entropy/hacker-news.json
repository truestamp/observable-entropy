      "text": "A couple years ago I started working for a Dutch startup. I was offered an equity package, but didn&#x27;t think much of it at that time. After going through a couple of funding rounds, well, I started looking into it. The Dutch structure is called STAK and is basically a company-in-a-company without any voting rights. Currently it is about 6% of company stock divided among 10 employees. I&#x27;m still very well aware that it could be worth 0 EUR in the end. I also very well aware of tricks being played by investors and engineers being squeezed out of their faire share. Since money came, it all about scaling up and getting a good exit.<p>A month ago I (and the other engineers) were finally able to sign the original STAK equity contract. It was apparently an additonal contract. This might be negligence on my side, but I simply didn&#x27;t know. The equity package and vesting scheme is briefly mentioned in my initial contract. In this new contract the vesting scheme changed and included a lot of additional company and personal goals to be achieved. So it is not only time-based now. (it was said this was for tax reasons). Due to this it makes it a lot harder to vest any additional stock (about half would probably impossible to vest).<p>I&#x27;m on good terms with the founders and I think it is possible to renogatiate this. But I don&#x27;t know where to start. I read a lot about equity packages at American startups, but this probably doesn&#x27;t apply for my situation. Can anyone offer me advice\n- What to do best?\n- How do I make sure what I vest, I really do vest and they don&#x27;t change the rules again?\n- Is it worth anything (even after an exit).\n- The additional goals were set because of tax authority rules (is this a straight out lie)?",
