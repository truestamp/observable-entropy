Regardless of whether I use CRDTs during transport, whenever I update my database state, I will still have to do some kind of locking beit pessimistic or optimistic before writing data.<p>Unless there is a DB which accepts CRDTs, OTs or some kind of patchsets as part of its DSL and it handles the concurrency internally? Are there any such databases?<p>Effectively a very sophisticated version of the `UPDATE` command.",
