      "text": "I took a remote job 8 weeks ago at a high-growth startup as an engineer (no junior &#x2F; senior modifier). I was fairly aggressively recruited by the CEO. I&#x27;ve only ever worked remotely because of COVID, and this is the first large(r) company I&#x27;ve worked for.<p>I had felt the job was going pretty well -- the tech stack is somewhat unfamiliar so I&#x27;ve been getting up to speed and not as productive as some of my team members, and I&#x27;d missed a couple morning standups due to timezone differences and insomnia, but I&#x27;d been talking to my coworkers often, video calling, etc., and we seemed to have a good rapport, and they&#x27;d complimented me on my work multiple times.<p>I saw a meeting with a person I didn&#x27;t recognize suddenly appear on my calendar in the morning without any notice. I thought it was weird, but figured they were a new person and we&#x27;d just be getting to know each other. They were instead an engineering manager I&#x27;d never met before -- not my immediate manager or the CTO.<p>He started talking about my performance being an issue: that I&#x27;d been missing lots of meetings, and not completing enough points per sprint. I was taken aback, it was early in the morning, so I mostly just &quot;uh-huh&quot;&#x27;d and agreed with what he was saying, which may have been a mistake. The meeting was also only 30 minutes before I had to demo a feature to the engineering team, which ended up being pretty scattershot as a result.<p>After the meeting, he sent an email, cc&#x27;d to the CTO, my manager, and HR, basically saying the same things: that I needed to have better attendance at meetings and make a certain number of points per sprint, or my employment would be at risk.<p>I totally understand why those things are important and I&#x27;ve been working on improving both and trying to get up to speed faster, but I was really taken aback by the suddenness: I hadn&#x27;t heard anything from my manager that there was an issue beforehand (I went back through Teams to check and didn&#x27;t see anything).<p>Am I misunderstanding the situation, and this is just how large companies work? What should I say to my immediate manager &#x2F; other people in this story?",
