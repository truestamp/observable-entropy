      "text": "So heres my problem.<p>We&#x27;re launching a new app this month and want to roll out in phases. We want 1% of the users to use the app the first week. We want another 10% the next, then 40, then 80... you get the point.<p>I&#x27;m trying to find a tool to help us do this. Something like Google Optimize for split traffic? Or perhaps another tool for creating user groups and assigning them to a certain path.<p>Does anyone have any good ideas or have you done this in the past.<p>I could really use some help.",
