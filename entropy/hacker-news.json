      "text": "Hi there.\nI wrote a CircleCI API (V2) client in Go.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;grezar&#x2F;go-circleci<p>I want to share this library to you in this post.<p>You may be able to find another CircleCI api client written in go, but as far as I can see, I couldn&#x27;t find one that is actively maintained and supports the V2 API.<p>The client I wrote is compatible with the v2 API of CircleCI and covers most of the API it provides.<p>However, many of the methods are not yet used in real projects, so some of them may not work well.\nI plan to iterate on the release for a while and it could be involved some breaking changes.\nIf you are interested in using it, please try it out and give us feedback via GitHub Issue if you have any problems.<p>Thanks.",
