      "text": "When I power an iPad off (latest available device and software) while its battery is at 100% charge, after a week or so of it sitting in a drawer, its battery is completely drained of power and it can no longer boot up without recharging. If I do the same with my nintendo gameboy advance, the device still boots up and has almost full charge even after a year of sitting in a drawer, powered off. Why is this happening? What am I missing?",

When you have a production system running, every now and then there are requirements to made a DB update because of some bug in the code, or for some use cases which were not thought of earlier. How do you handle such updates?<p>The common way I know is the access is given to a small number of trusted people who make the updates. Are there any other ways or best practices such that the small set of people don&#x27;t end up becoming bottlenecks, apart from the potential risk of abuse of trust.",
