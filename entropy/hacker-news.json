In recent months we&#x27;ve seen a close competitor sign up for our SaaS service (using email addresses and names that clearly identify who they are) and experiment with the platform. This is a similar sized startup in the exact same market as us, competing over the exact same customers.<p>Is there anything we should or even can do about this? Or is this form of competitive research simply unavoidable?<p>We also have an open source offering which obviously everyone can try and even reuse. We&#x27;re ok with that, of course",
