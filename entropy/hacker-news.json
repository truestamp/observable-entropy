      "text": "Hey all,<p>Looking through my missed calls, I see I’ve gotten 18 spam calls in the last week. At this point I’m quite disappointed with both Verizon and the FCC.<p>What’s particularly concerning is that it seems spam callers are somehow aware of my location. Last month I traveled out of state to Texas. Since then about half of the calls are from TX area codes.<p>Has anyone else noticed a similar phenomenon? I know there’s nothing I can do at this point but silence unknown numbers and change my voicemail to the tone for a disconnected line.<p>It’s quite absurd how the telecom industry has let things progress to this point. I don’t see how it could lead to anything but a negative impact on their business from such a terrible customer experience.",
