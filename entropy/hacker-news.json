Now this has been discussed broadly, and somehow everyone seems to have their own opinion about SO&#x27;s problems.<p>I recently read a short rant [2] about it on Meta, and now I wonder:<p>Could an expert-only, <i>high quality</i> SO alternative work? Restricted access is hard to enforce, but some basic RegEx captcha and adjusted rules and moderation might help a lot.
