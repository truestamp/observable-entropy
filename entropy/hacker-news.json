I&#x27;m super interested in Web3 – especially DAOs – and would like to contribute more and more to them. However, I&#x27;d like to start as a part-time contributor to understand if the space really is a good fit for me.<p>There are ok-ish platforms like Gitcoin I&#x27;ve used for finding projects. Yet, it feels a bit random which projects you find (and they always seem to be from the same protocols...). I&#x27;d like to stay in track of the latest launches – every time I log in Twitter it feels like a new DAO has been launched. A massive FOMO that I miss something...<p>I know many of my peers face the same problem. That&#x27;s why my co-founder and I founded Kleoverse (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kleoverse.com&#x2F;). We gather together all DAOs &amp; open Web3 projects so that you can constantly find a stream of relevant work. Expect to find:<p>- All relevant DAOs – including those that were just launched!\n- Relevant open bounties\n- Available grant programs<p>All projects are always paid in tokens or other monetary rewards!<p>The selfish idea is to build ourselves a product that helps us to stay on track of the latest developments and get paid well in Web3. But in the same time, we want to help anyone to find the most relevant projects to get started today and earn decent income in Web3!",
