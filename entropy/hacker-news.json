I fully agree with this.<p>I used to be an occasional blogger, but had some okay traffic (a few posts took off), but definitely not a name for myself where I could take people with me to my own site. What I liked about Medium was their discoverability, shifting to my blog I believe will lose that discoverability.<p>Are there other platforms or other ways to get organic readership?",
