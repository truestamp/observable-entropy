      "text": "My apologies for this not being directly tech related, but I know there are many people here on HN with domain expertise in a broad array of industries.<p>A family member is experiencing new symptoms that were the precursor to discovering their cancer originally. Unfortunately at diagnosis, they were already stage 4.<p>The oncologist ordered a specific scan, the insurance company denied it, and then required a &quot;peer to peer&quot; meeting with the doctor. They forced the doctor&#x27;s hand to accept a different type of scan, which at an earlier point of treatment had returned a false negative for us. And the process is also causing, and has caused in the past, delays to treatment in an extremely time sensitive situation.<p>What can I possibly do about this peer to peer theater? There is absolutely no way the insurance companies&#x27; &quot;peer&quot; knows the latest details about the ever evolving treatment the oncologist is using. And this &quot;peer&quot; certainly knows nothing about my family member&#x27;s specifics when it comes to their treatment history.<p>How is this stuff even legal? I googled around and found this disturbingly similar situation blogged by a Dr. Rick Boulay in 2017:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kevinmd.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;dear-insurance-doctor-not-peer.html<p>Then I stumbled upon an old New York Times article that quoted him, about how doctors are sometimes lying to insurance agencies in order to get the treatment their patients desperately need:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;06&#x2F;21&#x2F;well&#x2F;the-strategic-lies-of-oncologists.html\n(archive: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;5lfkU#selection-505.42-505.45)<p>What the hell is going on? This is absolute madness.",
