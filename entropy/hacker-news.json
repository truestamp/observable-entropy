I&#x27;ve outsourcing the standard stuff (bookkeeping, financial ops, most writing) but I&#x27;m still drowning in a lot of one-off tasks.<p>I&#x27;ve tried one virtual assistant service, but I&#x27;ve been underwhelmed with the help I&#x27;ve been getting (been through 2 candidates so far). I&#x27;m really trying to not expect too much, but it would be nice to not field a million questions on what seems like a straightforward task.<p>I&#x27;m open to the idea that I&#x27;m doing a bad job of formulating tasks, and that this is a skill I need to get better at, but has anyone found success with hiring an assistant? Local&#x2F;virtual? What worked? How long does it take to have someone get your style? Do you know if its not a fit right away?<p>Any wisdom appreciated.",
