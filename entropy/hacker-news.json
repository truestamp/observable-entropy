      "text": "I&#x27;ve setup several k8s clusters on bare metal in the last few years, and by far the biggest challenges are storage and control plane corruption.<p>The last one is usually due to multiple etcd failure modes (corruption, daemon&#x2F;pod not starting, network&#x2F;port issues, ...) to the point where even with backups (restic, velero, etc) the cluster needs to be rebuilt.<p>So I&#x27;m considering using an RDBMS outside the cluster. Assuming I can guarantee availability and performance, what are the downsides of swapping etcd with a relational DB?<p>Thanks in advance.",
