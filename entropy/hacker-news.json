You can review the most up to date fees for international transactions on our pricing page.<p>You can contact us, and find more details about this pricing update, managing or closing your account, or any other next steps, on our dedicated support page.<p>- The Stripe team<p>---<p>Of course they don&#x27;t actually mention what the changes are, but looking at the pricing page [0], it seems like there is now an additional 1.1% (making it 2.5% in total) for EU companies taking UK payments and for UK companies taking EU payments.<p>I imagine this is related to Visa and Mastercard price increases post-Brexit?
