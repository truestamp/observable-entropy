      "text": "The Java Pathfinder Tool (JPF) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;javapathfinder&#x2F;jpf-core is a highly extensible Java virtual machine built for software verification. The project was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide.<p>If you want to learn more about JPF, we are having our annual JPF Day workshop on December 4th from 15:00-17:45 UTC where 4 JPF-related projects will be showcased. Additionally, we have a discord server set up for the event which you can join with the following invite link!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;dQvmMYkd8u",
