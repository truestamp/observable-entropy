      "text": "Is anyone working in project teams using &quot;plan, build, ship&quot; or no formal methodology project management environments?<p>I&#x27;m looking to learn from people who have had success repeatedly building cross-organizational project teams focused on specific outcomes.<p>For example, a team is tasked with &quot;Grow revenue of product X by Y %&quot; or &quot;Rework our dev env setup to reduce the time to productivity for joiners.&quot;<p>This is in contrast to back-to-back scrum-based sprints where an ongoing set of new tasks are pulled from a backlog and picked up by anyone with bandwidth and knowledge of the issue&#x27;s subject area.<p>These teams might be given little other guidance or required process, and the very ideas for these projects may come from ICs in engineering or bizops going about their normal tasks.<p>I&#x27;m curious about the full lifecycle, including the role of leadership support, evaluation of success, the breakup and re-formulation of these teams and what if any project management structures have worked well.<p>So far, I have not been able to put my hands on much description of this style of program management, though it is teased at in this recent Pragmatic Engineer article.
