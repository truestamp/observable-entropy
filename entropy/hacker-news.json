      "text": "Hi HN,<p>Is there any prior work in psychology or AI on what the minimum requirements for the average person to recognize something as conscious are?<p>Like for example what additional features would a Roomba need in order to be viewed by the average person as conscious? Is it just that society needs to be told that the entity is conscious, does it need to demonstrate some amount of free will, do we need to recognize that it has some similar biological machinery to us? Does it differ between cultures?<p>Someone must have studied this, I just can’t find the right keywords to find it on google.",
