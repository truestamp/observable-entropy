      "text": "Hey all, a friend asked me to write a small game for an art installation. The thought is a simple arcade-like game in a 16-bit style running on a Raspberry Pi 4. It just needs to store high scores so the SD card can run in read-only or append. Since it&#x27;s an art install, it needs to run 24&#x2F;7 for a few months if not a year or two while being interacted with by the public. I&#x27;m evaluating a few different options:<p>- Writing a simple bare-metal OS that runs on the hardware, no OS to worry about.<p>- Leveraging a slimmed-down OS like Ubuntu Core or Raspberry OS Lite and doing a godot&#x2F;pygame project (Godot seems somewhat of an unsupported path).<p>- Retropie&#x2F;others (I worry about this approach since I just want to run the one game and I&#x27;m worried about being able to exit out and break the illusion).<p>Any suggestions or recommendations? Does anyone have any experience with writing an arcade game&#x2F;running in a continual fashion? I won&#x27;t be there to fix it if it goes wrong, so reliability is key.",
