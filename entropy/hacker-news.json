      "text": "Hi HN community.<p>I&#x27;m working on a side project documenting personal accounts of San Francisco&#x2F;Silicon Valley tech culture.<p>My hope is to get a variety of perspectives with no specific expectations. The key criterion is having lived and worked (tech-adjacent is fine) in the area for some time (short times included).<p>I don&#x27;t want to lead the witness too much. Authentic views and experiences are my number one priority. That said, here&#x27;s some food for thought on potential remarks:<p>- your background and path to tech in SF&#x2F;SV;\n - the social dynamics in and outside of work;\n - personal connection to work, technology, and the area;\n - perceptions before, while, and after living in SF&#x2F;SV;\n - any of your unique experiences;\n - your outlook on the industry at large.<p>I&#x27;m not based in San Francisco, but I&#x27;m here for the month of April working on this project. Responses in writing (comments and DMs) and conversation (over video or in person) are equally appreciated! Thank you in advance for your time and openness.",
