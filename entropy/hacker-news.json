(Maybe not so fun, moves slowly)<p>Machine Learning and Crypto seem in comparison really interesting fields but they may not pan out. (higher risk)<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for the opinion of more veteran players on how they made their decisions in the younger years and if you have any advice.<p>Thanks in advance :)",
