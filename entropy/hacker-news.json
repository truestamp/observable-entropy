She has emailed about a dozen professors, and she&#x27;s having a lot of trouble getting any of them to even respond back to her emails, let alone getting any information. Since most schools seem to require reaching out to a professor first, this has become a substantial blocker.<p>I was curious if anyone here who worked in academia knew of a better way to contact professors than just a random email for this kind of thing. Would it make sense to try and call them, or send a physical letter?<p>NOTE: Her location is the United States.",
