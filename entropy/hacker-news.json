      "text": "A little bit of backstory: Recently I read&#x2F;listened to Make Time by Jake &amp; JZ, in which they mentioned that daily news is overrated and only checking news once in a week should be sufficient. This has stuck with me.<p>Now I&#x27;m looking for an app&#x2F;site that will curate news weekly. All the apps that I&#x27;ve looked into (Google news, Apple news, NewsInShorts, etc.) serve the purpose of instant news. I can check the news once a week but that means only the most recent news is served up and I need to scroll way down for older relevant articles.<p>Is there a site that curates news of 1 week and serves in level of relevance.<p>Thanks for reading and any help is appreciated",
