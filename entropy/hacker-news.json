      "text": "Hi all,<p>I&#x27;m looking to take out a $250k loan that uses some startup equity I own as collateral (the FMV of that equity comes in at ~$650k).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the company is 4-5 years old and isn&#x27;t a brand name like, e.g., Uber. That&#x27;s to say I&#x27;d expect industry knowledge would be required to fully appreciate the value of the equity (e.g. investor names, usage metrics, etc).<p>Who offers loans of this kind?<p>I don&#x27;t imagine I can, e.g., walk into my local Chase branch and strike up a good loan for this, right?<p>Thanks!",
