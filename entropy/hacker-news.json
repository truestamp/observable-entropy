      "text": "Hello everyone!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a solution that will allow me to write my front-end application in PHP. Why? - I wouldn&#x27;t say I liked the idea of using Node js on my servers for server-side rendering using Vue or Angular. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I work with .NET, Node js, Angular, and React every day at work and have nothing against it. But I needed a simple component with some data from a server and rendered using a template for my side-project. So, I started to think, can I convert my PHP code into Javascript? - Sure I can. Classes will become functions, private properties - local variables. Protected and the public will become public properties, etc. Something like this:<p>class TodoApp extends BaseComponent\n{\n    public string $text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    public array $items = [];<p><pre><code>    public function handleSubmit()\n    {\n        $this-&gt;items[] = $this-&gt;text;\n        $this-&gt;text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    }</code></pre>\n}<p>will become:\nvar TodoApp = function () {\n    var $this = this;\n    this.text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    this.items = [];<p><pre><code>    this.handleSubmit = function (event) {\n        $this.items.push($this.text);\n        $this.text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    };</code></pre>\n};<p>By following that pattern, I designed a first working prototype. It was pretty good but most important - it supported SSR out of the box. Later I added more and more features, like templating engine, reactivity, built-in PHP functions support, etc. And I could not stop. I continue improving it every day in my free time. As of today, Viewi is a fully functional tool for building full-stack and reactive web applications.<p>Link with some examples:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;<p>Documentation\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs<p>Architecture design and idea\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;architecture\nand here\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;introduction<p>Tutorial\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;tutorial<p>GitHub project\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viewi&#x2F;viewi<p>I hope you will find something useful for yourself. Feel free to ask questions or leave feedback.<p>Thank you!",
