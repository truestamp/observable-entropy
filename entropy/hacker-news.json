      "text": "I&#x27;ve spent the last several months going though a  FAANG interview.  A recruiter reached out to me and said they were hiring for remote.  I got a hiring manager on board, spent evenings and weekends preparing for the coding and design interviews, and made it to the last step - my application had to go through a hiring committee.<p>The hiring committee said no, they didn&#x27;t want remote hires.<p>I have friends in arguably worse situations.  They were recruited for remote positions, accepted the jobs, and are now being told they have to show up onsite.  When they pointed out they had been hired as remotes they were met with a collective shrug - the job opening didn&#x27;t say remote, the agreement they signed didn&#x27;t say remote.  The recruiter was wrong but that&#x27;s not the company&#x27;s problem.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the compensation model for recruiters is, but it seems to encourage bringing in as many candidates as possible over treating them with honesty and respect.",
