We parse your followers bios and then do some keyword analysis to determine interests, occupations, and other keywords. We also grab all of the available public metrics that Twitter&#x27;s API offers, like followers, follows, likes, etc...<p>If this sounds interesting, feel free to reach out on Twitter or just shoot us a note at email at wildfire.so, and I will give you an HN discount!<p>We&#x27;re curious what use cases this might support or what value people might gain from this. We have a hunch that the answer is basically zero. People like the data, but aren&#x27;t sure what else to do with it. In posting here, I was hoping folks of HN might have some ideas.<p>Let me know what you think!",
