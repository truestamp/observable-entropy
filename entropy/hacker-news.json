      "text": "All mail clients suck. It seems every single one needs a lot of configuration effort to have a decent experience, most of them have really slow search, and several of them have unrecoverably deleted messages seemingly at random. I&#x27;m tempted to try managing my email using Git, one file per email. It&#x27;ll be super fast and reliable, and I won&#x27;t have to ever worry about losing my emails after they are safely copied to several separate devices. Is this feasible? Specifically:<p>- Is there any decent software to save all messages from the IMAP server to one file per message on a regular basis? They&#x27;d have to at least have some sensible filenames, like date + subject.<p>- Are there any Linux and Android clients which will read files from such a folder? I don&#x27;t mind to `adb push` the repository if necessary, but if I have to read them using a text editor that&#x27;ll be a blocker.",
