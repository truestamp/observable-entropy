      "text": "I stumbled across an interesting app called “CrimeFlare” and what it does is reveal the real IP website’s using Cloudflare’s Ddos Mitigation Service.<p>CloudFlare had it taken down. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zidansec&#x2F;CrimeFlare<p>I’m assuming it does this by scanning the public internet in it’s entirely.<p>This is obviously a huge threat to CloudFlare’s entire business model and it totally makes sense that they want to bury this.<p>I just fail to understand what grounds they have to take something like this down. Internet IPs are public knowledge and these websites are publicly accessible. Just because Cloudflare built a billion dollar buisness exploiting the fact that sites “real” IPs can be hidden through obscurity, doesn’t mean they should be able to censor&#x2F;takedown apps that expose the flaw in their business plan!<p>Anyways, I intend to create a new internet-wide scanning system in order to revive the functionality of  CrimeFlare just to prove a point that security through obscurity is no security and all, and that CloudFlare doesn’t have the right to take something like this down!",
