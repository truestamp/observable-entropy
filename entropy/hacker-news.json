      "text": "With respect to the arbitration terms found in any given Terms of Service, there are two competing ideas I&#x27;ve seen a lot on HN recently:<p>1) Those asserting arbitration is a scam or otherwise unfair. The company whose TOS you&#x27;ve signed is the one paying the arbitrator, after all. This system is designed for you to lose.<p>2) Those with personal anecdotes about going through arbitration, who had a decent-at-worst experience, and ended up winning.<p>If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned from the internet, it&#x27;s that positive outcomes generate a light breeze, but negative outcomes generate a storm. If arbitration was inherently unfair -- at least as often as we seem to tell ourselves -- I&#x27;d think I&#x27;d see more anecdotes about it. So far I&#x27;ve seen zero. Maybe that&#x27;s just &quot;luck&quot;, but I figured I&#x27;d ask, directly to the community whose discussions about it prompted to this question.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a fan of the de-facto forced arbitration imposed on anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to (or can&#x27;t) run their own email server, etc. I&#x27;ve been deeply dismayed by the last few SCOTUS decisions on this subject. And yet I haven&#x27;t come across an anecdote of anyone getting boned. Indeed, in my own social circle I know 2 folks who have been through such arbitration. They both assumed the deck was stacked against them, and they both emerged victorious.",
