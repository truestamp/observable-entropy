What are problems with the way these are currently handled in your opinion? How do you suggest we fix it?<p>Nothing is perfect and there is always room for improvement. So if you were in charge of your own company, how would you look for and interview people to hire?<p>Or if you don&#x27;t think there are any problems with the current systems, please share why!",
