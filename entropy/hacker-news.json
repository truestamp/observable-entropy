      "text": "I&#x27;m working as the lead developer of a small team, and the boss just blindsided us with the news that we&#x27;re getting acquired. The plan seems to be that we&#x27;ll be a subsidiary for the near future but after that it&#x27;s up in the air. The acquiring company is in the same line of business and our software probably duplicates at least 50%. Our tech stack is completely different and our development team is much smaller. I feel like I&#x27;m at a career crossroads and I&#x27;m not sure how to proceed. I love the company as it was but I imagine that it&#x27;s going to change quite a bit. I&#x27;m not really a fan of their tech stack but I do only have limited experience with it. I&#x27;d like to move into doing more management and less coding, but I&#x27;m not sure if doing that in a tech stack I&#x27;m not fond of will be rewarding or grating.<p>Fellow HNers that have dealt with this, what did you do and how did it end up for you?",
