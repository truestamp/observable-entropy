      "text": "I read a lot of things online - blog posts, twitter threads, newsletters etc. But for a long time now, I&#x27;ve realized it really breaks my flow to be bombarded with this information overload during the course of my regular day. It takes my focus away from more productive work and the constant barrage is unsavory.<p>That said, I also want to consume some of this information. I want to read that post or that thread. I just don&#x27;t want to do it _now_. Of course, I can use something like a mailbrew or similar but it&#x27;s still online in nature.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear thoughts on a service that you send links to as you collect them. Just prior to end of month, the service prints it all in reader mode and ships them to you as a little book so you can read this stuff in peace, _offline_.",
