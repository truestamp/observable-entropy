      "text": "I used to have 3 displays and as time passes I find less and less use for extra display other than them being distration. A while back as an attempt to reduce distraction I moved to two displays (big primary and 24&quot; secondary). I think it is reducing distration but it might be just me assuming since I want the result to be less distraction and more focus.\nI wonder if anyone else has tried moving either way (to more displays or to reduce the number) and want to share experience.",
