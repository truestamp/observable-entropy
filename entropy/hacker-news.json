      "text": "I’m a self-taught web coder and have made some small CRUD systems for very targeted tiny clients during my professional life. I have also made a few hobby sites for fun just for myself.<p>I’d like to expand my skill set but I have trouble visualizing all the moving parts of a “big” web app and all the tools that go into it—when people talk about containers, or testing, or deploying such-and-such, I don’t have a clue. With HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS, I can spin up a little demo to play around and learn on another personal&#x2F;toy project, but how do I, as a solo person, learn about larger-scale technologies?<p>I’m a visual artist and print-based technician so front-end would probably be the place to focus. Is there a recommended path for going from hobby projects &amp; small sites to larger-scale best practices in React&#x2F;another important platform?",
