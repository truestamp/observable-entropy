      "text": "What I mean is that auto-correct often silently changes the second to last word thereby making it hard to notice. For me this introduces a significant amount of spelling errors that I only notice once it&#x27;s too late. Disabling auto-correct in the keyboard settings unfortunately doesn&#x27;t get rid of this behaviour.\nOften when I pick a suggestion it also adds an unnecessary space character.\nI fully expected this to be silently improved with iOS 15 and I just can&#x27;t wrap my head around such problems existing in the open for so long. Overall these editing warts give an unusually unpolished feel for such a basic task.<p>Meanwhile with Googles GBoard I don&#x27;t have these problems, get better suggestions and a much broader vocabulary which is very useful for entering words by swiping. The only reason I use the default keyboard is that GBoard for some reason makes long-hold-for-cursor buggy for me.",
