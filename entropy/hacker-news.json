      "text": "Hi HN Community,<p>We made a VS Code in the browser that can connect to any computer and lets you code together.<p>- It can connect to any mac &#x2F; linux device (your local computer or GCP &#x2F; AWS &#x2F; ...) - It supports extensions on Open VSX store. - You can edit together like google docs and also jump on voice calls and share your screen. - It uses webRTC for all communications. So none of your code goes through our servers.<p>You can try it at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tym.so&#x2F;signup?inviteCode=friend_of_tym\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tym.so&#x2F;signup?inviteCode=friend_of_tym</a>",

      "text": "My wife has ridiculous amount of manual tasks to do across a bunch of non integrated software every month.<p>Some of the software is out of date, there is 4 different apps&#x2F;databases plus excel she needs to click through on to process a single payment, plus checking. She now has the tasked swollen to the point she has to do at least 300-400 every end of month and it is now taking many hours of her time. Mostly unpaid overtime...<p>So it is entirely able to be automated, except the PC is the most heavily locked down thing I have ever seen, you can&#x27;t run portable apps, install browser extensions etc etc. Plus everything you try that is verboten sends a report back to HQ and after not many reports questions are asked.<p>Business is not interested in solving such problems, their answer is &quot;just spend an extra 20-30 hours a month riding the mouse&quot;. Well you can guess what I think of that.<p>So I think to automate this task with an external PC, HDMI capture card and maybe an Arduino or similar to generate mouse and keyboard commands, controlled by USB (serial) commands from the external automation PC.<p>Obviously with this method it is all shortcut keys and image matching for mouse co-ords to press, so Sikulux or some custom Python maybe.<p>Has anyone done this? I searched for quite a while and could not come up with any specific examples that anyone else had done anything similar.<p>I can&#x27;t see why it would be a big problem ,other than setup time and some potential fragility, but payoffs would be big. I&#x27;m surprised not more people have not had similar problems, am I missing something?",
