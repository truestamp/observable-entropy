      "text": "I am reaching 40 and been software engineer for 15 years. I am finally realizing that the main reason I got into programming was to start my own startup. Programming for others while still very satisfying is a little drag.<p>So I went a leadership route for a bit but the stress-level is through the roof. I feel like I am always negotiating. I am making $150K in Dallas TX.<p>A few of my friends have changed jobs recently and they are making over 200K as developers. They all are based in Dallas or Texas. This makes me want to go back to being a developer, have lower stress, and make more money.<p>Finally, I have long term plans to write books. I have set 25 years to deadline to become a full-time author. The reason for long deadline is because I have small kids, limited time to learn a new skill. And just want to be realistic.<p>Given all that information what should I do?<p>A: Keep my current job as a team lead and move further into management.<p><pre><code>   Pros: Flexibility because been here for so long, leadership skills don&#x27;t expire, eventually can make more money than as software devs\n\n   Cons: Less money for now, more stressful, stuck on a bad project at my current company\n</code></pre>\nB: Get a new job as a developer<p><pre><code>   Pros: Take advantage of current economy and enjoy more money immediately, less stress, more satisfying work.\n\n   Cons: Reset my flexibility&#x2F;influence, leetcode&#x2F;interviews, eventually I will old man competing with young grads.\n</code></pre>\nC: Some other option?",
