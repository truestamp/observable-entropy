I don&#x27;t have any way of recovering my account. I&#x27;ve tried everything I can think of and wanted to share my experience in case someone has gone through the same thing. Also, if you know anyone in Meta that can help that would be great. I&#x27;ve gone through all the help center suggestions for recovery. Also, the email notifications I received when the changes were made had &quot;recovery&quot; links that never worked. I appreciate anyones help in advance.",
