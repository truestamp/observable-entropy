I am going to start searching for a job in Japan or Germany to relocate there.<p>I am wondering what would be the best answer to &#x27;Why do you want to leave your current job?&#x27; as this question will definitely come up in the interviews.<p>My obvious reason is to relocate to a first world country but that&#x27;s not what I am going to tell them.<p>The product i am working on is a huge SPA but built in jQuery and vanilla JS. I feel like i am missing out on latest frontned stack and that will definitely hit my career in the future but not sure how i should phrase this as i don&#x27;t want to appear as i took a bad decision joining my current company.<p>Any suggestions on how should i tackle this question when it comes?",

      "text": "Hey HN. I am looking for experiences on how the Data Team is organised within your organisation. There are couple of insights from DBT[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getdbt.com&#x2F;data-teams&#x2F;data-org-structure-examples&#x2F;] and GitLab[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;business-technology&#x2F;data-team&#x2F;]. There are many different functions like infra, application engineers, pipelines, analytics engineers, analysts, DWH engineers, data modellers and so on ... . How do they work together? How ownership model is defined especially in modern SaaS world with GC, Azure and AWS providing more and more out of the box &quot;manage-free&quot; solutions. How do you manage enterprise applications and their integrations into tools? Do you have team per domain, team per tool and&#x2F;or team per function?",
