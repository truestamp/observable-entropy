      "text": "Hi friends! \nI want to share with you a piece of news that makes us very happy. My team and I have been working hard for a while to launch the 2. version of our trust-building platform, Inspakt 2.0, and the launch day is closer than a month now. It counts as just the beginning, but it is still very exciting! What makes it even more exciting is partnering with the #1 marketplace for entrepreneurs AppSumo and hopefully will launch right after the 2. version. Wish us luck!",
