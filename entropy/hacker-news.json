      "text": "So I&#x27;ve spent the entire day today trying to get one set of ads to run on Google Ads across multiple properties of theirs.<p>But the authoring tools are so awful! Sometimes the tabs hang, sometimes it looses data. You click the wrong thing and now it changed the campaign goal to be something else and you can&#x27;t revert the change and have to beginning from the beginning. The UX is terrible in itself, but the technical issues overshadow the lack of UX by simply making the whole thing appear broken most of the time.<p>I&#x27;ve tried multiple browsers, different accounts and the experience is the same: fucking awful.<p>If this is the best they can offer for their supposedly main source of income, how is the company even profitable? Am I just plain stupid because I can&#x27;t get things to work, or is this really the experience they offer people when they want to create ads in their network?",
