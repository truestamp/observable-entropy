      "text": "Hi there, has anybody here switched teams internally and had a positive&#x2F;negative experience they would like to share?<p>I recently decided to switch, today I told my (current) boss. He expressly asked me to stay with this team and told me he already had plans in place to solve the problems I raised. Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do. Do I cancel the transfer and believe him? I realize only I can make the decision for myself, but I am really torn.<p>I do love the team I&#x27;m on _except_ for one particularly toxic coworker who seems to have it out for me. I have stuck it out two years with this guy and had direct conversations, nothing has gotten any better. My boss explicitly told me he&#x27;d rather fire the other guy than lose me but I just don&#x27;t want this other guy to lose his job because I can&#x27;t deal with his toxicity. Everybody else on the team agrees he is unprofessional and rude, but also kind of shrugs their shoulders and have the &quot;its a job&quot; type attitude whereas I think life&#x27;s too short to work with people that make you feel small.<p>Stories and advice of all kinds are welcome.<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "I&#x27;m curious. Is it safe to do a registration though google forms for a small-time club which has legit professional reasons to gather your personal information. I know I can contact them directly and ask for alternatives. I am sure this would be a hassle for them. Yet it&#x27;s putting all my credentials out on somebody&#x27;s else&#x27;s account. I don&#x27;t know even if the information will be encrypted. The alternative would be emailing them directly and that&#x27;s the same thing?",
