I think it is time for me to move on as morale is low, my compensation has dropped significantly recently, and I no longer really feel motivated to work there. I am trying to figure out where to go next.<p>I went to this company because I believed it would be a good career builder, providing me with good experience and pay as my first job. I think it did both for a while, but I don’t really want to grind here anymore. The WLB and months-long timeline to do anything of significant value is too much.<p>I’m not sure if another MMANG company is for me right now. I think a small to mid-sized company where I believe in the mission and that can really utilize my distributed systems experience and directional skills would be much better for me right now.<p>However, I don’t really know how to find companies that would fit well. Can anyone offer ideas or resources for doing so?",
