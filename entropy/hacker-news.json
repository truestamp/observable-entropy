      "text": "By homework help, I mean doubts that are beyond basics. For eg-: I am Computer Engineering student(our course is 75% electronics engineering),and I am big data studying. I find myself in places where I am hell lot confused. The resources don&#x27;t suffice at all.<p>I get confused. But the issue is I get help from nowhere. Reddit NO. Stackexchange NO, other forums NO. How would I? As these subjects are studied by very few people as it is higher level of education question, how do I deal with this? Any guidance?<p>Sadly I don&#x27;t have any close friends whom I can ask.",
