      "text": "Specifically, how did you delete the connection your brain made between activity and failure?<p>Years ago, I tried to create my own little business. I failed. I tried to be persistent and worked till fatigue, depression, and anxiety attacks stopped me. I got into therapy, slowly rebuilt my life, feel pretty good now. I would even say it was a valuable experience.<p>However, it seems that the connection between writing&#x2F;coding&#x2F;building something and failure persists. I think I am not without creativity. I would love to try some side projects. But whenever I get excited about some idea and sit to work on it, my brain treats it like poison. The resistance is so strong I never make any progress.<p>I remember working on something all night and enjoying it so that when I finally went to bed, I was looking forward to continuing in the morning. How do I get this back?",
