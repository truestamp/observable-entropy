      "text": "Every time I google something, or go to re-open a closed google tab (gmail or calendar) on Safari, it auto closes a second or two later. It&#x27;s incredibly irritating. The second time I open the tab, it stays open.<p>I&#x27;m using a 16&quot; M1 max MacBook Pro. I use Safari because It&#x27;s more power efficient with all the tabs I have open and doesn&#x27;t constantly hound me to login.<p>I&#x27;ve been experiencing this for months since I got the laptop and have noticed a pattern of it occurring on Safari, only with google sites. Is this Apple screwing something up? Or is it google trying to make me switch to chrome? Or am I the only one that has this problem?",
