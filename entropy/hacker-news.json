Where are the people with currently $0 MRR who are struggling? We want to see those. Community is at its best when supporting each other. When they share their wins AND the Loses.<p>I&#x27;ll go first. I&#x27;m taking on a short challenge for 30 days - The goal is to reach 100 followers by the end of the month.<p>Share your current challenge.
