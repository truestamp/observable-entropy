      "text": "Hey HN! Loooong time lurker, first time poster here. I made this project and I&#x27;d love to hear what you think about it. There&#x27;s tons of info in the repo&#x27;s README, but here&#x27;s the short version:<p>Spoonfy, an FOSS project, is essentially the so-called Telenovela method (learning languages through subtitled video) on steroids. It presents translated subtitles in a clever way that turns them into something akin to X-Ray vision, helping you make sense of &amp; learn from the foreign-language audio you hear.<p>This video (also linked in the README) demonstrates the effect (Note: It&#x27;s Despacito so it&#x27;s slightly NSFW): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;12qYKv_yaqGr9GWvHPtE9ng2foJVPfpoE&#x2F;view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;12qYKv_yaqGr9GWvHPtE9ng2foJV...</a><p>I&#x27;m looking for help with the project (the demo isn&#x27;t exactly user-friendly right now) but I&#x27;ll also gladly accept any feedback. I feel this project has incredible potential: Due to its similarity to how we all learned our first language it could be the first step towards becoming a native --not native-like, but native-- speaker in a foreign language. What do you folks think?<p>Thanks for checking it out.",
