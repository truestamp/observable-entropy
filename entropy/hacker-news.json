      "text": "Hi HN!<p>I am asking for your guidance again.<p>The problem:\nIn Subsaharan Africa, maps are unreliable and&#x2F;or unavailable. \nExcluding city centers, there are no addresses, street names or the likes.<p>The context: \nI was shocked by the smartphone penetration. Everyone has at least one smartphone with GPS&#x2F;Camera and Whatsapp&#x2F;email  (Thanks India &amp; China). The 4g&#x2F;LTE service is reliable &amp; cheap.<p>The idea:\nWith a relatively young population and a low cost of living, I  can afford to pay people to crowdsource streets, homes, shops, etc...\nThus I am building an android app for that.\nTaking a picture of every door you see\nMapping roads with the user GPS\nAdding elements such as road condition&#x2F;infrastructure<p>The question:\nHow would you advise me to build such a service? \nShould I ask the user to open the app while he is moving, and taking pictures of every door he sees? Then add it to a map? \nHow can I generate an accurate map from hundreds of user travel histories and geo-tagged pictures?\nI&#x27;m gladly receiving every piece of advice<p>My knowledge:\nI owned mobility as a service Saas B2G company in rural Canada called Proxybus. I have worked with OSM (OpenStreetMaps), and I&#x27;m a fairly skilled full-stack developer.",
