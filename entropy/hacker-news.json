      "text": "This is quite a personal post. I just want to ask this community&#x27;s advice because I feel like my life is going in a downward spiral already.<p>First off, I&#x27;m not from the US or any country which has a major impact on global tech development. Most tech jobs here are either in big local companies or in outsourcing.<p>I&#x27;m currently in my senior year but has been struggling to finish my senior project for more than two years already (yes, I&#x27;ve been a senior for that long) because I&#x27;m too afraid to graduate and enter the tech field. I&#x27;m actually losing interest in my project as time goes by and my passion for most things tech-related has been dwindling. Trying to do anything about it just makes me think how much &quot;I hate this work.&quot;<p>Some of my peers in other fields actually say they envy me for choosing this degree because based on their perception, it could lead me to a job that could make me well-off. However, seeing how much work I need to do (i.e. through constant studying and learning) just to have a steady career, it&#x27;s making me question if I really made the right choice in terms of my education and possible career paths. Moreover, I&#x27;m starting to feel the pressure of the job market seeing how more people are entering this field because &quot;this is where the money is.&quot; Not to mention the job cuts I&#x27;ve been hearing about because of global recession.",
