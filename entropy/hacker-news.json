      "text": "Does anyone know of tools&#x2F;techniques for generating a coverage report of user documentation over source code?  In other words, I&#x27;d like to be able to automatically determine when there is documentation missing for an implemented feature or if there is documentation for a feature that was removed.<p>I&#x27;m asking because I&#x27;ve been working on a tool for many years and it&#x27;s grown large enough that I have a hard time keeping track of what all the parts do and what has and has not been documented.  What I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;d like to do is add a tag to a piece of source code (C++) and put the corresponding tag in the user docs (RST).  Then, during the build, I&#x27;d like a report of untagged code, code&#x2F;docs with matching tags, and code&#x2F;docs with unmatched tags.<p>I also feel like there should be at least two levels of documentation to be tracked: 1) the overall feature and 2) fine-details about how the feature behaves under different circumstances.  For example, a feature that interacted with the network would have an overall description and some extra notes about how timeouts&#x2F;retries are handled.<p>Does anyone have any experience with such a thing or have a similar interest?",
