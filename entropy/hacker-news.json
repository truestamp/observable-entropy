      "text": "I&#x27;m interested in hearing your experience and advice on how someone from outside the EU would go about finding an entry&#x2F;junior level job with visa&#x2F;relocation sponsorship in Europe. More specifically:<p>- How much of an investment is a visa sponsorship from the company&#x27;s standpoint? Is it something that is only really done for senior employees?<p>- Is there a specific subset of companies that are more likely to be open to relocation? In terms of company size, country, area of work, etc...<p>Any firsthand experience from a recruiter&#x27;s point of view would also be greatly appreciated.<p>A bit of background information about myself for those who would like to give more specific answers.\n- graduating with Associate&#x27;s in CE this spring\n- about 1yr work experience mostly in devops&#x2F;cloud and some in SE\n- interested in cloud&#x2F;infrastructure and maybe shifting towards development in this area in the future\n- from sanctioned country, Iran (so remote work isn&#x27;t possible in most cases)",
