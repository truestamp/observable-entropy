      "text": "We recently plugged in GPT-3 to our software which can record &#x2F; transcribe &#x2F; search and share meetings - and have been quite baffled by the quality of the meeting minutes outputted.<p>GPT-3 understands what a discussion revolves around - even if it&#x27;s only mentionned once - and summarizes it really efficiently. It lays out the different topics and always puts forward the next steps.<p>Linked is a quick example on one of my conversations with a company in the Philippines.<p>An amusing bug was that if for whatever reason no to little transcription was outputted, GPT-3 would insult the participants (is it trained on Reddit??).<p>The danger would be if GPT-3 misinterprets something and this then gets into the formal decision process of a company. However I haven&#x27;t seen it yet and for the moment have only been baffled by the results.<p>Check it out it&#x27;s free to try out:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spoke.app&#x2F;welcome\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spoke.app&#x2F;welcome</a>\n:)",
