      "text": "It&#x27;s 2022, torrent technology has been around for 15+ years.<p>So why is it still not trivial to host a file by torrent on a private network?<p>If I have a set of machines behind a firewall, it&#x27;s a huge pain to setup a qbittorrent instance and configure clients to use it.  Even once all that is setup, the retrieval process is nothing like &quot;wget magnet:&#x2F;&#x2F;...&quot;.<p>To be clear, projects like aria2 (C++) and webtorrent (nodejs) do exist, but try to use them for anything production-ish grade or in an automated fashion and you&#x27;ll find out they are slow to start the downloads and overall unreliable and flaky.<p>A true &quot;wget&quot; -style system for seeding and downloading from a private torrent swarm would be amazing for many use cases.  I&#x27;m envisioning something like a program that monitors a folder and any file that ends up in the folder gets auto-seeded to a set of private clients.<p>What do you think?",
