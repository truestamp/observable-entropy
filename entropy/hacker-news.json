      "text": "I have a friend in New York who took a year-long programming course and just started his programming career. But he&#x27;s struggling at his first job ... I gather he&#x27;s not picking things up as quick as his manager would like, he&#x27;s &quot;asking too many questions&quot;, and I think his manager has unrealistic expectations of him. I&#x27;m going to try to help him once a week virtually, but I was wondering if anyone knows what options are available in New York for this kind of programming-oriented mentoring? Or a &quot;next steps after bootcamp&quot; kind of program?",
