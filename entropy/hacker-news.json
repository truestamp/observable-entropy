      "text": "Clever people often get seduced by the expressive power of the language and start writing Haskell in Scala.<p>Well said in Effective Scala [1]: &quot;Above all, program in Scala. You are not writing Java, nor Haskell, nor Python; a Scala program is unlike one written in any of these. In order to use the language effectively, you must phrase your problems in its terms. There’s no use coercing a Java program into Scala, for it will be inferior in most ways to its original.&quot;<p>While pure FP code can be a good fit for some projects, it makes hiring much harder. IMO, it is never going to be key component of project&#x27;s success, but can be a significant contributor to its failure.<p>Good examples of what I consider idiomatic Scala are projects from Odersky, Haoyi and Twitter.<p>Most of closed-source projects I&#x27;ve seen are either Java or Haskell projects in disguise.<p>What is you experience with Scala projects in this regard? Did you choose idiomatic mix of FP and OOP or some other approach?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.github.io&#x2F;effectivescala&#x2F;",
