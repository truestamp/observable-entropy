      "text": "This is a throwaway-account because the business I run still has customers and clients.<p>I started a company about ten years ago focusing on a fairly niche wireless product. The business never took off; revenue has always been between between $100k and $900k per year. At this point, it&#x27;s basically a hobby that throws off some cash.<p>I&#x27;ve been applying to various business development and product manager positions for over a year, but have had zero replies. I&#x27;ve raised a couple million dollars, navigated arcane regulations, hired&#x2F;managed&#x2F;laid off staff, and built&#x2F;shipped a dozen different physical products (about 20,000 units in total). I&#x27;m assuming that the lack of interest from recruiters is due to me working for myself for too long. Of course, I could be wrong and my resume might just suck.<p>I guess it makes sense that hiring managers don&#x27;t want to deal with someone who has not been managed for a long time, but those types are also self-starters who produce results with very little oversight.<p>In any case, are there any companies (large or small) that explicitly favor hiring&#x2F;contracting former founders? I assume my opportunities are limited, because most of my expertise is in wireless product development, though business development is fairly agnostic.",
