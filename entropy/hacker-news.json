      "text": "Sorry for what may be a spurious post. And I&#x27;m not slagging on Google. They do lots of great software (YouTube&#x2F;Search&#x2F;Maps&#x2F;GCP), and I&#x27;m sure it must be super hard to maintain quality when you have <i>so</i> many products.<p>But the experience I had today was just ridiculous. I found myself thinking, &quot;This is the stupidest thing ever.&quot;<p>What happened was I went into the Contacts sub-app and clicked the &quot;Frequently contacted&quot; contacts and started purging. Only to discover that a second-and-a-half after I went through the multi-click saga in order to delete a single contact, it, low-and-behold, popped right back into the list. But, <i>heres the real &#x27;funny&#x27; thing</i>, it was in a different place! Wow. Literally whack-a-mole.<p>I was dumbfounded at the stupidity of this. Yet I&#x27;m not slagging on any dev responsible, as I could definitely see myself creating a bug like this, too. But, I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s there. Is Contacts really the dusty, spiderwebbed corner of the Internet where none ever return from (except the ones you delete, heh), and there be dragons? I mean, come on. It&#x27;s a list mutation. With server sync. At least keep the deleted action state on the client, and wait for the success&#x2F;error response from the server, instead of having it randomly pop back into the list.<p>I estimate it took my 1.618*normal number of clicks for me to banish all these infrequently (and now never to be again) contacted &#x27;contacts.<p>Bah!",
