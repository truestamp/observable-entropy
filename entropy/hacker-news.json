      "text": "Our homeowners association is looking for a simple group email solution. Does anyone have any thoughts?<p>Need to have: one email address that broadcasts to everyone signed up for the list. Basically an outlook d-list not tied to one email provider.<p>Nice to have: Some permissions management: Board members should be able to send emails without impedance from the system. Other members should be able to send group messages with approval from a board member.<p>We have some older folks in the community, so this has to be drop dead simple and reliable. I’m hesitant to suggest something like Discourse because of the unfamiliar UX. Same thing for FB Groups. Email is ubiquitous, so that’s where we have to start.",
