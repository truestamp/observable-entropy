Strategy and management of the creative team<p>- 2 years working as Customer Support drone in Big Boring Company with very little room to move and change departments<p>- 1 year or so helping out at university Venture Lab where we do workshops and Pitch simulations for entrepreneurs and students (about 50-50).<p>- I did 2-3 projects that never took off and one app that gave me some satisfaction (someone bought it) but never even broke even. In that case I acted as a Product Manager and had 1 developer doing the work for me.<p>- I did CS50 from Harvard online and a Python course with MIT both on EDx, but I am not able to apply for a programmer job (which I think I would enjoy and might be a way to eventually turn into a technical PM)<p>I&#x27;m playing around with selenym and chromedriver building a bot that swipes on tinder based on certain parameters,  but I don&#x27;t feel like I could be considered for a programming job.",
