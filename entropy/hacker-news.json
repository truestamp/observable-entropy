It is mostly cultural thing and people geographically close to each other share huge amount of genes. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;Is-Slavic-a-genetic-or-cultural-term-Are-Eastern-Western-and-South-Slavs-the-same-blood<p>If you want to target Russians, you will end up targeting some Ukrainians, some Belorussians, Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Poles and so on.<p>It is complete nonsense but this of course does not stop Russian propaganda machine to produce and spread it and it stops even less its gullible followers to swallow it, believe it and spread it even further.<p>To Make a Long Story Short: do not believe anything the Russian propaganda tries to make you believe.",
