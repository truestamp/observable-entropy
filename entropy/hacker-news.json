      "text": "In an unusual turn of events the Google Play app has stopped showing the permissions for apps and instead has replaced this very valuable source of information about the app behavior and capabilities with &quot;Data Safety&quot; which barely shows anything technical and instead gives some vague interpretation of what the app does with your data.<p>Earlier you could disable automatic updates and always know what new permissions a certain update brings - this is no longer possible or available.<p>This is especially upsetting in terms of installing new apps. What do they do? What do they use?<p>For instance I&#x27;ve never installed apps which require &quot;Find accounts on the device&quot; (android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS) because the permission allows an app to find all the accounts on my device (normally an email addresses, including your primary google account, but that can be anything including your phone number, unique IDs in various services) and do anything with them.",
