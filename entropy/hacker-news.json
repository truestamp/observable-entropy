I think this will be the fastest way to compute.<p>I interned at You Know Solutions and learned the flowchart programming environment they use. Now they have a new technology patented and I&#x27;m trying to help realize the potential. The flowchart programs are asynchronous by design and can create parallel computations. I&#x27;ve been trying to reproduce a flowchart program on a FPGA.<p>Does anyone use flowchart programming anymore? \nHas anyone used a FPGA to run parallel processes or asynchronously?",
