      "text": "This is coming from a place of ignorance. It&#x27;s not a challenge to the status quo because I think I&#x27;m smart. But a dictionary attack starts with a list of common passwords and applies them successively to the same username, correct? So why doesn&#x27;t the authentication framework just add a heavy cost to the IP address for each failed attack?<p>For example, add a 1 second penalty preventing the code from logging in on failure, then a 2 second penalty, a 4 second penalty, and so on? If it were me struggling to remember a password I&#x27;d barely notice, but if it were automated code running it would quickly become infeasible.<p>My only guess as to why this doesn&#x27;t work is that IP addresses are actually network addresses, which means that if everyone in my building is on Comcast then everyone would in the building would be prevented from logging in. But that doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense because ad tracking mechanisms are brilliant at fingerprinting individual machines, which means a authentication code could use a similar strategy, right?",

      "text": "Steve Jobs promoted the &quot;personal computer&quot; with this concept that a bicycle (and a road) makes a human more efficient than any other animal, even a condor. And that a computer could amplify your mind in a similar way.  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L40B08nWoMk<p>Today, I&#x27;d say wikipedia and knowledge in general is the biggest contributor (though, more internet than computer). The spreadsheet, in Jobs&#x27; time, was probably a pretty good example.<p>But I personally find that computers haven&#x27;t helped my mind at all. Mathematics is still hard. Formulating and articulating ideas is still hard.
