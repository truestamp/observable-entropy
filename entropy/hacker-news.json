      "text": "So I tend to be a cheapskate and I hate to buy stock content because I think I will just find it on my own or make it. But I recently came across Envato Elements (when I was looking for good font combinations for an ebook) and thought it would help me get some things I have to do at times done quickly, especially when I don&#x27;t care &#x27;creatively&#x27; about the output but just need a reasonable output.<p>Probably other people here don&#x27;t have my problems using stock content, and know good alternatives.<p>I want stuff where I can quickly find tweakable print templates, video &#x2F; audio, fonts etc. in one place so I can make a potential project presentation quickly.<p>What tools do you use to get the boring parts of &#x27;creative&#x27; work done quickly?",
