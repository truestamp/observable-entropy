      "text": "Some venues accept a photo of a negative DIY corona test result. But how to prevent abuse and how to make sure the test was actually recent instead of asking to do it at the front door and asking to wait for 15 minutes?<p>One option is to ask for a newspaper date with both the pre-test picture and the post-test picture. I wondered if there&#x27;s a way to make it more tamper proof without making it a server side webcam or phonecam snap and timestamp service which can theoretically also be tampered with by feeding older&#x2F;other pictures to he webcam.",
