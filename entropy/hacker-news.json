      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a developer for about 15 but I don&#x27;t have any maths education beyond 16 years old. So no calculas (I&#x27;m in the UK). I&#x27;ve always known that this was a limiting factor for me and greatly reduces what areas I can work in. \nI&#x27;m nearly 40 and I want to fix this. Is there a single book or maybe series of books that could work through that get me to at least doing basic calculus? \nMy basic algebra probably needs quite a bit of work first. Maybe there&#x27;s an online course I could do? Khan academy maybe?<p>Any thoughts or ideas would be really appreciated.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m also really scared of &quot;getting found out&quot;. It greatly adds to my feeling of imposter syndrome.<p>Also I really want something that I can&#x27;t just work through, a structured path so I can see my progress and not constantly feel like I should be studying some other area all the time.",
