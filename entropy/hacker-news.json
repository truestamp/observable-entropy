      "text": "We had been struggling to get back on our feet for a very long time. About a year ago we were defrauded by some con artists who claimed to be investors. We invested $20,000 in bitcoin, we were promised 100% profit only to find out later that we had been deceived. This affected our credit score badly as we weren&#x27;t able to pay for our loans. Our plans of getting a mortgage at the end of last year was truncated, we were angry and downcast. Imagine our delight when my friend Beatrice suggested ROOTKITS CREDIT SPECIALIST. They helped us recover our lost bitcoin, and also raised my credit score to 760 from the initial 566. We’ve been pre-approved. They also have a credible platform for investment. They can be reached via email on ROOTKITSCREDITSPECIALIST ON GMAIL DOT COM.",

      "text": "Over the last view months my experience with article publication through Elsevier has been horrible: the proof, after paper acceptance, used to be just 2 hrs of me reading carefully what they have in their system, now it&#x27;s months (!) of going back and forth, with Elsevier going out of its way to change equations, shuffle figures, etc. Submitted manuscripts are returned to the author after several weeks because certain required statements (data policy) are supposedly not there, when they absolutely are. I was never a fan, but have never had any issues like that before.<p>Anyone know what&#x27;s going on? Did they outsource some more over the last year? Are they in their final throes?",
