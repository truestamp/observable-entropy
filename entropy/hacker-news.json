      "text": "Background: I am a software developer who has been working in the industry for around 5 years with a BS in CS. While I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to have had good learning experiences and technical growth in my roles, I have been thinking about my career trajectory for the next 5-10 years.<p>I don&#x27;t think I want to climb the career ladder in the same dimension that I have been. Learning new things&#x2F;perspectives has been the most valuable part of every job I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;d like the freedom to pursue a deeper understanding of a subject for its own sake. For this reason, I have been considering the path of academia. But industry has its merits, and I don&#x27;t want to limit my options to a pure research&#x2F;teaching career. I understand that pursuing a PhD degree can be arduous and rigorous (not to mention time-consuming), so I want to make sure it&#x27;s the right decision for me.<p>(I&#x27;m asking mostly about doctoral degrees here, because I&#x27;ve heard from various sources that a MS is near useless for career growth in the industry, but may be useful as a stepping stone to a PhD&#x2F;path in academia. Other perspectives on the value of MS are also welcome.)<p>What kind of impact will a PhD have on a software career in industry? For those who have pursued academia and industry, what has been your experience?",
