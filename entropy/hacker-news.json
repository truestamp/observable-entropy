      "text": "In the past few weeks, I have been thinking about my social media usage and my decision-making. It&#x27;s somehow influenced my day-to-day decision by social media.<p>For example,<p>For the past few years, I want to work remotely. I realize now it was because of the influence of people I follow on Twitter. (Like DHH, levels.io, etc...)<p>In the past few weeks&#x2F;months, I have been buying some alt crypto that I did not really explore or learn their fundamentals. And I realize it&#x27;s because of people I follow on Twitter. (Note: I am here to show an example, not to blame them)<p>I can continue the example lists. Some of them are good and some of them are really bad. I feel like the people I follow are who am I.<p>I have been exploring this on the internet and most people suggest not to use social media or spend less time on social media. For some amount of time, it&#x27;s okay. But, later after a while, I get back to my normal social media usage and become addicted. Later it becomes normal. And the cycle keeps going on.<p>My question is, how do you break this cycle?",
