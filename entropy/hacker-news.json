      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed that some DevOps teams struggle with project-oriented concepts, and my theory is that these teams are made up of people whose experience has been in support and systems administration rather than software engineering.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to dismiss or insult the support&#x2F;sysadmin career path or experience, especially since I started out on that track! I&#x27;ve been lucky in that most of my career I&#x27;ve worked closely with developers, R&amp;D, and academia. That has given me exposure to project work concepts such as requirements, acceptance criteria, sprints, etc.<p>My progression from sysadmin to DevOps took place over more than a decade; how do I help people who haven&#x27;t had that gradual change embrace the more software development style mindset? One team I am working with is very focused on support tickets and interrupts, and I&#x27;d like to help that team switch to a more project-based mindset.<p>How do I help people whose background is in interrupt-driven work change to working in sprints with requirements, features, etc?<p>Or do you disagree with my fundamental assumption that people whose experience has been in support have a harder time moving to a project-based workflow?",
