      "text": "The internet&#x27;s sentiment is that anything that is written in one of the &quot;better language&quot; is inherently superior than anything that is written in  Python. The better languages are - Rust, C, C++, Lisp, Haskell and maybe Fortran, Zig, D, Nim.<p>I have seen this idea  constantly popup in most discussion relating to Python and mathematical programming. Numpy being written in C justifies itself to be above criticism of Python&#x27;s inefficiencies.<p>I sometimes am not sure if it is programming elitism or a valid argument.<p>If it is a valid argument, is Python should only be used as tool for proof of concept? And when there is enough traction the existing codebase should be rewritten to one of those better languages? Have you rewritten your codebase in this way and if so what was your thought process behind it?",
