      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>This is Pradeep Baskaran (29).<p>I&#x27;m looking for two co-founders to work with on a social 3D animation platform called Highavenue (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;highavenue.co&#x2F;).<p>- An Unreal&#x2F;Unity developer (Min 3 years experience; C#&#x2F;C++ developer with good knowledge in CG)\n- A Creative Art Director (Min 3years experience in storyboarding, creative 3D design, illustrations etc.)<p>Highavenue is a simple &amp; easy-to-use mobile app where any novice consumer can create &amp; share 3D animated scenes of length 15-30s within minutes.  Along with the app, we are also building a MOCAP suit that just costs around 120-150 USD.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;highavenue.co&#x2F;reels&#x2F;<p>A simple thesis behind working on this: \nAll forms of content like audio, songs, photos, videos, long-format writing, short-format writing, messaging etc., have been democratized and available as a social product except for 3D animations and VFX. One could argue, AR effects &amp; filters can be a great substitute but creators are unable to capture and produce immersive stories.<p>Text -&gt; MS word -&gt; Twitter, Substack, Medium\nPhotos -&gt; Photoshop -&gt; Instagram\nVideos -&gt; Premiere Pro -&gt; TikTok\nAudio -&gt; Clubhouse, breaker, etc.,\nSelf expression -&gt; Snapchat\n3D animation -&gt; Maya, blender, Unreal, Unity etc., -&gt; ???? (this is where Highavenue comes in).<p>Already have a small team of animators(3D generalists) &amp; a developer, and also an early alpha version of the product is built. I&#x27;m looking at high-quality cloud rendering, NFTs, and B2B immersive 3D ads as revenue models. If you are interested please write to pradeep@highavenue.co<p>About me: Semi-technical founder, 6+ years of professional experience, (think of me as Product Manager &amp; UI&#x2F;UX person). For the last 3 years, I&#x27;ve been running a tech studio for clients offering services in AR&#x2F;VR, 3D animations, full-stack web &amp; mobile dev, and in a few areas of AI&#x2F;ML. Whenever we had some time off we would build &amp; iterate Highavenue. The previous version of Highavenue was this (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26239429). And after talking to over 200+ users, we are pivoting to the above product&#x2F;idea. So basically, all the experiments have been done and I&#x27;m super confident of what we are building now.<p>Please note: \n- I don&#x27;t have the so-called &quot;Pedigree&quot; or &quot;the Ivy League&quot; tags (the MIT, Stanford or IITs etc.,); VCs have rejected me for that. My previous work experiences and my love for cartoons, anime, &amp; films have somehow brought me to this path. I absolutely love building this (kind of a perfect founder-product fit). \n- I&#x27;m not looking for an investment from you. (your expertise in the particular field matters).\n- We can talk about the equity once you get to know me and the vision.",
