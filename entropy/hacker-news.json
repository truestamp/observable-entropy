S3 standby&#x2F;sleep support required<p>2. low weight for luggability, 2.5lb maximum<p>3. survives table-to-floor falls<p>4. always-on-AC battery deaths unacceptible<p>5. survives being in a bag, accidental activation<p>6. Linux support for all hardware<p>7. trackpads on par with Apple, at least<p>8. keyboards with clear actuation, spill resistance and backlighting<p>9. kill switches or modular hardware for camera and mic<p>10. bright matte screens, with vertical space<p>11. memory and I&#x2F;O performance approaching Apple&#x27;s M1 SoC<p>12. HDMI, USB-A, 3.5mm, 10gbE, SD, USB-C periferals are what people own, support that<p>13. trackpoints are great for text-editing<p>14. quiet operation, no blinken-lights<p>15. prefer no webcam over shitty webcam, no BT&#x2F;WiFi over shitty BT&#x2F;WiFi<p>16. USB-C charging, Thunderbolt 4 both sides, GPU that can be turned on and off<p>This list is compiled from an Ask HN two days back https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28861949<p>And here are some laptops mentioned as OK in that thread:<p>0. MacBook Air M1 (newcomer), Framework (if you can get one)<p>1. Old school ThinkPads (some of them, like X220), X1 gen9 Carbon ThinkPads<p>2. MacBook Pros 2013-2015<p>3. Dell XPSs aimed at developers (some of those), HP Elitebook 840, Asus Zephyrus G14<p>4. MacBooks before touchstrip, Purism&#x2F;Librem 14<p>5. Chrome-books (some of those), Lenovo Yoga 7 PRO, ASUS Zenbook Flip<p>As for myself, I see Apple moving in a direction I don&#x27;t care for. Both the hardware and the software.<p>I&#x27;m not buying a laptop this year, again.<p>Please share your thoughts, and favourite laptops.",
