      "text": "I am an experienced Java engineer (5+ years). I know Java and JVM well enough to do my job that was usually around building microservices&#x2F;apis etc, I know theoretical stuff well enough to pass core java interviews for senior positions. However, I am applying for a position that requires a lot more than that, it&#x27;s to do with finance&#x2F;HFT and they will be asking questions around lower level java I assume. I don&#x27;t have a spec of what they might ask, I assume stuff around JMH, concurrency and JVM tuning, but maybe anyone know more and can point to the learning resources?",
