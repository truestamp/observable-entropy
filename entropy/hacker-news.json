      "text": "Hey friends! Just here to share my open-source Chrome extension that I made awhile ago to help me manage the massive number of tabs I would always have open, hopefully some of you also find it useful.<p>It has a few features that have helped me from having my tab garden grow too out-of-hand:<p><pre><code>  - Focusing any existing tabs instead of opening new ones (regardless of how the link is opened)\n  - Automatically moving tabs to a group called &quot; old tabs&quot; after I haven&#x27;t looked at them in awhile\n  - Mercilessly removing tabs that I haven&#x27;t looked at in even longer (if you&#x27;re a loose cannon you can just enable this)\n  - ...and some other features I made for others but never really use personally.\n</code></pre>\nFor those using Firefox, sorry, it uses some features of manifest v3 (tab grouping), so it isn&#x27;t currently available for you. I&#x27;m keeping an eye on it and will release something when I can.<p>You can find the source code here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tbrockman&#x2F;prune\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tbrockman&#x2F;prune</a><p>Contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are welcome! Hope you find it useful.",
