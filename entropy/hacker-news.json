They have their own &quot;x&quot; in the top-right corner, and a pause icon in the lower left corner.  They&#x27;re used for ads, and for some actual content as well.<p>I&#x27;ve started seeing some of these where the &quot;x&quot; and the pause control are a lie.  Clicking either one does not do what you expect.  Instead, it brings up a new tab.  Always (or maybe almost always?) these are ads, rather than ancillary content.<p>Is anyone else seeing these?  Any idea how to actually kill the video subwindow on the tab you&#x27;re viewing?<p>(I&#x27;m mostly seeing it on Yahoo.  Maybe I should just not go there?)",
