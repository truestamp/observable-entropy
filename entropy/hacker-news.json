      "text": "Dear HN,<p>looking for a product name with matching .com domain. In this community I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t need to report on how frustrating the endeavor.<p>There were many HN threads about naming products, domains availability etc, just to link a few I&#x27;ve found interesting:<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=3874872 (2012, Before naming your startup, read this),\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=10030863 (2015, Change Your Name by Paul Graham),\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19485609 (2019, Name it, and They Will Come).<p>But curious about your take on a specific (sub)problem I&#x27;ve encountered. I come up with a single word name (not a real English word) with .com available, but alternative spellings taken. Spellings of a word that doesn&#x27;t exist, mind you.<p>For example. My idea: reddit.com (khem). But both reddid.com and redit.com are taken. My thought process is to abandon such idea, if I can&#x27;t secure (obvious) misspellings (typically this means about 1-3 additional domains), which are bound to happen rather frequently when the name is not an actual word.<p>This eliminates many interesting options, though.<p>What would be your take on that? Is just ignoring such &quot;name neighbors&quot; a viable approach?  Especially curious as I&#x27;m not a native English speaker and I feel I may lack some of the intuitions here.<p>I know, I know - it doesn&#x27;t matter, last time you checked reddit.com was fine, build your product, don&#x27;t waste time on naming things that ultimately most likely will not need a name anyway, and if they do, the final name will not matter that much.<p>But in case you happen to have some other thoughts on that, I&#x27;m here, patiently waiting, as I&#x27;m trying to find my way out of this. :)",
