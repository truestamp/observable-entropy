      "text": "Last month the us-east-2 RDS region had a major outage which took our multi-AZ primary database cluster down for 4-5 hours. We spend the entire outage online with a support agent but basically had to just wait on their team restoring full service as there was no way to stand up a new cluster or transfer a snapshot out of the region due to the outage.<p>Even though the RDS SLA makes this severe outage a very small 10% credit we went through the motion and followed their instructions for requesting an SLA credit with documentation of our affected cluster. We&#x27;re now at 15 days since our request and they&#x27;ve come back twice in that time, the first requesting the information already included in the original request, and the second requesting that we attach a spreadsheet calculating what we think our SLA payout should be.<p>This process has left a pretty bad taste in our mouth regarding AWS service and their treatments of outages and SLAs. 5 years ago I would have said AWS was pretty good at this stuff and recommended them. I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone else has recent anecdotes either way. Is AWS slipping or becoming scummy in general or is this an isolated incident?",
