      "text": "Solo bootstrapper here, with a SaaS catering to brick &amp; mortar small&#x2F;medium businesses. Restaurants and bars, primarily.<p>I have a hunch that, because of our typical customer, direct mail marketing might work better than CPC ads (which we&#x27;ve used so far) for new customer acquisition.<p>I&#x27;d like to give it a try, but I don&#x27;t know where to start.<p>Problem 1: Where do I find postal mail lists of restaurant owners (business address)? I am guessing there are brokers for this stuff out there. Are there any that are higher quality than others?<p>Problem 2: Who do I contract to do the printing and mailing? Maybe 1+2 have the same solution&#x2F;vendor.<p>My basic goal is to mail a postcard (or possibly a modest piece of schwag) with a coupon&#x2F;incentive to try our product.<p>I&#x27;d love any related anecdata on experiences with offline marketing from smaller &#x2F; indie devs!",
