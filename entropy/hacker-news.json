I&#x27;m running my own postfix at my own domain, and gmail rejects it with &quot;550-5.7.1 likely unsolicited mail&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve searched it all, SPF&#x2F;DKIM&#x2F;DMARC recommendations from google (all work fine), the postmaster tools (are empty because I&#x27;m not sending lots of mail), spamhaus and friends do not have neither me nor my IP neighbours as spammers. (I&#x27;m not an open relay either).<p>There is a submission page at gmail where you would send a mail that is rejected, promising that your setup is good, and they say they would look at it in two weeks time. I&#x27;ve tried that several times and there&#x27;s neither response nor change in behavior from the gmail side in months.<p>If there&#x27;s something I missed, kindly tell, I&#x27;ll try that; but I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s nothing else to try, and if you know someone who knows someone, could there be done something about it possibly?<p>Thanks!",
