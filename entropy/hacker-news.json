      "text": "Helo  Here&#x27;s an app that we developed to easily save and load your workspace. \nApp is still in beta. - might have bugs. Would love some feedback and help.<p>Why we did it: Working from home is quite difficult. You have to open every morning the same apps. You have to resize them. Then at the end of the day, you close them. You have to open your fun space. \nWhy not switch between the space layouts easier?<p>Functionality:\n* Records Open apps and attempts to launch them in the same place when you launch it.  \n* Data for each Space is recorded in a folder - You can customise it.  \n* Maximum 12 Workspaces for now \n* Run scripts together with the Space. Example: - Starting a specific Spotify Playlist - Opening specific links via your choice - Changing the background. \n* New Update checker.  \n* Records Activity inside the Workspace ( for future dashboard - time tracking functionality)  \n* Secure: No data is transferred outside. Only you have access to the data.  \nFree download here. (link to website) Open source Git coming next week (We are doing some cleaning). If you like the app and wish to help us improve it<p>Ikuna QuickSwitcher - Should work on multiple screens.\nPlease share your comments on the app below or via the contact form<p>App link: www.brnsft.com&#x2F;quickswitcher",
