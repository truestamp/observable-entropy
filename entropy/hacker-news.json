It sends my voice to the cloud. This makes sense, but I don&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone.<p>Disclosure: I am in no way related to any company, project, product that has anything to do with text-to-speech or accessibility. I don&#x27;t even know anyone that works in a company related to this.\nIf I had any conflict of interest, I would disclose it. I stake my name (discoverable through profile) and reputation on this statement.\nI am just a paranoid system engineer wishing to speed up my mind output &gt; computer input. ;-)",
