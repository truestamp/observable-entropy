      "text": "Hello There,<p>This is my first entry. Let&#x27;s see how this works. Just wanted to tell everyone about my unique story...<p>My name is Joel. I am from Germany but I made my way to Silicon Valley 2 weeks ago to go all-in on my Vision and startup - Artroom.<p>This Monday I send 50 bouquets to my top 50 VC Firms across the entire Bay Area, including San Francisco.<p>Every firm received flowers and a card that read: There is a new German in town. (A few firms received hand written letters in addition)<p>I am trying to raise some awareness for this Story because I think it is pretty unique and cool. If you could share it with People I would really appreciate it.<p>Sincerely,\nJoel Kosi Wilhelm Sofoklis Ganschow",
