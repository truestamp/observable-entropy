      "text": "Got this email from Braintree today:<p>Subscription billing issue notice.<p>Originating from an issue on July 27, 2021, some recurring billing subscriptions that billed on August 27, 2021, may have been duplicated. For affected subscriptions, this means that customers will see a duplicate transaction on their payment method. You can identify these by doing a search for subscriptions that bill on these dates and checking them for duplicate billing events.<p>To remediate this issue on your behalf, we&#x27;ll proactively refund the duplicate transactions to ensure that your customers are made whole. Refunds will be issued by the end of the day on September 2, 2021, and your customers can expect to see those refunds within 2-5 business days depending on their bank. There&#x27;s no proactive action or next steps for you to take to remedy these duplicate transactions on your end to resolve this issue. If you have already issued refunds, we won&#x27;t issue an additional refund.<p>We recognize that this issue may cause relationship issues with your customers and we apologize for any difficulties it may cause. We&#x27;re working diligently to ensure that this issue does not happen again. We appreciate your understanding.<p>-The Braintree Team<p>There&#x27;s not a day that passes by, I don&#x27;t regret choosing Braintree over Stripe. Thank you Paypal for screwing up consistently over years.",
