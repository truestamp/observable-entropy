I&#x27;m a web dev so a web app would be easiest for me to build, but browsers are filled with distractions (e.g. other tabs, search bar, plugins).  My other option is to create an electron app, which leverages my web skills.  A desktop app allows me to control the entire app experience, but would require that I learn electron and how to distribute a desktop app.  Anyone have experience in this area or other options that may have worked well for them?",
