      "text": "Hey guys.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying hard to fit in, but it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>When AI-generated stuff gets upvoted, you have to reconsider the mechanism. I would argue that posts should be voted along a number-estimate of how the content should be ranked (pondered by the voter&#x27;s weight if needs be). That way, intricate content can pop out easily, even if only a few souls can grok it. Inversely, a powerful voter can push down wrong, illusive content. Don&#x27;t tell me it can be gamed, because it just can&#x27;t. Worse to worst, you authenticate more strictly.<p>That&#x27;s only one thing. (and which is going to be downvoted for no reason, of course)<p>I also wanted to argue about why you should just shut the fuck up. Everyone is grossly licking Steve Jobs&#x27;s nuts without a second thought about ethics. This is only one data entry. I&#x27;m very aware that he is dead. That&#x27;s just to point out that if you look closely, you can see all over the place that people are not being good people. They are being a bunch of neurotic bitches.<p>It does sound ironic, and that makes me laugh.<p>Am I going to be downvoted although my words are pumping good dynamism into the culture? Would you rather see another startup trying to invent you a need which you don&#x27;t have, because they&#x27;re too weak to break free from the wage-slavery? Excuse me but I&#x27;m on disability, because I&#x27;m schizophrenic you see, and so I&#x27;m free to do and say as I want.<p>If you would only shut the fuck up, then I would fight for your freedom.<p>What do you have to say?<p>I&#x27;ll be waiting, and answering tomorrow to any and everyone.",
