Instead of trying to get rid of all the bacteria, why not add more good bacteria already found in your mouth (just like the gut)? A seemingly simple concept, we couldn’t find any products in the market that worked with your oral ecosystem. So we built it.<p>We worked with microbiologists, formulators, scientists to create the best possible formula supported by science and backed by research to build a mouthwash using probiotics to help you achieve fresher breath and healthier gums.<p>Nontoxic and Vegan\n  Science-Backed &amp; Dentist Formulated\n  Plastic Free\n  Woman Founded \n Charitable Giving",
