      "text": "Morning y&#x27;all,<p>I&#x27;ve been a software engineer, with a partial-focus&#x2F;lean-towards the data engineering space since ~2014, and one of the problems I&#x27;ve seen in this space (and others), is that there just aren&#x27;t many available code (read: actual code, not diagrams), examples of complex (ish) problems that you can trust.<p>So, I wanted to gauge interest in two things:<p><pre><code>    Are any of you interested in a Complete Code Example: Change Data Capture from RDBMS to Data Warehouse\n\n    Are any of you interested in building&#x2F;selling access to a Complete Code Example: Change Data Capture from RDBMS to Data Warehouse\n\n</code></pre>\nA brief survey is linked below, and I&#x27;ll follow up with the results, because, depending on your use case (being a maker&#x2F;consumer of the CDC example), it&#x27;d be nice to know how many people want this example or can produce it.<p>SURVEY: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLScewADlsyO4-KfjAE-mgr_bqML1gVBn88rH7ifaEVUS-y5GSg&#x2F;viewform?usp=sf_link<p>I&#x27;ve personally implemented CDC and ingestion systems, and if you respond and post in this thread, I&#x27;ll give you a year of access to a complete implementation once it&#x27;s completed in the next few weeks via https:&#x2F;&#x2F;umkr.com&#x2F;<p>Thank you,<p>Mo",
