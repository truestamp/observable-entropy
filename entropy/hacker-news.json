      "text": "When I got into this industry 10 years ago, the world was a completely different place. Bootcamps weren&#x27;t a thing. Computer Science programs were still something just for the nerds. And the industry was almost entirely autodidacts like myself who grew up immersed in technology and did it for the joy of it. Fast forward, and now literally everyone and their uncle wants to be a software dev, and CS programs are churning out hundreds of thousands of graduates. The thought of competing against someone credentialled with 4-5 years experience vs. myself with 10 years and no credentials, seems hopeless. It almost seems like the path I took would be completely impossible today.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve came across a number of news articles about the lack of privacy&#x2F;security with the built-in car electronics systems lately. However, when I tried to find a solution, it seems like they either involve physically disconnecting some components (antenna, cellular chips) or buying a car from 10+ years ago without any of the newer features and with rather terrible fuel efficiency (compared to current ones, especially hybrids). Neither of these seem ideal, since disconnecting components isn&#x27;t a foolproof way to ensure the data is no longer being collected, and it could theoretically be uploaded all at once when you take the car to a shop for warranty repair.<p>Is there a way to minimize data exposure when driving? I don&#x27;t currently own a car, but I may want one at some point. Is there any hope left?<p>I&#x27;m not too worried about the data being collected by the government such as by speed cameras, even though it is certainly a problem too. I&#x27;m mainly focused on the data collected by the car or dealership companies, or 3rd party service providers, especially the location data.",
