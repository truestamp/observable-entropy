      "text": "I have a master&#x27;s degree in &quot;Interactive Multimedia&quot; and spent the first five years of my career as a UX Designer. In 2017, I switched to Front End Engineer and have been doing that since. I write React all day and feel like I&#x27;m pretty good at my job.<p>However, I was in a recent job interview and got asked about the time complexity of an algorithm and totally bombed it. I know of the concept generally, but absolutely don&#x27;t have a firm grasp of it. I also gave pretty mediocre answers to some OOP questions because that&#x27;s just not a concept I deal with much in my current role. And there are times when I feel like I need to improve my math skills. The last math course I took was Statistics in high school.<p>The bachelor&#x27;s degree I already have is in an unrelated field, and my master&#x27;s was very design-focused. I&#x27;m wondering if it makes sense to go back to school part time to get a CS bachelor&#x27;s to learn some of the basics that I essentially skipped before landing my first dev role. To be clear, I don&#x27;t really care whether an employer would like seeing this on my resume. I&#x27;d 100% be doing it for my personal benefit&#x2F;knowledge.<p>So, what do you think? Should I enroll in a bachelor&#x27;s CS program part time or are there other options I should explore?",
