They lightly touch on the rationale that led the researchers to a hypothesis that they ultimately [presumably secured funding for then] explored empirically.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought that this represents the tip of the ice burg - the many *funded* scientific hypotheses that don&#x27;t pan-out. To me, these efforts are equally important, and I&#x27;m sure the scientific community agrees. It&#x27;s similar to the efforts (funding&#x2F;time) invested in replicating claimed results.<p>Does anyone know how these &#x27;unsung heros&#x27; (to include both the researchers and benefactors) are showcased in science media? Is this done only through citation of the &#x27;popular&#x27; papers with successful results?<p>1.)
