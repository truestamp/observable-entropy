      "text": "A little background: I&#x27;m an electrical engineer, which is a field that doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of remote opportunities - all the remote opportunities are in software and I&#x27;d really like to be able to access more remote opportunities in the future.<p>However, post-school, I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m a really terrible learner without formal structure (school&#x2F;mentorship&#x2F;a job that forces you to learn).  I can&#x27;t keep up the motivation to get past a certain level. That level seems to be around where I know enough to build simple system, but would need an actual job to learn (or force me) to do things more professionally, polished, abstracted, and structured. I&#x27;ve done a lot of school (up to masters), so I don&#x27;t want to go back to school. What I&#x27;d really like is to just be thrown in over my head with solid patient mentorship. Is there some sort of site to connect with people to help them build things? I essentially want to trade my time + eagerness to learn (and learn how to do it professionally and correct) for some mentorship.<p>Willing to learn anything that has a lot of remote opportunities, but for some reason I am drawn to react + node js since it seems like a simple set of frameworks to learn to build a full &quot;thing&quot;.",
