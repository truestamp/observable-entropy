      "text": "What services and best practices would you advise for centrally managing multiple emails over multiple domains ? These would include a personal email domain and several business &#x2F; side project domains. Each domain would obviously need several adresses.<p>From what I’ve seen Gmail and Office 360 don’t seem quite suited to this scenario, since you tend to have to spread things out over several paid accounts.<p>Obviously, good deliverability would be a strong requirement as well as ease of use. Some interesting features to have might be the ability to merge or keep separate inboxes depending on their intended use and offer private inboxes to employees.<p>If anyone has any experience in doing this or any services to recommend, it would be much appreciated ! Thanks.",
