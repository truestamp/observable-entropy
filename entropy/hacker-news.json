I find it&#x27;s difficult to find the right mixture of:<p>a) A setting where it&#x27;s acceptable to strike up a conversation with a stranger<p>b) A place not already geared towards a different purpose (i.e. a bar for hookups)<p>c) Filled with -- for lack of a better phrase -- people who are uninteresting to talk to. By that I mean people who aren&#x27;t looking to chat, all conform to a very rote &#x2F; traditional lifestyle, or generally aren&#x27;t great conversationalists.",
