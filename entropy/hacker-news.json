      "text": "Education and employment has broken families and villages by taking kids away, both physically and culturally. Parents and kids no longer know what each other is thinking or doing. Education made you blind to existence of creatures such as family and community. It made you think birds of a feather flocking together is racism. It made your teachers to think it is ok for men to get pregnant. It made mothers to forget how to feed their babies. It made you to lose all wisdom and common sense gained by humanity over centuries.<p>Economic independence has stopped births and medical science has prolonged exits. And the world is filled with old and sick people. Almost everyone in the West are patients and there is hardly any youthful vibrance.<p>Science also gave us easier ways for mass destruction and easier ways to destroy the climate. Science gave us pesticides and GM foods instead of nutrition, non-stop work instead of free time, unnecessary knowledge about universe and light years.<p>Science taught us how to depend on tools and others for everything and called it progress. It made you think of your crutches as your strength. You feel happy that science has given you a wheelchair, but don&#x27;t realize science and progress has thrown you into that wheelchair.",
