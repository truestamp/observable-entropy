      "text": "Every time I install a browser (be it FF or Chrome), I install a set of extensions right off the bat. uBlock Origin is one of them. But I also install extensions that customize my experience on Google, and &quot;detoxify&quot; Google to some extent. For example, I use uBO to filter &quot;People Also Search For&quot; on search results, and I used to use another extension that would let me know when was the last time I visited links on the search page. I also use extensions so that Google doesn&#x27;t show me results from Medium&#x2F;Quora&#x2F;Pinterest.<p>I think all of this and more could be part of a &quot;sane&quot; search engine that would give the power to the user. I don&#x27;t use DDG because many of the extensions I mentioned above are not available for it, and also because I simply don&#x27;t trust them.<p>Given Mozilla&#x27;s mission and their success with reviving FF, I wonder if a search engine is on their to-do list in the future.",
