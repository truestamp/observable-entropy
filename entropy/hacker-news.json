      "text": "Disclaimer: not looking for a job as my father does not speak english, just want some opinions.<p>My father used to code in the 80&#x27;s, assembly, machine language, banking services. He stopped coding in the early 90&#x27;s and now for some years has been studying and deploying some flutter applications for fun.<p>He decided last year to return to the market, learned git, dart, state management even how to use figma to try some junior jobs, but he&#x27;s always failing in the last interview part, where the company has to choose between him and some fresh grads (most of the time the recruiters say that the age is a problem)<p>See, he is not really trying to get a senior job, he is just hoping to get a job in the area again.<p>Do you guys have some advice for an older dev starting now or returning after decades?",
