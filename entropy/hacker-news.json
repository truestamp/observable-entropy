      "text": "One of my biggest pet peeves&#x2F;downsides of video chat is that they (by necessity) mute all other lines when someone is talking, to prevent feedback. If everyone is wearing headphones rather than listening via speakerphone&#x2F;computer, it&#x27;s not longer necessary to do that.<p>When crosstalk is muted, it removes a huge interpersonal dynamic in natural conversation. If I can convince my team to use e.g. airpods for all video calls, I&#x27;d like to find a video service where we can talk over each other as well.<p>Do you know of any?",
