      "text": "While it&#x27;s not hard to write a Dockerfile, I think it&#x27;s hard to write a good one.<p>Every language has its own quirks, and every framework has a special way of building things.<p>I was looking for a collection of well-written and well-maintained Dockerfiles, but I couldn&#x27;t find one.<p>Thus, I thought of creating one!<p>I realized it&#x27;s not enough to have a simple Dockerfile. Sometimes you need other files for your build: nginx.conf, php.ini, my.cnf, etc.<p>I also realized that people have different preferences. In Node, some use NPM, some use YARN, some use PNPM. In PHP, some use Apache, some use FPM with Nginx.<p>So I build a set of &quot;builders&quot;, Dockerfile generators. You define a form using JSON Schema, and then define a function &quot;generate&quot; that returns an array of files.<p>In the future, I can make a CLI tool that will generate prompts, similar to how the form is generated on the web.<p>For now, I only implemented a builder for Next.js based on their official Dockerfile example.<p>Source-Code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;easypanel-io&#x2F;builders\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;easypanel-io&#x2F;builders</a><p>Playground: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;easypanel-builders.netlify.app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;easypanel-builders.netlify.app&#x2F;</a><p>---<p>1. Do you have any feedback for this project?<p>2. Can you link some good Dockerfiles that I should include?",

      "text": "a.k.a. why do we never get around to plan-to-watch&#x2F;plan-to-read lists, even though we care about them enough to meticulously earmark them for later?<p>When I encounter interesting things but can&#x27;t dive into them at that time, I try to list them down or organize them together so that I don&#x27;t forget about them and so that I can come back to them later. But regularly, the exact opposite happens - I never open these lists and they are not attractive to me at all.<p>Some recent examples:\n1. I had added many interesting articles to pocket, and meticulously tagged them by category. But I never opened Pocket since.<p>2. I note down hundred of exciting ideas on Notion. Yet I literally never feel like rereading any of them.<p>3. I&#x27;ve listed down the GOAT and the most-appealing-to-me pieces of media, among movies, anime, games, books etc. But I never feel like going back to these lists and picking something from them.<p>So can please someone tell me what&#x27;s going on here? Is it that this save-for-later behaviour is killing the excitement that a new thing brings? I&#x27;m puzzled why I don&#x27;t like picking up self-curated media. If I had encountered that thing by itself (i.e. not from a self-curated list) and started it at that moment, I think I would&#x27;ve enjoyed it enthusiastically. Yet my enthusiasm dies when I save that thing for later.<p>Do you experience this too? What could be going on here?",
