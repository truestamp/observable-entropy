      "text": "GM to all,<p>We&#x27;ve been working on an opensource NPM package and tool https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftoptions.app for creating options contracts on the Solana blockchain. The client is in nodejs https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;solana-options , with an onchain server written in Rust https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbanda&#x2F;solana-nft-options<p>This package allows you to easily create options contracts for tokens on Solana, with specific expiry times and strike values on the blockchain in one line of code. Similarly, you can use it to mint tokens and create contracts on those tokens. This allows you to do things like mint an NFT for a piece of art and then sell a call contract to buy that NFT at a predefined price. Each contract is tied to an NFT too, so you can easily trade them as well.<p>The onchain program is currently available on Solana devnet and testnet. We hope to launch on mainnet soon and possibly drop the NFTs on platforms such as Solsea for easy exchange. Currently, the web app https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftoptions.app only supports the Phantom wallet but we are looking to add more soon.<p>We are looking for feedback, contributors and testers. Issues can be filed on the GitHub. As always, any feedback is greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks y’all.",
