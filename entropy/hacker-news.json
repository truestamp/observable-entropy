This can&#x27;t be healthy.<p>I do go for long walks which is 1 hr and if I remove 6hrs of actual sleep , 3 more hour of other stuff like shower, washroom, cooking, cleaning etc. I would still have 14hr where I am just sitting.<p>When I was going to the office, I would spend way more time going for walks around the office building, run to grab coffee etc. I think it was much more energetic life style.<p>What do you guys do to solve this ?",
