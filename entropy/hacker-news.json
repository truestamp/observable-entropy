For example, it is possible for small companies to design their own typeface, white-label their brand of true wireless earbuds, or develop a basic chat application.<p>On the other hand, some are incredibly difficult to reproduce, due to network effect, lack of data, or R&amp;D costs. For example, designing your own chip, developing your own office productivity suite, obtaining movie streaming rights from all major film producers, or building a digital map of all the streets in the world, might only be achievable by a handful of tech giants. As such, these would be considered to be some of tech&#x27;s largest moats.<p>What are some of the largest moats in tech? Are there technologies out there that a company with 5 billion dollar and 5 years would struggle to replicate?",
