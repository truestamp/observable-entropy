      "text": "Hey folks. I wrote a book on applied cryptography during the last two years and published it a few months back. It’s brand new, it’s the first crypto book with a chapter on cryptocurrencies (if that’s your thing), and it packs all the types of cryptography I had to work on during my career. It’s made to be the most approachable book for people who want to know more about crypto basics, as well as designs used by large companies at scale, think end to end encryption with the signal protocol, SSL&#x2F;TLS, HSMs, and others. If you’re thinking “did we really need another cryptography book?” I wrote something for you a while back: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptologie.net&#x2F;article&#x2F;504&#x2F;why-im-writing-a-book-on-cryptography&#x2F;<p>That’s it! A good book to expense for christmas if you ask me! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Real-World-Cryptography-David-Wong&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1617296716",
