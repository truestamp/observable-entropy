Companies going remote and the boom in salaries reduced the pool of affordable candidates for us by a lot.<p>If you&#x27;re a bootstrapped startup, equity is not attractive and you&#x27;re limited on what salary you can give, you can&#x27;t compete with funded startups.<p>The only love we get is from lower tier candidates or those that want to work part time and we don&#x27;t have pleasant experiences with part time, productivity per hour is very low.<p>Are there any tips you can share? Maybe even on how to find better part time hires or at least motivate them better?",
