And one that is good at detecting any malware on a website.\nDoes anyone have any experience with VirusDie? They look to be good, my only concern is that they not be good at detecting all the different kinds of malware, and i was a little concerned that they are based in Russia, as client may not like that.\nI am after some 1st hand experience if any has any? Or a recommendation on another provider.",
