The link is about the possibility of adding  JSON specific command line options in curl. There are a lot of interesting comments and the submission quickly raised to the top HN rank. A few hours latter, the title of the submission has been changed and the submission is now below rank 50 or lower.<p>I&#x27;m ingeniously curious about it. It seems to me that this kind of submission stays longer in the HN high ranks. Does the HN also detects something about it?",

For example, it makes sense for me, with a broken App Store search, to pay $4 for each download when I can get users to pay $5&#x2F;month to use my app.<p>- Many other examples, with the whole industry going towards SaaS and HaaS<p>What has the world come to, where technology has been appropriated and we are left paying rents every month and companies are increasingly becoming user-hostile and predatory and monopolistic!",
