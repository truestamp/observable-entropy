      "text": "One of the main complaints against Solar Photovoltaic systems is the limited availability of sunlight due to time of day constraints or latitudinal constraints. Solid-state thermoelectric devices operating on the Seebeck effect only require a temperature gradient to produce a voltage.<p>If we combined a thermoelectric device with surfaces engineered for heat absorption (eg: a black coated surface) and passive radiative cooling (eg: ultra-white coated surface) would we be able to maintain a temperature gradient and break the time-of-day and latitudinal constraints of solar?<p>1. What are some of the challenges with this approach?\n2. What are some ways this could be improved to make it practical?<p>References:<p>Xiangyu Li et al., Full Daytime Sub-ambient Radiative Cooling in Commercial-like Paints with High Figure of Merit.
