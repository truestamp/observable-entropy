      "text": "In the first years of my career, I would talk to users, get to know their business domain and model it with them. I would find their problems, and then open up Balsamiq Mockups and put together something that would make their workday easier. If they liked it, I would have a cost&#x2F;benefit conversation with the person paying the bills or some other stakeholders. Then if I got the green light, my team and I would build it with .NET and JavaScript. I loved my job.<p>10 years later and I&#x27;m now a senior developer, but I feel like my career is evolving backwards. I am now working on a tiny sliver of a huge system. I know nothing about the user or their business domain because they are so far away from my work. I&#x27;m clueless about how my work fits into the business needs because those decisions are made by someone I&#x27;ve never met high up a command chain. I don&#x27;t get to find problems and creatively solve them. I don&#x27;t get to see the moving parts of user needs, business needs, frontend needs and backend needs, nor do I get to engineer solutions for all those needs to effectively fit together. I hate my job.<p>How do I make myself attractive for employers with smaller projects? I&#x27;ve heard the suggestion that I should look for startup jobs, but my early projects were all in big companies and I still got to do smaller self-contained projects.<p>Is the problem .NET? If I switched career track to .Node.js, would I attract the kind of projects I love?",
