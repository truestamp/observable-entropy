      "text": "I founded a company 9 months ago that is hitting $500k ARR and I&#x27;m seeing ways to accelerate growth if I have a cash injection. Aside from a pitch deck, I also want to find good-fit investors.<p>I&#x27;m finding that to be difficult. There seems to be disjointed websites containing seed VCs and angels like crunchbase and angelist but it feels like these websites are badly designed to quickly skim for the right types of investors. (Don&#x27;t get me wrong, as an angel myself I love the ease of use of angellist, but as a founder I find it hard to filter.)<p>Has someone created a community spreadsheet that they can share and we can contribute to?<p>Something similar to this one I found for Isreali investors: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1zuSO8fMBcju5S-ZfDh3ffajnn2U2eau40CbtBnp4ubA&#x2F;pubhtml#",
