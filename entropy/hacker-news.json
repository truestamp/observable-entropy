      "text": "I&#x27;m a longtime fan of PG&#x27;s ideas about startup hubs and the power of SF&#x2F;SV networks. Right now it seems like the consensus is shifting towards remote or virtual hubs.<p>I know this might be a redundant question, but between the cost of living, crime, and toxic work-cultures of SF&#x2F;SV I wonder if this is still a great place to go for people who love startups and tech. Are there any SF natives who can chime in and say whether or not SF&#x2F;SV as a &quot;hub&quot; is strong enough to withstand this downswing? I understand this question involves a lot of generalization but I&#x27;m just trying to get a feel for what people think rn",
