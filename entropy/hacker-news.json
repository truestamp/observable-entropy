Mostly, missteps in communication, mis-set expectations, etc.<p>I also feel like there are a bunch of other rules in play that I should know about, but do not have a good grasp on.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if there are any good books or other resources out there I can read about business communications in Japan, and how to improve how I communicate with my Japanese peers (aside from learning Japanese, which I&#x27;m pondering, but its a complex language, and seems daunting)?",
