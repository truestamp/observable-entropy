      "text": "A few month ago my roommates and I started building Rubbrband(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rubbrband.com). It&#x27;s a platform that helps you monitor and modify your users&#x27; Redux states, LocalStorage, and browser cache all from your browser.<p>Why did we start working on this?<p>We want to make the data layer on the client-side less siloed from developers. This is obviously hard because each client&#x27;s device is remote and is typically part of one-way communication.<p>Essentially we&#x27;re building the set of tools that we each wanted as developers building web apps that go into production. One of the main issues we found is that most frontend bugs we&#x27;ve found came from some sort of a data state issue, which got extremely frustrating when the code went into production since you&#x27;d have to talk to the customer, get on a call, etc... We wanted a simple way to monitor the user&#x27;s app, contextualize it in the grander scheme of the data models and application structure, and ideally push out an OTA update that would patch bugs.<p>What&#x27;s included<p>- A simple React library to monitor Redux, and LocalStorage states<p>- Monitoring user&#x27;s LocalStorage and Redux states in a clean dashboard, tied together with User data<p>- Client-side and Server-side API for serverless caching, with support for GoLang and Node.js<p>I&#x27;d love to get feedback on what you think<p>Mainly I&#x27;m interested in these questions:<p>- Does this solve a pain point that you face as a Frontend developer?<p>- What features would you want to see built out?<p>Thanks a ton!",
