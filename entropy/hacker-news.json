      "text": "This might seem like a weird request, but what’s the quickest way&#x2F;framework to create command-line&#x2F;terminal apps that uses REST APIs to reach and interact with arbitrary SaaS apps?<p>I’d like to try as an experiment to use some key apps via terminal (happy to host on a remote Linux server or MacOS and telnet in) to increase focus-time and go keyboard-only. I think for some apps (like email) there’s apps already, for others (like Slack) I’m sure someone has built something too, but for some (like Asana) I might need to create my own mini-Frontend for some key actions.<p>I’m ideally looking for some no-code&#x2F;low—code or rapid prototyping framework and not just a “hey just built it from scratch in Node&#x2F;python&#x2F;powershell&#x2F;php etc”<p>Hope it makes sense and thanks a lot in advance! :-)",
