It seems everywhere there&#x27;s an awareness&#x2F;emphasis on the privacy of your online presence from the prying eyes of advertisers&#x2F;authorities&#x2F;prospective employers, but little attention paid to the privacy of pseudonymous accounts from one&#x27;s real-world social circles.  For reasons that should be obvious, not least of which is mitigating career risk, a large number of people share a preference for bifurcating their online persona(s) from their actual lives, yet few options exist for doing so, even for services that position themselves as privacy-forward (e.g., Telegram, Discord).  Throwaway phone numbers are either caught and banned by spam filters, or present untenable security-risks to the account.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s much appetite for this to change among social-network founders either: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;nikitabier&#x2F;status&#x2F;1403498766737444865<p>&quot;<i>@nikitabier\nIf you’re building a social app and less than 70% of your users are granting access to contacts, your app is dead on arrival until that’s fixed.
