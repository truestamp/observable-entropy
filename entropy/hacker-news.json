Finding suitable users\n2. Scheduling back and forth\n3. Preparing for interview\n4. Conducting interview\n5. Analysing results<p>Now don&#x27;t get wrong, the insights were useful, but the amount of effort you put in, related to the insights you get out just don&#x27;t seem worth it.<p>Is this just me?
