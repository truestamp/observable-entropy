      "text": "Hello everyone! This is my first time writing here, and I want to introduce you to the project I&#x27;ve been working on for some time!<p>It&#x27;s called Conduit and it&#x27;s a new platform to build your next application on. I&#x27;ve been working with similar solutions since 2014, beginning with Parse (even after it was made open-source), moving to firebase and then mostly sticking to custom backends. On 2017 I founded a Software Development agency and quickly realised that if we were to improve quality and increase speeds we need a platform to help us do that.<p>Parse was kind of outdated for us at that point, and Firebase hasn&#x27;t (even after so many years) caught up to the flexibility the former provided. You can do MVPs yes, but you end up moving logic to the front-end or use the serverless functions that have many limitations and slow cold-start times. So for me and my dev team, it wasn&#x27;t a solution for anything further than authentication management and push notifications.<p>So, back in 2020 I begun working on Conduit, with 3 targets: Provide common functionality out of the box, do not limit devs and lastly it should work in the same philosophy a custom backend would. This meant effectively no runtime overheads (or at the very least only minor ones), a flexible API, micro-service based architecture with each service housing a particular set of features (ex. Authentication, Database, Email etc) and of course it uses gRPC for service-to-service communications so devs can create new modules from whatever language and&#x2F;or framework they want!<p>Fast-forward in 2022, we&#x27;ve already used in 5 production projects for clients. Our front-end teams love it, our backend teams have more free time than ever to work in more complex problems, and bugs in production have been reduced drastically. It even withstood a user surge in one project were we had more than 10.000 req&#x2F;min (we spun up more instances to account for the load).<p>I&#x27;d love to answer any and all questions you have about it! And I hope you like it enough to give us a star in GitHub :D<p>Links:\nwebsite: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getconduit.dev&#x2F; GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ConduitPlatform&#x2F;Conduit",
