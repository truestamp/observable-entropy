Misleading 100%. Not 1, not 2, but like 8&#x2F;10 videos are now garbage stock footage with bs commentary over nothing.<p>Example:<p>Nasa just discovered truth about solar system!?!?!?!<p>Science has progressed a lot in last 100 years....<p>So and so first discovered pluto in 1xxx<p>Mayans used to think balbala...<p>Some historians think....<p>Now scientist finally have answered....<p>New evidence (2014 research) shows there might be a planet ...<p>No explanation of study because you know it actually requires some comprehension...<p>Insert failed attempt at humor...<p>Leave a comment on your thoughts..<p>===========<p>Same script, like 8th grade essay you didn&#x27;t study for, but multiplied by 100x.<p>We knew it was gonna ruin youtube, people told youtube it was gonna ruin it, and now exactly that happened. Click baity videos with nice stock footage that is barely relevant and half assed &#x27;answers&#x27;.",
