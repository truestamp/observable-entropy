      "text": "I make $80&#x2F;hr as a contractor. Initially I asked for $100, but I was offered $80 and I accepted. We signed a 6-month contract in August which ends next week. I want to tell them that if they want to renew the contract, I want $90&#x2F;hr. Is this a &#x27;dick move&#x27;? If it is, what is an acceptable way to raise my rates with an existing client?<p>I should also note that we&#x27;re not in the middle of any big projects at the moment, so I&#x27;m not holding any previous work I&#x27;ve done hostage. All big projects have been completed &amp; delivered.",
