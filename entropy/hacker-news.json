      "text": "I am wondering if anyone knows of a parsing framework or existing tool that would help in evaluating pseudo-English-language statements that express models.<p>For example, it would let me write a tool to parse something like OPL[1], or maybe someone&#x27;s text describing a house, and get out a structural decomposition and graph of requirements from statements like these:<p>&quot;A full bathroom consists of a shower, tub, and sink. A bedroom consists of a bed and closet. A laundry room consists of a washer and dryer. The noise isolation between the washer and bed shall be high. The walking path between the closet and washer shall be less than 25ft.&quot;<p>This would have keywords like &quot;consists of&quot; and &quot;shall&quot;. Of course I could write a full-up validating parser manually using lex&#x2F;yacc, Perl 6 grammars[2], Parsec, etc. I am just looking for any more focused tools that could make this quicker.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Object_Process_Methodology#Basics<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oreilly.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;view&#x2F;perl-6-essentials&#x2F;0596004990&#x2F;ch04s06.html",
