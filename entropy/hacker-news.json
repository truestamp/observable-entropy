      "text": "I have a career in performance marketing. Building tracking platform tech, offers, and staring out mountains of data.  QR Codes have been around since 1994, but it took a global pandemic in 2020 to make it something grandma knows how to use (at least in the US).<p>As someone who is used to making decisions off numbers, I&#x27;m still baffled by the number of static QR Codes out there.  For an extra few milliseconds of load time, why not find out things like # of scans, location, browser and even try to capture data before they get to where you&#x27;re sending them anyway.  You can do this with restaurant menus, billboards, catalogs, office visits, you name it.  All missed opportunities!<p>We originally built https:&#x2F;&#x2F;autonix.io as a visitor management platform, but found out we went too deep on the problem.  A well built visitor management platform is a tracking platform that can also capture visitor data.  We made the visitor data piece optional and gave our full QR Code analytics suite away with all plans.  There are a few great competitors in the space but IMO its a huge space once we get people like designers and small business owners onboard with understanding they can actually learn from those little square&#x27;s they&#x27;re putting all over the world!",
