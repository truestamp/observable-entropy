      "text": "I understand religious and accidental reasons for children. But I cannot understand any other conscious, deliberate intention to have children. Why would you bring into existence a rational, thinking, feeling human when their suffering is guaranteed?<p>Most arguments - family name, have somebody to love, &quot;baby fever&quot; - strike me as extremely selfish. People want children because it will make them happy. If they really cared about their offspring, they wouldn&#x27;t have them at all because suffering is a fundamental part of life.<p>I&#x27;m assuming a perfectly &quot;normal&quot; family situation, without things like modern slavery. I&#x27;m also ignoring the chance of creating a child who is paralyzed or will face some other massive obstacle in life from birth.<p>A family can be made without creating more people, too. There are plenty of orphans. Of course, adoption is expensive but it makes more sense than creating another human, instead of giving that love to someone who has already been born.<p>It&#x27;s not that I hate children. I just love them too much. I&#x27;ve got twin baby cousins whom I love beyond measure. But whenever they fall sick, I remember that what my aunt has really done is forced them into a lifetime of suffering. They are surrounded by love and affection, but ultimately existence is pain.",
