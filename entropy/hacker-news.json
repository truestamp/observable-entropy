My current one is a no name company that pays 50-60th percentile. But, it’s not that stressful, I’m fast I would characterize it as pretty chill.<p>Amazon offer, would almost double my salary, and I don’t have to explain to anyone what Amazon does. \nSeems like a no brainer, but I have heard some pretty bad things about Amazon, their PIP program and so on, Blind is full of the stories.<p>So, is it worth moving from a relaxed position to something much more intense ? Will it pay in the long run having Amazon on my resume even if I get PIPed or leave after a year ? \nCurrently I’m “over performing” in my current position, and I’m getting raises and all the good stuff, but they would not be able to match FAANG on $ and brand anytime soon.<p>SDE1 position, just to be clear.",
