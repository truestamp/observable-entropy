I&#x27;ve been reading postings similar to my current job for several weeks and they all seem lower than what I&#x27;m currently at. Are companies listing salaries lower than they are willing to actually pay? Or am I just making an above market salary?<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear if anyone else is watching the salary ranges and to hear their opinions on them. Does anyone have stories of applying for jobs in Colorado and negotiating their salary above the posted range?",
