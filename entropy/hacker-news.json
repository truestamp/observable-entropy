      "text": "I know this may be a premature hope, but I sincerely wish Windows would eventually become a Unix-like already, just to make the consumer PC world more streamlined. WSL was a good step, and now I&#x27;m getting an Android-like Play-But-Amazon Store vibe.<p>So, does anyone have any hard facts about this rollover? I have so many questions:<p>- Are Windows services still going to be the elaborate mechanism they&#x27;ve always been, or is this going to merge into being like Linux as well?<p>- What about the folder tree structure? Will it still be Windows-like (ProgramFiles+Windows+Users) or the Linux style?<p>- Are we expecting any Win8 UX abominations where things aren&#x27;t where the users expect, or is this going to go like WinME-from-98 back in the day where it&#x27;s functionally similar but the insides are different?<p>- How backwards-compatible will this be? Can I still run x86 Win98-era stuff, or will this have to become another VM experience? For that matter, is there any baked-in VM-like capability now for Home edition yet (i.e., like Wine)?<p>- I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some questions, so please ask them as well.<p>EDIT: first post, forgot to parse bullets",
