      "text": "I currently live in the most expensive city of my country(because of the office location, WFM at the moment but soon we will come back).\nAcording to expatisan, living at my city has an average cost of 5500 Imaginary Coins per month.\nI currently make, after tax, 6500 Imaginary Coins.\nThis means that after paying all my bills, 1000 Imaginary Coins remains, meaning that after 30 years of this bullshit, if I save diligently, I&#x27;ll be finally able to buy a shithole to die in.<p>So my day is divided in 3. 8 hours I sleep, 8 hours I work. The last 8 hours I do all the stuff that enables me to sleep&#x2F;work on the other 16 hours(eg: run errands, do groceries, meal plan, cook, clean house, take care of dog, etc). This means I essentially work to live and live to work.\nIs this how things are supposed to be? Is there a better term to describe this kind of situation other than &quot;literal, actual slavery&quot;? What is a fair payment, in your opinion? How does thing work in your own country?<p>FYI: I&#x27;m 26, I&#x27;m a senior software engineer with 9 years of professional experience, contributing to a pretty large multinational company.",
