      "text": "I&#x27;m a technician at a large aerospace company. I work on systems with BOM costs in the 6 figures that sell for 7 figures. Despite this, our test equipment is horribly maintained. During testing, if we encounter a non-conformance, the immediate reaction from me or my co-workers is to suspect that it&#x27;s a test software or hardware issue.<p>Be it the cables used, the test software, the test hardware itself, or the unreleased customer software that&#x27;s loaded on the device to be tested, we have to rule out the equipment before we suspect that it&#x27;s something wrong with the product. I&#x27;m just wondering if it is common in large companies to neglect preventative maintenance. Thank you.",
