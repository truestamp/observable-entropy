It’s unworkable.<p>What about a feature whereby a presenter can submit a YouTube url to zoom and then each participant’s machine fetches and presents the YouTube stream locally?<p>My kid’s teacher keeps showing YouTube videos over zoom and the frame rate is like 1 frame per 2 seconds and it’s totally unworkable.",
