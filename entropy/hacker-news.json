      "text": "Title is pretty much it. I joined Oracle a few months ago after applying to a dev position. As soon I joined, I was assigned Operations work which to be honest is not what I was hoping for. I was wondering if anyone else in the HN community experienced something like this before? Is this common in bigger companies where it&#x27;s more &quot;Closing Jira Tickets&quot; than actual coding work? Is this gonna paint me as an Ops person from now on? \nI started seriously thinking about quitting and looking elsewhere.\nThanks in advance for any feedback.",
