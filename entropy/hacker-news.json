      "text": "Normally I am pretty ok in doing tests, but I was told this was a 3 hour test. I believe I am reasonably good at the technologies used. I believe it is probably a day or maybe two days.<p>Build a styled select drop down component in React, you are not allowed to use a component library.<p>Code should production ready. They will check both usability and technical aspects of solution. Include unit tests and keyboard navigation.<p>Of course should include readme instructing how to run and reasons for things etc.<p>The drop down is not going to just work with a select box but is going to have to be HTML mimicking select because the entries in the select all have styled fonts and different icons before each entry etc.<p>Up Down arrow on right end of select to show when select box Open Closed.<p>Left hand of entry in dropdown has icon, right entry has two lines of person being searched for - top line name bottom line job title.<p>on click event in search field, see full list of managers in dropdown, otherwise hidden.<p>two people are shown at a time, the rest can be scrolled to.<p>you should be able to search to filter and get people in this dropdown.<p>People are filtered on both first and last name.<p>filtering is case insensitive.<p>Filtering can happen across names so if you search for nras, bryan rasmussen should show up.<p>Bonus - when user clicks selection the dropdown closes and the name is in the select box.<p>Bonus - Selections navigable with up down keys.<p>On Blur: drop down closes but the last entered value is still in the search box.<p>on Focus: dropdown shown with available people matching the filter in the search field.<p>Data to populate field is in a json format that should be requested not hard coded in solution.<p>actually thinking about it again, and needing to be production ready, the search rules etc. probably 3 days.",
