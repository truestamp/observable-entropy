      "text": "I’ve long been in the mindest of gutting it out through the long emergency until things get better. But now that so many people are excited about remote work, it seems like back-to-back Zoom meetings all day will remain the central experience of “having a white-collar job” until I’m able to retire. The days I spend collaborating with remote workers leave me in pretty bad shape by the time the last call disconnects. I find I’m not able to relax and enjoy the evening, or to transition into being productive on anything else (work or personal). I just feel like shit.<p>It seems many people on HN actually love this kind of life. Do you feel similar effects? How do you manage them?",
