      "text": "Pre-history:<p>This is a long established business in the UK sports&#x2F;betting market, It&#x27;s got a known brand, a community of dedicated users, profitable, lean with enough money in the bank to cushion bad months or invest in further growth.<p>I&#x27;m one of the two partners&#x2F;shareholders, myself holding 33% as engineering director and the other the remaining 67%.<p>This other partner passed away quite suddenly in May 2020 after a cancer diagnosis, leaving the ship to myself, a family member inheriting his share, and onboarding an old friend with a finger on the pulse of this market, which would supposedly take care of the financial aspect and help us sell the business. Selling was always the goal.<p>Current history:<p>* Business expert friend that is supposed to find us a buyer is dragging their feet preparing a proposal and the necessary documents, profits are going down rapidly as no business deals have been closed since 2020, they&#x27;re mostly idling collecting their pay check.<p>* The family member holding 67% doesn&#x27;t know anything about the business, the market or how to run it. I am in excellent terms with them.<p>* I have been taking care of the day-to-day, tech side, staying on top of everybody while trying to keep the whole business afloat, and it is rapidly destroying my mental and physical health.<p>--<p>Since we&#x27;re not making any progress and just losing money, I now have to sell the business myself. I am a software engineer, I&#x27;m no business nor sales expert, I&#x27;m extremely stressed out trying to get ourselves out of this situation, and I have no idea where to go from here.<p>My only desire right now is to help our 5 employees land on their feet and take a long break from total burnout. What&#x27;s the best way of going about this? I am running out of time and energy.<p>I don&#x27;t have the expertise nor interest in growing the business further, and no idea how to find an interested party and good hands to carry the torch of what is a profitable and well placed business with no one at the helm. Do I need a business broker? Do I need to do the first step and contact competitors and prospective buyers myself?<p>Please, I am not interested in what we _SHOULD HAVE_ done better. I am interested in where to go from here.",
