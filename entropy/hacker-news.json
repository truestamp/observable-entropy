      "text": "We just released our Taskflow v3.3 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taskflow.github.io&#x2F;)! This release introduces a new task-parallel pipeline programming framework to help you implement pipeline algorithms. Our pipeline programming framework is very different from and is more efficient than existing ones that count on data abstractions to perform pipeline scheduling. Additionally, we have sanitized all potential data-race issues induced by incorrect memory order. Please check out the newest release. Thank you for all your contributions and support.",

So, for those of you that have hired or are hiring in the past few months, what is the one skill you wish more applicants had experience with, over all other skills that they could learn?<p>- Sample answers: C# operations, git rebase, resolving differences through compromise, understanding EDR&#x2F;XDR<p>- Please choose <i>one</i> skill; no ties, no top three, no shopping lists.<p>- I’d especially enjoy hearing from YC startups that posted hiring ads on HN this past year.",
