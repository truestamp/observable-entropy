      "text": "TLDR if you don&#x27;t want to stick around for my ramble: if you have experience inspecting JSON logs, what&#x27;s your workflow?<p>I&#x27;m working on a project of a very small scale where monitoring is important. I&#x27;m biased to just stick with text files and SSH rather than log software (such as ELK stack or Grafana Loki), so as to not have to learn&#x2F;install&#x2F;maintain a heavy tool for my toy needs. I&#x27;m also biased towards JSON as a format because I learned programming too late in life to be a Unixy regexy text wizard, though I admire people of that ilk from afar.<p>For improvised analysis, I&#x27;m using jq on the terminal. For less flexible human-readable text summaries, I wrote a Deno script. Ergonomically, jq on the terminal feels lacking. Whoever made jq is doing God&#x27;s work, to be clear, but I could possibly use a more intuitive language (with an emphasis on more tersely expressing groupings&#x2F;filters). And independently of using jq or not, the terminal is slow and ephemeral: I would love something sort of like the Acme text editor (where you can build yourself an interface on the fly with text), but without the three-button mouse dependency. Right now I just keep a cheatsheet of jq commands that have been useful. I&#x27;ve been daydreaming about making a local webapp to fulfill this need (that just eval()s Javascript, since it would only ever be local).",
