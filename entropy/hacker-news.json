I got as far as term sheets from large investment funds but never really made it to market. I realize this comes with a certain approach and personality, a certain way to manage my time, projects, what I aim for, how I behave, and so forth.<p>Now I would like to completely change my lifestyle of brinkmanship and taking nothing but moonshots, in order to prepare for being a father.
