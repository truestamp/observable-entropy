      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;m learning electronics and documenting my way as I go. I&#x27;m periodically creating YouTube videos where I try to explain in simple terms what I&#x27;ve created, learned and understood, to help others who are also at a beginner level like me.<p>Today I&#x27;ve created this video:<p>DIY dual power supply &amp; function generator! Explained!\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ybsgdeOz3js<p>In this video I am showing and explaining:\n- how to build a straight-forward dual power supply: For input it uses a simple supply, such as a single battery. It offers 3 output pins: HIGH, LOW and MIDPOINT (aka positive, negative and 0)\n- how to build a signal generator, using the ICL8038 chip + some external components for selecting frequency, duty cycle, etc.\n- how to amplify the signal and optionally apply an offset to it and then present it to the output as a &quot;usable&quot; low impedance signal.",
