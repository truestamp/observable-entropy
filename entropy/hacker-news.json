      "text": "I&#x27;ve been an avid enthusiast of everything living, and especially since Corona started. I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about how the entire ecosystem around the world is more or less shaped as a directed graph with animals eating food, be it other animals or greens, or anything. In addition they also produce all kinds of things like poo and urine which give live to other forms of live.<p>I think this is something that a lot of people had thought of as well, so I can only imagine something like this already exists, and probably in multiple forms and shapes as it&#x27;s nigh impossible to get entirely completely. Yet despite the presumption of such a graph existing, I cannot find it.<p>So I come here: Does anyone on Hacker News know of such a graph or ongoing effort? I&#x27;d be happy to contribute with my knowledge regarding visualizing graphs, mangling the data and creating insights.<p>Something that is somewhat related is the graph in onezoom.org that shows the (almost entire?) relatedness of all species on earth.",
