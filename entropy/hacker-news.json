(Eg., it is red if the photo accurately depicts its redness)<p>(3) ML systems must receive the same type and amount of visual information when learning and when inferring; and produce the same type of descriptions. Eg., an ML system cannot take a b&#x2F;w photo, if it has only seen color photos, and conclude a color accurately; even if the b&#x2F;w photo is accurate. Nor can it draw a color version.<p>4) Humans are able to receive visual information in a form they haven&#x27;t seen before (eg., a child sees a b&#x2F;w photo for the first time), which contains less information than what they have seen before (eg., no color), and produce accurate descriptions in many forms -- eg., paint, draw, spoken, ... -- (if the b&#x2F;w photo is accurate).<p>(4) is required for general intelligence, and (3 =&#x2F;= 4).<p>NB.<p>If the &quot;child&#x27;s first b&#x2F;w photo&quot; isnt convincing, consider a language case: we read entirely new sentences and still produce accurate facts based on our reading them. Eg., &quot;new york is loved by the gleebals of phefar prime aliens&quot; -&gt; &quot;Gleebals are a lot like tourists, they should visit Manhattan&quot;; A painting of the planet phefar-prime with a &quot;I &lt;3 NY&quot; logo on it.<p>You might say that an ensemble of ML systems with all possible types of measurement and types of description would &quot;perform as well&quot; as a human -- narrowly, here, this is the case.<p>The point is that humans do not need all possible &quot;versions&quot; of everything. If you have learnt to draw you can take entirely new drawings (with less info that you have had before) to entirely new sentences (with more info).<p>---<p>A semi-formal proof,<p>1) Agents receive an encoding (E) of measurements (X) of target objects (T), and relevant descriptions of those objects (DY).<p>2) They produce functions which takes an E&#x27;-encoding of a new measurement (E&#x27;(X&#x27;)) of an unknown target U, and produces, a description D&#x27;O about a possible target O. Accuracy: O is D&#x27;-similar to U iff E&#x27;(O) similar to E&#x27;(U).<p>3) ML Systems produce only one such function, h, where E=E&#x27;.<p>4) GI Agents (eg., Humans) produce a <i>set of functions</i>, g1..n, where E&#x27;=E <i>and</i> E&#x27; in C1..n (a big set of compressive encodings) <i>without</i> prior experience of eg., Cn(X&#x27;). And which produce multiple modes of description D=D&#x27; and D=M1..Mn without having prior Mn(Y&#x27;).<p>General intelligence requires (at least) generating g1..n from (EX,DY) and (2) fails.",
