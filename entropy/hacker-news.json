      "text": "As of right now, the way for any artist to succeed is to create a song → sign with a label to distribute the music → Success \nBut these labels have their own incentive to make money, so they take a significant cut of their profit. Is there a way without the middleman?<p>Yes, there is.\nWith decentralization, any artist can distribute their music and get paid a fair share too. Because unlike on centralized platforms like Spotify, instead of getting paid &quot;per-stream&quot;, there is a much better way.<p>By distributing the subscription revenue fairly among listened artists. For example, if a user pays 10$ per month and only listens to one artist, this artist receives the entire subscription revenue. This enables musicians to make 10x compared to Spotify.<p>And instead of relying on Major Labels to create more music, the musician can create their own &quot;Creator&quot;-Token. He can use the proceeds of his ICO to make better music or invest in better equipment.<p>The current state of the music industry is gatekept by big Labels and once you sign the contract a vicious cycle of events begins.\nWe believe that every artist should be able to stay independent, but Spotify doesn&#x27;t make it easy, because you cant upload music on Spotify.<p>Instead, only distributors can upload music on Spotify. Another middleman. And most distributors charge about USD 60$ per month to upload your music. This is a huge investment for small creators, and a decentralized alternative without hidden fees is needed.<p>This is where we come in. Demu.app is a decentralized alternative to other music streaming platforms. There are no hidden fees, and it is completely free to upload music on Demu. And it allows small creators to earn money from day one. Sign up for our Beta now → demu.app<p>What do you think?",
