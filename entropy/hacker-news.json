My grandparents for their entire life, they only bought things they needed, and nothing that they merely &quot;wanted&quot;.<p>I &quot;escaped&quot; the toxic environment where I grew up, and I loved with undiagnosed Severe Clinical Depression (and crippling Anxiety) practically my entire adult life.<p>Now that I am Depression-free and my Anxiety is under control, I see the world under a different lens. One things that I see is that my &quot;problems&quot;, present and past, are&#x2F;were mostly &quot;first world problems&quot;, and that gives me perspective.<p>At times I remember what my grandparents used to say to me when I was a teenager, and I can just imaging what they would say about today&#x27;s society&#x27;s &quot;problems&quot;.<p>My grandparents were a mixed of minimalism, Zen (they we devout Catholics). They were the embodiments of both &quot;Ora et Labora&quot; and &quot;Chop wood, carry water&quot;.<p>First world problems or first world privileges?  two sides of the same coin.",
