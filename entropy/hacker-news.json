      "text": "I&#x27;ve came across a number of news articles about the lack of privacy&#x2F;security with the built-in car electronics systems lately. However, when I tried to find a solution, it seems like they either involve physically disconnecting some components (antenna, cellular chips) or buying a car from 10+ years ago without any of the newer features and with rather terrible fuel efficiency (compared to current ones, especially hybrids). Neither of these seem ideal, since disconnecting components isn&#x27;t a foolproof way to ensure the data is no longer being collected, and it could theoretically be uploaded all at once when you take the car to a shop for warranty repair.<p>Is there a way to minimize data exposure when driving? I don&#x27;t currently own a car, but I may want one at some point. Is there any hope left?<p>I&#x27;m not too worried about the data being collected by the government such as by speed cameras, even though it is certainly a problem too. I&#x27;m mainly focused on the data collected by the car or dealership companies, or 3rd party service providers, especially the location data.",
