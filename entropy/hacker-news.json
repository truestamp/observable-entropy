      "text": "So I have just started on a new Software Engineering Job as a fresh grad. I had interned in the same company before. The company is quite notorious for it&#x27;s high pressure and fast environment. However I managed to pull through the internship quite okay.<p>But now starting as full-time has changed a few things. More things are at stack, my livelihood and work visa depended on the job. The worst thing that could have happened in the internship was just bad experience and no referral.<p>I am theorizing that no matter how well someone perform, the leader will keep pushing them to the limit. So I could either give 80%, have a balanced life, but always feel bad and pressurized because I am falling short constantly (but still performing OK to not be fired); or I could give 110%, sacrifice personal life, but might still feel pressurized (although probably less) by the team lead.<p>Changing company is not viable option for the short term (at least in the order of 6 months).<p>Would like to know how other people handle similar situation :)<p>*for cultural context, this is a south-east-asian based company.",
