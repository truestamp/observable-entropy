      "text": "I have a scenario - a shop runs hundreds and thousands of queries every hour. Each transaction has values like merchant id client id, purchase id, item name, item type, price, time of purchase, etc.<p>Potentially, the database can have millions of such records, and that can pretty much scale upto billions as well. The web front end will support queries like &quot;find the records of transactions by that customer id brought on this date within the price range this to that&quot;, etc. The response must be near real time, say not slower than what time Google typically takes to return a search result.<p>Keeping in mind cost, and most importantly, performance, which is preferable - Redis, or a NoSQL DB like MondoDB or Cassandra? Will Redis offer significantly more performance benefits because it is in-memory, or will the difference be negligible in this situation?",
