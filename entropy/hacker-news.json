      "text": "Hi HN! I’m Arnaud, founder of Echoes HQ (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;echoeshq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;echoeshq.com</a>). Echoes lets you connect engineering work to its intent directly from your product development tools, and uses this information to create activity reports that focus on the purpose of engineering work.<p>I&#x27;ve been an engineering manager for over a decade, and I know how hard it is to navigate the chaos of product development. Engineering management requires data — to inform decisions on priorities and hiring, and to communicate activity to our partners in other functions. But how software development insights are collected and used today is at odds with the developer’s experience. The data is typically gathered by enforcing heavyweight, one-size-fits-all processes, such as manual timesheets or mandatory tickets for every commit. Its use can easily turn into individual surveillance and misguided performance management. Indicators focused on efficiency of the development process alone perpetuate an outdated view of engineering as a &quot;feature factory&quot;. For all these reasons, we created Echoes. Echoes provides engineering organizations with the data they need to succeed, without compromising the developer experience.<p>Many existing solutions collect data from GitHub and issue trackers to produce insights, but Echoes differs in important ways:<p>* We care about the <i>purpose</i> of engineering efforts over the efficiency of the development process. Purpose is defined in Echoes a the set of outcomes your are pursuing as an organization (e.g., reducing the onboarding time for your users) and the initiatives aiming to influence these outcomes (e.g., a templating feature). Echoes publishes this configuration to your development tools of choice (e.g., as repository labels on GitHub, as a custom issue field in JIRA, or labels in Linear) and allows to tag day-to-day efforts with their intent, consistently throughout the organization. Echoes’ focus on purpose makes the reports understandable beyond engineering, and shifts the conversation away from engineering productivity to the collective prioritization choices.<p>* We strive to answer engineering managers needs without compromising on developer experience, in its broadest sense. We believe that builders should pick the tools and workflows which make them most productive and that management needs should accommodate for that, not the other way around. Echoes’ contract is that engineering efforts be tagged with their intent, but leaves tooling and workflow choices to each team. The resulting reports are team-centric and never about the individuals.<p>Check out our website (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;echoeshq.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;echoeshq.com</a>) and introductory video (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y2ochIr4obw#t=58s\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y2ochIr4obw#t=58s</a>) to learn more. We offer free trials (no credit card required) if you’d like to give it a try.<p>We look forward to hearing your feedback and answering your questions. Many thanks!",

      "text": "Just to be specific, I am asking about a good way to manage mail in the following situation:<p>I am using an open source email client and a mail hoster who and does the usual spam filtering in an excellent and privacy-friendly way.<p>For reading mail, I use my work computer, my laptop and my phone, the first two running claws-mail and the latter K9 Mail.<p>The issue I have is that I have some parties that I need to communicate with which do the following thing:<p>They are larger companies or associations (think in online shops, recruiting companies, professional organizations, organizators of recreational activities or sites such as LinkedIn or XING).<p>These can legitimately contact me for specific purposes (I gave consent to that, and gave them my email address), but what happens is that they then use my address to contact me for their own (non-consented) purposes, for their magazine, some event, some suggestion, an opportunity, something else, yet another thing, and so on.... The purpose is clear: They want to grab as much of my attention as possible in the hope that I might engage more with their offers or activities.<p>Blacklisting such addresses does not help in the long run, because senders and domains change all the time. Possibly, they have recognized that not all their messages are wanted and could become blocked, and they are now fast-switching sender domains to get around that. The messages and newsletters might have unsubscribe links, but as soon as I unsubscribe one, I have one or two new ones.<p>Traditional keyword-based spam filtering does not help either, because they use the same terms for their legitimate stuff and the things why I did initiate the subscription &#x2F; communication &#x2F; registration in the first place. This would not only block &#x2F;their&#x2F; site, but also mails from people that I am actually more interested in. Part of the problem is that I am actually interested in some of that stuff, but not in the actual deluge of messages.<p>What would help would be perhaps some form of whitelisting. But how to do that effectively?",
