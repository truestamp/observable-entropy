Even charges still (tho not long battery lol). We just had 3 machines break in the span of a week at work, and we only have 4 deployed macbooks. My friend just had their M1 display break. And my old macbook (like 3yo) just stopped working entirely.<p>Sure there is applecare - but apparently it will take 4wks for the part and 1wk for the repair??? what?",

      "text": "Hi everyone. I recently got hired at a big tech company as a senior engineer. I&#x27;m a &quot;new&quot; senior in the sense that I recently turned 27, so my years of experience is relatively small.<p>The language(s) and tooling are all new to me. I&#x27;ve been studying the code in-depth and asking questions, but want to be a valuable member of the team. What things would you recommend someone in my position to do?<p>I&#x27;m fairly quiet, so one of the bigger challenges has just been trying to socialize remotely and be an empathetic team member whilst balancing the technical difficulties of the work. Anyways, would love to hear your experiences.",
