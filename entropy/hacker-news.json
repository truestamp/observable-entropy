Usually pages from the same domains are top-ranked for other related searches too.<p>As a user I&#x27;d love to be able to tell my search engine to &quot;Never show me results from this domains&quot; (similar to blocking an account on Twitter) – but as far as I can tell there is no way to do this in either Google or DuckDuckGo search.<p>This seems like such low-hanging fruit to me that I&#x27;m wondering if other people have ever wanted this, and if there&#x27;s actually a reason not to do it.",
