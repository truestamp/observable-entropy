      "text": "These are a couple that came to mind. Do share your own measurements.<p>1. Tasks being done ( Checklists basically )\n2. Activity level ( How engaged you were - what was the APM etc )\n3. Amount of Breaks ( How many breaks you took, how often etc) \n4. Time Tracking ( Amount of time spent doing something. Deadlines )\n5. Retrospectives ( Once you finish a task you take some time to analyze and rate it)\n6. Efficiency ( Your performance compared to the average of previous similar&#x2F; same task&#x2F;s )\n7. Focus Time ( Pomodoro - how much time you can work on only one thing ) \n8. Amount of Distractions ( How many times have you shifted your focus to something else - interruptions )\n9. Number of ContextSwitches? ( Number of shifts between projects- tasks or distraction - work ) \n10. Energy spent ( Subjective. Rating the energy levels after each task )\nFull disclosure: I&#x27;m building a dashboard for productivity.  Would love to base it on real needs instead of just adding tasks and a timeline. Like everyone else. :)",
