      "text": "Hello HN, I need some advice here: bossman is not fun to work for.  Raises his voice in meetings, gets upset, and fails to listen to what I have to say. I’ll point out a problem with how we do things, and he says I’m complaining.  Also completely unreasonable with my time: mandatory meetings at 7am, and then 7pm. Sometimes with little warning.  Frequent calls after hours, on weekends, when I’m trying to enjoy time with my family.<p>Starting to get PTSD from it. Awhile back he threatened to fire me for things like being blocked by other things.<p>Last Friday night, I was part of a deal to migrate an AWS EMR cluster from Intel instances, to graviton. My end went fine. A pair of apps was having issues coming up. I was released as I was done. I made sure to let everyone know that they could call me and I’d come help.<p>The next afternoon, Saturday, I got a call from bossman.  I was in the middle of a home project that has been repeatedly delayed due to work things happening off hours. I didn’t answer, and was left a vm\nThat I can only describe as psychotic, where I was threatened with being fired due to the “failed migration” - no room for human error, didn’t follow SOPs, maximum punishment of firing, under investigation, but the co prides itself on being very fair (???).<p>At this point I had assumed the apps with issues were back up as I’d had no comms to say otherwise. None. Not an email,\nNot a slack msg, no one had called looking for help.  I was very concerned.<p>So, my question: at what point does this become actionable harassment?<p>My actions so far: fwd vm to HR (after having previously talked to them about the threats). Also sent vm to a director level dude outside of my chain of command, that went to his vp, and the CTO with this.<p>I’d add that we’ve lost at least 3 people since this guy took over, and morale absolutely sucks in my group right now.<p>And yes, I am TOTALLY, looking for a new gig. I thought I had something lined up, but the department was given enough headcount after fiscal year end and reqs had to be shuffled around and my position was tossed over board.<p>I intend to vote with my feet, but in the mean time I. We’d to protect myself and my fam.<p>Advice kindly requested.",
