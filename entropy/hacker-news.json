The coin told the story how the people from the village got their freedom from the centralised Kingdom, here in Spain in 1583.<p>With the coin I created, people could buy with it on the stores. Tourists bought it as a rememberance. Ended up making thousands.<p>People sent me photos from the coin around the world.<p>Now, I&#x27;m thinking in making NFTs collection of the photos from the coin around the world and a token with a total supply of the price they paid for their freedom (1.219.512)<p>Is it worthy?
