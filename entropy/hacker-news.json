Link here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gsmarena.com&#x2F;ios_14_found_to_keep_user_data_even_after_deleting_the_app-news-47676.php<p>I&#x27;ve tried to find any updates or responses from Apple, but the answer is nothing.<p>It is important to note that the Keychain here is not exactly the same as the iCloud Keychain, whether you enable iCloud Keychain or not, applications can still use it to track your installation behavior. In the era of iOS 15, where Apple places more emphasis on privacy, why are users helpless with such super cookies?",

Looking for recommendations of books, articles, frameworks, etc that can help me to prepare. It&#x27;s a product leadership role so I&#x27;ll have to come up with a 30-60-90+ day plan or something like that. I&#x27;m interested in materials that are specific to product or are more general leadership or management focused. Thanks for any suggestions.",
