      "text": "The past month I&#x27;ve been dealing with the joints in three of my fingers on one of my hands giving me pain when I bend them, and it kind of feels like maybe the edges of the bones are rubbing against each other (especially painful when I try to pinch or close things, like ziploc bags).<p>Actually first noticed when I was playing games with the fingers on WASD keys (for movement) and now I&#x27;ve switched to a controller, possibly for good, but now typing for extended periods when programming is bothering them.<p>I haven&#x27;t confirmed that it&#x27;s arthritis yet, maybe it&#x27;ll still get better on its own, but assuming it isn&#x27;t, is there a way I can continue to write code (and write comments on HN and whatnot :) and yet protect them and let them heal? Should I look into some ergonomic keyboards? Try typing one-handed for a while?<p>For those who definitely do have arthritis, how do you manage it as well as work?",

I&#x27;m the developer and the others are mostly non-technical.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing technical documentation with MKDocs which is great as a developer comfortable with Git and Markdown, but I now want to create a separate documentation set for client-facing, help&#x2F;guide material that the other team members can contribute to.<p>Currently we just manage a Google Drive of docs and PDFs and it&#x27;s disorganised and hard to manage.<p>What are other small teams using here? I&#x27;m looking for something that has some sort of editing interface, ideally can still track versioning of content, and is themeable to some extent.
