      "text": "A few years ago, my managers decided that developers should be on call for incidents. We didn&#x27;t have any sort of first responder or site reliability engineering staff, so almost all incidents, no matter how small, would be handled by developers.<p>Things improved a little bit after some time, but the idea of on-call developers is still very much ingrained in the incident management process.<p>Now, personally, I don&#x27;t quite understand why a developer would need to be woken up at midnight to diagnose something that cannot be patched by him or her alone.<p>Perhaps the issue is that our process is dysfunctional, but I&#x27;m wondering if it is necessary, or just common across the industry.",
