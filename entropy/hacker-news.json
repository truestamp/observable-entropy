      "text": "I&#x27;ve gotten myself into a leadership position at a non-profit helping to build out their tech (simple web app frontend+backend).  Since the organization has only a small amount of funding, they cannot yet afford to hire a full time developer.  Therefore I am hoping to move forward with the help of volunteers.  I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has ever managed volunteers, and if so do you have any tips?  In particular:<p>1. How did you find volunteers?<p>2. Did you do anything special to make it a more valuable experience for them?<p>3. Did you do anything to make do with the smaller amount of hours they could give?<p>4. What management software&#x2F;system did you use?<p>Any other insights or stories are much appreciated!",
