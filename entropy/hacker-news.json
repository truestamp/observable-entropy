      "text": "Like many HNers, I have an MBP with the dreaded butterfly keyboard. I will soon be upgrading and am trying to figure out what to do with it.<p>I’m guessing the resale market for these laptops is very buyer-friendly, both because of the infamous keyboard issues on the old MBPs and the amazing performance of the M1 MBPs. I can’t imagine who would buy a used MBP these days, and there must be a glut of them on the market as people upgrade to M1 models.<p>What are people doing with their old MBPs? Does it even make sense to sell them? Or are people repurposing them as media machines or something? My laptop still works, but it’s just terrible to type on and runs the fan all the time for no apparent reason.",
