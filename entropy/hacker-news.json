      "text": "Hello,<p>I developed a software that one of my customers uses a lot, we agree that I keep the source code for myself, but they have a legitimate concern: if I die then they will not be able to continue to use my software and therefore honor their orders.<p>We want to keep it simple and avoid any legal intervention to solve this.<p>I thought of a simple system, I put the password of github on a platform and, for example every month, I have to tell the platform that I am still alive by doing some action on it. \nIf during 2 months the platform doesn&#x27;t hear from me, then it sends the password to my client.<p>Do you know a way to execute this plan?",
