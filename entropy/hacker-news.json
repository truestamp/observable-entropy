      "text": "Couple months ago I purchased a Microtik Hex S router.  I configured it as a switch on my network. For some reason an iPhone 13 Pro can&#x27;t connect to the wireless network when this switch is plugged in, meaning it will not pick up an IP address.  An iphone 12 pro will be fine.  Once I remove the Microtik iphone 13 pro connects and gets the ip from the UDM Pro. It took me a while to figure out that it was the Microtic, however I&#x27;m trying to figure out the why.<p>map is as follow<p>Internet--&gt;UDM Pro-+-&gt;NetgearMesh MR60 -&gt;wireless devices<p><pre><code>                   |\n\n                   |\n                   +-&gt;Microtic-&gt;wired Devices</code></pre>\nAny idea what could be causing the conflict?",
