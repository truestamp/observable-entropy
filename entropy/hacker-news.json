In an attempt to raise the issue, I uploaded images with text explaining as much and requesting them to reopen the account without ID documents. (FWIW this would be the first time I supply any such documents to FB).<p>They just replied saying: <i>&quot;We can’t give you access to this account or help with your request until we receive an accepted form of ID that matches the information listed on the account. Learn more about the types of ID we accept in the Help Center:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;159096464162185&quot;</i><p>Supposedly the data is stored up to 1 year and may be shared with third-parties in the process. Not ideal.<p>Has anyone else in this situation been able to get around the need of providing them with photo ID?<p>(inb4 yes, good riddance and all, but would be nice to inform people of other channels before sunsetting)",
