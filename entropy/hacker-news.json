The easiness of tossing and reorganizing, I miss it badly while doing something like planning, backlog grooming.<p>While I understand that orgmode has some scalability problems and definitely cannot be used for big projects, even if we pretend that there are no problems adopting it for all project members.  I&#x27;m still curious about using it in small projects. Is there anybody who tried that? What do you think?",
