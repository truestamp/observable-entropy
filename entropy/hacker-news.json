      "text": "I believe in Mozilla&#x27;s mission of keeping the web open and trying to use Firefox as much as possible, but it&#x27;s hard... Especially on Android, where it misses some basic features like adjusting font size per site and clearing cookies and data per site. Plus the only advantage they had over mobile chrome, namely add-ons, they crippled into oblivion. It&#x27;s kind of funny, by trying to protect the avarage Joe from excessive battery drain they basically made Firefox for Android irrelevant. Advanced users have no more reasons to stay when they can just get Bromite, both a faster and feature richer (built-in ad blocking) FOSS browser, and normal users never even used Firefox because they don&#x27;t even change their wallpaper let alone their browser...<p>I really want Mozilla and Firefox to succed, but my hope keeps shrinking. What do you think?",
