      "text": "I went a couple time in early 2000&#x27;s and loved it. I started to sour on it when a massive amount of oil was lit on fire for an art installation a little later. Now it&#x27;s limping along in the pandemic, but the organizers still want to set large fires in times of climate crisis. I don&#x27;t care if they do carbon offsets, it&#x27;s still not a good look. The symbolism has changed. Why not do a light show? But no, they want to be &quot;buring&quot; man. I think the festival won&#x27;t be able to come back from the pandemic and the increasingly severe climate crisis. The participants will look more and more out of touch.",
