      "text": "I have an offer for a semi-tech role at a startup and they&#x27;re giving me solid equity. Like if it moderately works out I&#x27;ll get the price of a house.<p>What I&#x27;d rather do is code - either work on my own thing (who doesn&#x27;t I guess) or just be a SWE at a cool startup. To do that I&#x27;d like to take a year out of my current (semi-tech) role and do a MSc.<p>How do I balance these priorities? I don&#x27;t have a wife and kids yet.",
