      "text": "Musculoskeletal, Cardiovascular, Psychological and Visual problems are briefly discussed:\nBecause most individuals do not use ergonomic chairs, mouse pads and so on, back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome are common.Limited access to sun&#x2F;vitamin D, exacerbate this. Limited activity and high carb diet, often bring about degrees of glucose intolerance. While the use of tall&#x2F;standing desks may encourage activity, standing for long periods without walking (pumping the muscles and pumping blood in vessels)increases the long term incidence of varicose veins ( compression stockings would help). Limited activity, also leads to lower HDL ( good cholesterol) and obesity, further stressing the cardiovascular system. Limited real (as opposed to virtual) interactions in individuals who do not have “outside” connections leads to a sense of loneliness. Depression ( often presented as anger or lack of discipline, poor sleep and dietary habits) is more often under appreciated in the age of WFH and limited friendly inquiries.\nLong periods of staring at screen in short distance ( unless, if the screen is close to a window and one takes breaks looking at the distance)exacerbate near-sightedness.\nThe goal of this brief is to put light on the problems, though, some solutions are embedded.",
