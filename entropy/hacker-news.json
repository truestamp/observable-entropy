      "text": "I used Discord&#x27;s new account switcher feature and, shortly after, I was locked out of both accounts for phone number verification.<p>Specifically, each account requires a separate phone number, and I am not banned for a ToS violation.<p>After trying several different methods (including <i>buying a second cell phone plan</i>) I have been unable to access my accounts. Over a few weeks with support, I&#x27;ve spent money and several hours on my end, to no avail.<p>From our conversation, I understand this triggered a false positive on their &quot;suspicious activity detection system&quot;. They couldn&#x27;t tell me what triggered it, and I have not broken the ToS (no unofficial client), and they cannot remove the hold, and paying for Discord Nitro does not let you keep access.<p>This is especially painful because it&#x27;s cut me off from friends and certain developer communities. From what I see from posts on other social media, this is not an uncommon occurrence.<p>Has anyone else had these issues? If so, has anyone had luck getting this resolved?",
