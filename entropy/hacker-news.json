However, over the last couple of years, I noticed GitHub has been investing in their project management features.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some open source projects leverage GitHub Issues (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;aws-cdk&#x2F;issues and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vercel&#x2F;next.js&#x2F;issues), but it just looks really unorganized compared to Jira (possible bias because I&#x27;m new to GitHub Issues).<p>Looking to get some thoughts on GitHub vs Jira for project management. We&#x27;re a startup looking specifically at the following features: bug reporting, sprint&#x2F;epic management, release management (from development, to code review, to QE verification, to release), and integration with non-engineering teams (ie, letting customer support&#x2F;customer success tag issues that customers have brought up).",
