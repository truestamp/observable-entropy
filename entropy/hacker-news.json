      "text": "Hi HN - I signed up for a SaaS yesterday &amp; tried severally but I couldn&#x27;t receive a verification email at my official G Suite address. I figured it was from their end but today, a contact messaged me on LinkedIn claiming she can&#x27;t send emails to the same work email.<p>I&#x27;ve checked spam and I can&#x27;t find anything and it&#x27;s not like I connected my Gmail account to a malicious third-party lately. Finally, I emailed my Gsuite address from a personal email and sure enough, I didn&#x27;t get it!<p>I&#x27;ve checked out Google support articles and it doesn&#x27;t seem like I&#x27;ve broken anything lately. I&#x27;ve grown to kind of trust [the quality of service] large tech companies [provide] and if it was someone else, I&#x27;d have asked them to make sure they didn&#x27;t break anything but, not any longer. Has anyone else faced this? Can you help with fixing it?<p>Thanks in advance HN.",
