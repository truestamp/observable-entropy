      "text": "Hello everyone,<p>Vikas &amp; Magus here. We are building Fusion (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fusionhq.co), an open-source all-in-one user analytics and engagement platform somewhat similar to CleverTap &amp; Sprig (UserLeap).<p>It is built upon a simplified low-code mixpanel-like analytics engine with built-in live-chat, push-notification and email&#x2F;micro-surveys.<p>Fusion shows how your users interact with your web based products eg: page-views, button clicks, form submissions etc. But apart from this, Fusion lets you engage with a specific user or group of users who have something in common or perform a particular action, in real-time with live-chat, in-app push notification, email&#x2F;micro-surveys or set it up to trigger automatically.<p>Story :\nAfter getting rejected in Y Combinator-W21 interview and listening to the feedback we scrapped our previous project and started to work on a simplified open-source alternative to mixpanel&#x2F;amplitude for startups as these platforms were a bit bloated and we could only find session based simplified analytics alternatives like plausible &amp; simple analytics.<p>We quickly realised that our early customers who were also startups did not want to use another SAAS platform because they were already dealing with things like intercom, mailchimp, google-analytics etc. These tools have too many features as they are separate stand-alone platforms and small teams end up spending a lot of time and money. On the other hand integration between all these platforms is crappy and third party customer data platforms like segments are expensive and overkill. We personally use &amp; love crisp.chat not just because of how simple it is but also how it focuses on important features only and still gives an unified experience.\nInspired by all these, we decided to build a lightweight all-in-one solution helping startups understand, engage, convert and retain users from a single app.<p>Advantages&#x2F;Features:\nEvent-driven: captures user interaction like button clicks, form submission etc, not just page visits.\nCustom visualizations: Unlike google analytics you choose&#x2F;customize your graphs on your custom dashboard. Graph type (line, bar, pie, table, count), timescale(minute, hourly, daily, weekly), dashboard name etc.\nOpen-source: protect your user data, forget huge SAAS bills and self-host on any infrastructure.\nNo-code autocapture: after adding tracking snippets to your website fusion automatically captures what your users are doing (eg: login clicked, pricing page-view, profile form filled) without adding extra code.\nReal-time engagement suite: no need to depend on 5 different SAAS apps with complex integration or expensive third party CDPs like segments. coming soon:- Live-chat, in-app&#x2F;sms push notification, email&#x2F;micro-surveys.<p>Our vision is to build a lightweight all-in-one user analytics &amp; engagement suite for startups<p>We are featured on ProductHunt : feel free to visit our PH page here - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;fusion-4<p>Check out our Github repository at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fusion-hq&#x2F;fusion or request for free beta access at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusionhq.co<p>We will continue to work with the community to build Fusion. We would love to hear your experiences, criticism, thoughts and ideas!<p>Thanks for your time,\nCheers",
