      "text": "Hello,<p>As a technical leader and contractor, I succeeded to achieve some strategic projects for our client.\nNaively, maybe I idealised too much the client&#x27;s structure, I joined that client as a permanent Software Engineer.\nNow I have a better salary and some nice perks.<p>I feel like I regret for many reasons : \n- First, on top of the technical part, I have to do some paperwork and have too many meetings \n- Due to my responsibilities, I have to fix technical issues even when the contractors I work with cannot do it.\n- I became grumpy mainly because of the contractors I work with : I&#x27;m not blaming them for not being efficient their jobs but, because we struggle to hire people due to the lack of talents in the area many of them can easily switch to another mission. So they don&#x27;t care as much as I do.<p>Anyway, because of those reasons, I&#x27;m thinking about switching back to my contractor position or to go for a freelance career and working for the same client.<p>Question : Did anybody regret going from a contractor to a permanent worker ? Is switching back to the same client an easy step and common ?",
