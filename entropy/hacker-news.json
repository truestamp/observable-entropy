      "text": "After reading quite a few books and blog posts on event-driven architectures and comparing the suggested patterns with what I&#x27;ve seen myself in action, I keep wondering:<p>Is there any company out there that has fully embraced this type of architecture when it comes to microservice communication, handling breaking schema changes or failures in an elegant way, and keeping engineers and other data consumers happy enough?<p>Every event-driven architectural pattern I&#x27;ve read about can quite easily fall apart and I have yet to find satisfying answers on what to do when things go south. As a trivial example, everybody talks about dead-letter queues but nobody really explains how to handle messages that end up in one.<p>Is there any non-sales community of professionals discussing this topic?<p>Any help would be much appreciated.",
