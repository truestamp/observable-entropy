      "text": "Hi, I want to present my latest product: Numbra<p>When working in my previous companies filling work reports was always tedious and time consuming job. Everyone would push it till the end of the month and forget about it until accounting would complain...<p>I ended up automating this task via a script and now I have made it into a full-fledged product. Numbra allows you to connect your day-to-day services and automatically import your work to create a ready-to-go report.<p>Currently in beta phase, integrations are just with github and google calendar, but as the product matures I plan to support a lot more services.<p>Some of the features:<p><pre><code>    Import commit information from daily github commits\n    Import meetings and events from google calendar\n    Easy to use editor\n    Export to PDF\n    Export to CSV\n    Daily reminder via email\n    Auto-generated daily report\n</code></pre>\nPlease do check it out and sign in:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numbra.io<p>Since this is an MVP and I&#x27;m just validating the idea the product is completely free.<p>Cheers!",
