I had a week off and used a splint and feel better but I&#x27;m just in my 2nd day back and I&#x27;m already feeling soreness and mild pain.<p>I have a splint and bought a hot&#x2F;cold gel pad, cold especially helps.<p>I also switched my mouse to left handed use, it does strain my left hand a bit probably for not being used to doing it.<p>But typing is a big problem and I&#x27;m worried about coding, I&#x27;m having stuff piling up and I need to get it done but I don&#x27;t know if I need to rest more or what.<p>How did you recover from this, any tips &#x2F; meds &#x2F; using voice activation for writing?",
