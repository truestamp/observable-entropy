You can detect cheers, applause, filler words, edit transcript to edit audio, create audiograms and export in different formats.<p>We also have a chrome extension that transcribes any audio&#x2F;video on the page you are on. After transcription you can follow along with the audio and read the transcribed text while the audio is playing. You can search for spoken content in a podcast or other audio&#x2F;video content in your browser.<p>There are some limitations, our product only works on Chrome and Firefox, audio longer than an hour is not guaranteed to be transcribed (we will lift this limitation soon)<p>links: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revoldiv.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;revoldiv.com</a>\nchrome extension: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;revoldiv&#x2F;cjjljbmeindbfhkgomcnnmfmjodjeche?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;revoldiv&#x2F;cjjljbmei...</a>",

My main impression of it is that after a long period of talking about compliance at every standup, at the end, almost nothing is observably different, yet now the product is SOC2 certified.<p>What even is this certification about? Does it provide any actual security, or is it just a scheme to make money for auditors? Would be interested to hear HN&#x27;s take on it.",
