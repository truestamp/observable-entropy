      "text": "Many devices we own (ex: my partners breast pumps) consume a lot of power and take a long time to recharge their internal batteries to operational levels. If we ever forget to charge them or the charger didn’t work, etc, we’re unable to use them until while plugged in and have to wait until the batteries are sufficiently charged. But I can use my iPhone when it is on 1% no problem. Why isn’t every battery-powered device able to be used in a similar manner?",
