      "text": "I recently received an offer from a well known tech firm after multiple interviews with the team I will be joining. A senior developer in the interview was rude and abrasive leaving me with an icky feeling . I sensed that he viewed me as a threat to his seniority and influence and being a jerk. I do not want to work with someone like that and will be turning down the offer . Should I tell the hiring manager my reason ? I feel that he is not aware of some cliques and jerks in the team.",
