      "text": "Since the start of covid, I have been working remotely (as most) and I&#x27;d like to set myself up to organically find a cofounder soon. I don&#x27;t have many close tech friends. Do you have any recommendations?<p>I thought the best way to do this would be to apply for a graduate CS program and go back to school, make some friends.<p>&quot;Wait.. you&#x27;re applying to grad school just to make friends to meet a potential cofounder? Why not just keep working in industry and make friends through that?&quot;<p>Yes. Since I graduated from school and went straight to remote work (which most definitely is impossible to establish new genuine friendships with people through) I have no idea if staying in the working world is a genuine way to make friends and potential cofounders.<p>And What about the cofounder matching services? Is there any that you have tried that have worked out for you? Im very skeptical of these but open to hearing stories.<p>Thanks!",
