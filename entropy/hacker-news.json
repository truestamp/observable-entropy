      "text": "If you were me, and trying to start up a software test engineering consultancy that helps companies get their software quality back on track (everything from helping build test strategies through to concrete automation frameworks and CI&#x2F;CD pipelines), how would you go about finding clients?<p>I&#x27;m struggling to find anything beyond augmenting teams as a senior contractor but I&#x27;d like to take it a step further and find multi-person contracts as an agency instead. It&#x27;s relatively easy to find these projects for product development but quality is far harder (it seems). Has anyone had a go at this before?",
