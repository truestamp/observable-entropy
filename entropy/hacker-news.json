My gut feeling is something like Python might make the most sense, but wanted to ask the room.<p>Criteria I’m working on are:<p>1) Ease to get to “Hello World”.<p>2) Kid-friendly, easily available learning resources.<p>3) Low setup complexity.<p>It’s been so long since I’ve been there (VB6!) that it’s harder to know in 2022 what the right advice to give is for someone just starting out.<p>I also thought about steering them to HTML first, but I don’t think the open web as the same excitement factor for someone starting out in 2022 that it did for me back in the day (which is a shame).<p>What do you folks think?",
