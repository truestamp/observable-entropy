Had a bit of a gap in text-based mediums between AIM and joining Reddit in 2010. Still engaged vocally in private servers in video games like Counter-Strike during that time.  Sometimes that leaked into Ventrilo. Actually made some legitimate online friends that i engaged with for at least a few years with that.  The popularity of ranked matchmaking eventually killed casual conversation in that medium for me, though.  Stayed on Reddit for a long time, still follow some specific subs.  Started on HN about maybe a year ago<p>Tried discord here and there but it doesnt seem to stick to me<p>I was on MySpace &amp; Facebook early but didnt really engage with strangers there, just IRL friends and such.",
