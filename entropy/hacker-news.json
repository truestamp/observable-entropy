      "text": "Fedora 35 and bluetooth headphones.  Bliss!  However I run a relatively rare multi-seat setup.  The bluetooth dongle is plugged into a USB hub that belongs to &quot;seat1&quot;.  However if a paired bluetooth headphone is turned on, it is (usually) added to the audio device list for &quot;seat2&quot; and not available to the others.<p>Something is not multi-seat aware; I assume all three sessions jump on the newly added device and who gets it is a race condition.<p>Does anyone know how a workaround for this, or can walk me through how all this works, or point to documentation that does, so I can come up with my own workaround?  It merely necessary to force newly added bluetooth audio devices to seat1; the other two stations don&#x27;t need them.",
