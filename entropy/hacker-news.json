      "text": "I live in Mid-West USA. It&#x27;s been hitting 95°F the past few days. I experimented with trying to go without air-conditioning. Couldn&#x27;t do it. Couldn&#x27;t work on my computer despite being indoors and having a fan on my desk. Had terrible sleep (despite having a powerful ceiling fan).<p>Air-conditioning is not even a hundred years old and was originally not even invented to keep people cool (it was invented to keep machines from overheating).<p>How did free people stay thriving and productive during summer in places like Florida, and the American South where there&#x27;s not only extreme heat but also extreme humidity?<p>Is it a case of:<p>- temps have gotten hotter more recently?<p>- if I had continued my experiment, I would have eventually gotten used to the heat and learned to thrive in it?<p>When it gets extremely hot around here, I think a lot about Bedouins with all their layers of clothes in unimaginable heat. I also think about photos of Americans from around a hundred years ago when all men seemed to be dressed in suits and a hat. Such a mystery to me. (And yes, I realize the Bedouins wear all those layers to protect themselves from hot wind. But still, it must feel like an oven in there.)",
