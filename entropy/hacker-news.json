It&#x27;s a pretty ingenious workaround.<p>This is way more lucrative than any other scam in the world. A single video can make $300k , or about the same as a large ransomware payout, but without having to worry about the Secret Service, the FBI, or having tainted crypto.<p>YouTube is trying to stop these videos by algorithmically detecting certain characters and other markers indicative of the scam, although the huge profitability of this scam ensures scammers will keep finding ways to innovate and stay a few steps ahead of YouTube.<p>It seems these scammers have unlimited hacked YouTube channels at their disposal, especially high quality channels with a lot of followers and  view history.  You would think YouTube would be able to implement better ways to prevent channels from being hacked and or have systems to lock-out accounts that have indications of being hacked.",
