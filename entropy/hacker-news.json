I used Node&#x2F;Gulp to create a simple system that used the directory structure and JSON files to create the post structure. It worked OK, but I haven&#x27;t updated the blog in a while and moved to a new computer, and now nothing builds.  I now want to start a different blog and would like to go with a similar approach.<p>Ideally, I would like the following:\n- A flat file blog that I can maintain on my desktop and publish to Github, maybe support comments via a service Disqus.\n- Pick between Markdown, HTML or a WSYWYG editor to update posts.\n- Prefrably not PHP based.",
