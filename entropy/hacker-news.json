      "text": "I had this question a while ago, trying to understand what is it about that swiping user experience on dating sites that makes them so appealing?<p>Obviously, the content matters too but I couldn’t get over the fact that just swiping is fun and maybe there is something in there.<p>To test my hypothesis, I started working on this project couple of weeks ago to see if swiping can increase &quot;survey&quot; engagement. The results were actually great in the sample size that I tested.<p>Love to hear your thoughts and feedback: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tuun.app&#x2F;<p>Best,\n Soheil",
