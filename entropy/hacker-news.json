      "text": "Hi HN,<p>(Using a throwaway account for reasons that are hopefully obvious.)<p>Feeling very burned out with my current role. Long story short, I&#x27;m on a small team where no one seems to care about (or maybe even understand?) code quality. I frequently get chastised in PRs for refactoring logic from multiple controllers into service classes, one of the senior devs says he doesn&#x27;t want to adopt the repository pattern because he likes how convenient it is to just be able to type ModelName.save, and I&#x27;m constantly explaining or even defending things like single-responsibility and other basic SOLID concepts.<p>To be clear, 100% behind the fact that these principles can be badly abused, mis-used, mis-applied, etc, but we&#x27;re not talking about that here. We&#x27;re talking &quot;suggesting &#x27;hey maybe we shouldn&#x27;t keep sticking business logic in controllers&#x27; gets greeted by crickets&quot; level of cluelessness&#x2F;ambivalence&#x2F;whatever here.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the industry full-time since 2014, and I&#x27;ve worked at several places where my colleagues genuinely valued and had management support for delivering high-quality code and using good engineering practices, so I know they exist. It&#x27;s just a sea of job boards out there and, so far, I&#x27;ve found that you never really know what you&#x27;re getting into until you actually work at a place.<p>So what are some places that you know of that legitimately have a culture of delivering quality code by a deadline? Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated as I think it&#x27;s time for me to make a change.",
