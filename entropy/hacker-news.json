      "text": "Say, I have three entity types `Senior`, `Junior_A` and `Junior_B`. Each entity specifies access control for other entities. So I can either create tables as follows:<p><pre><code>    Senior, Junior_A, Junior_B, AccessControl\n</code></pre>\nwhere `AccessControl` holds access control details between all the entities. This simplifies the code but could lead to performance issues as everything is put into one table.<p>But, then I can also create the tables as follows:<p><pre><code>    Senior, Junior_A, Junior_B, AC_Senior_Senior, AC_Senior_Junior_A, AC_Senior_Junior_B, AC_Junior_A_Junior_A, AC_Junior_A_Junior_B, AC_Junior_B_Junior_B\n\n where `AC_ABC_XYZ` is a table that holds access control information between entities `ABC` and `XYZ`. This complicates the code as the code now has to handle different tables depending on the entity types involved, but will improve performance.\n</code></pre>\nWhich design would you prefer, and why?",
