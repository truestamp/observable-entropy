Not only that, it gives you new perspectives and provides newer ways to think.<p>I am not talking about books that teaches you the API and frameworks and tells you how to accomplish something in the real-world, like a React or Django book.<p>I am looking for suggestions of books where programming (not framework&#x2F;standard library API calling) is used to accomplish something.<p>Any language is fine. Any MOOC or playlist is fine, too.<p>Some examples:<p>1. <i>Nature of Code</i><p>2. <i>Classic Computer Science Problems in Python</i><p>3. <i>Math Adventures with Python</i><p>4. <i>Realm of Racket</i><p>5. <i>Digital Signal Processing in Python</i> by Allen Downey<p>6. <i>Python Playground</i> by Mahesh Venkitachalam<p>7. <i>Hands-on Rust</i> by Herbert Wolverson",
