I&#x27;m an academic so I&#x27;m not really after trivial pop, but something that deals with the concepts at stake (energy, work, conservation, entropy, Maxwell demon, etc etc), their history, but from the ground up. I also can&#x27;t stand overly-excitable YouTubers, so ideally not that either.",

I haven&#x27;t diagnosed yet but very likely to have it.<p>Just wanted to ask before I go down the rabbit hole knowing that Adderral maybe doesn&#x27;t exist in UK and Ritalin is very expensive so basically do people even get properly treated here?",
