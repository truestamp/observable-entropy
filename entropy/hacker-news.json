      "text": "I know this is a subjective thing, but I think it could spark a good discussion on UX.<p>When someone rides a segway they tend to not look cool, despite the fact that they&#x27;re actually pretty fun to ride around. Contrast this with hoverboards which are generally cooler looking than a segway while still maintaining the same basic function. There&#x27;s also other modes of transportation like bikes, roller blades, vehicles, and running that are generally seen as being cooler than riding a segway. One can definitely look uncool while using these other modes of transportation, but it&#x27;s easier to look uncool on a segway than it is with any of those.<p>So I guess my question boils down to this: What design decisions are a part of the segway that make it so easy to look uncool when compared to other modes of transportation?",
