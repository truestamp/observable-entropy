Data of covid disease in kids and how it is different compared to adults &#x2F; young adults (on deaths, hospitalization, long covid among others).<p>2. Data on efficacy of vaccines across time and strains.<p>3. Data on how vaccine trials conventionally proceed for kids and how the covid trials are different.<p>4. Data on how vaccines impact children&#x27;s growth long term.<p>The goal of this post is to collect information on authoritative, peer reviewed scientific data and literature. This can help parents to make an informed personal decision based on their individual situation.",
