      "text": "With improvement of 5-year survival rate with cancer patients, we have seen more and more patients with developed multiple Brain Metastasis (BMs). In the past, for patients with more than 3 or 5 BMs, the limited treatment methods such as surgery&#x2F;Chemotherapy could only improve treatment outcome to a certain degree and a huge portion of the patients cannot take these operations. The whole brain radiotherapy is a once-in-a-lifetime treatment due to the accumulated radiation dose on health issue. In recent years, Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) becomes a popular alternative to other treatment options for these patient population. However the huge amount of multiple BMs (we have seen patients w&#x2F; more than 100 BMs in certain cases) requires time-consuming tasks for physicians to manual delineation and labeling of these brain mets, manual treatment session splitting and manual image follow-up and dose tracking after radiation treatment. So we have built a platform to automate and streamline the whole workflow. And this platform has already been undergoing NIH clinical trial phase I&#x2F;II with our collaborating clinics.<p>Our company (NeuralRad LLC, NIH&#x2F;NCI SBIR awardee) has been chosen by the NIH to attend the I-Corp Business Development program. During this process, we are required to perform market research by talking to potential customers (e.g. medical physicists, radiologists and oncology doctors) and decision makers (e.g. division director, administrators) to establish requirements and get feedback on our product (Multiple BrainMets SRS Management Platform). This program will start on March 1st.<p>Would you mind using our meeting invitation link:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calendly.com&#x2F;hao-jiang-1&#x2F;nih-i-corp-customer-discovery-interview?month=2022-03<p>to schedule a time slot at your convenience? I&#x27;m looking forward to talking with you. Also if interested, we could arrange a separate product demo to give your team a more detailed introduction on our NeuralRad multiple BrainMets platform.<p>Hao Jiang<p>CEO<p>NeuralRad LLC",
