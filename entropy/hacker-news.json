      "text": "I am currently using Node-Red for automating a large number of processes at work. It&#x27;s basically a quickly prototyped BE that has proved to be very effective at what we want it to do. The one thing it doesn&#x27;t do - automated testing.<p>Without testing, we are seeing silly issues caused by forgetting simple things like re-enabling nodes, accidentally deploying things that are broken, etc. \nWe would like to create a CI pipeline in the future, but without this testing piece of the puzzle, I don&#x27;t think it is a possibility.<p>Node-Red does have a test option (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;node-red&#x2F;node-red-node-test-helper), but it is not very robust, and it&#x27;s currently in beta. It is very frustrating to develop tests using this package add-on. The tests are also subject to breaking very easily if the id of a node that you are testing ever changes (say someone deleted and replaced the node with the same node).<p>Are there any other low code solutions that we can use to manage these internal processes that have robust testing for developing a CI pipeline?",
