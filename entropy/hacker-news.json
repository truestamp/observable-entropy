      "text": "Hey all! We are looking for fellow [dev&#x2F;QA&#x2F;Academia&#x2F;UI] folks who would benefit from a service that auto-populates their data source with relevant dummy data. As fellow developers, we know how annoying accessing relevant dummy data can be! We plan on generating the relevant dataset&#x2F;framework without accessing your production database. We will seemly just chat with you about your needs, and let our tool do the magic!<p>We are in &quot;pre-MVP&quot; mode, and we will be providing this service for free for a short period of time!<p>If you think you will be a good fit (or know someone that would be), feel free to send us an email at fakedataearlyaccess@gmail.com with your name and a brief intro of your company&#x2F;project.<p>All the best!",
