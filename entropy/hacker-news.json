      "text": "Nowadays every e-commerce platform is supplied with a search system. It&#x27;s performance (as in relevant result to user input) usually lacks at it best and just plainly inefficient. Same pattern is observed both in opensource and commercial systems.<p>The problem is quite trivial - few thousands of products having name, description, categories, maker&#x2F;brand, tags (keywords assigned to the product exposing relevant characteristics of it). Piecing everything together with assignment of proper weight coefficients (for sorting) is something tricky.<p>Are there any systems (preferably opensource but commercial would be fine as well) or approaches (methodology?) I am missing? Maybe good articles exposing how big companies like amazon maintain it&#x27;s search systems? Anyone having experience of building search systems willing to share experience?<p>Appreciate any feedback.",
