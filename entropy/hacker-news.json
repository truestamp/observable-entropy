They&#x27;re never clean, I can always see dust and lens flares which means all my software has to be in nightmode. I can feel them on my ears all the time, it doesn&#x27;t matter how good my glasses are I&#x27;m just constantly aware of my ears. I hate breaking them in, I&#x27;ve been wearing the same glasses for 5 years. And contacts are not a good solution for me, (this is literally just me) the first time I fail to get one in my mind is filled with every frustrating event thats ever happened to me and I can&#x27;t continue.<p>The correct solution for me is to get my eyes lasered, but thats expensive, dangerous, and involves a recovery period.<p>I don&#x27;t mind wearing my glasses all day. I just wanted to ask if someone knew a better way?",
