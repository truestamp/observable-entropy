We want to ensure the promise of working at Coinbase matches the experience of being here. In the last 3 months, we’ve hired ~600 people. It is important we reiterate how we are thinking about building our company and culture at this rate of growth. We want to be transparent that there is no initiative in place to specifically reduce the intensity of the hours our jobs demand, and that we don’t intend to limit our ambitions by a traditional 40 hour work week, and come together to continue to build Coinbase.&quot;",
