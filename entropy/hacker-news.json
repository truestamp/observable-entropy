      "text": "I work at a startup. I haven&#x27;t liked it for a while, and have decided I want to leave. I&#x27;ve been there for about 6 years.<p>I want to keep my equity. I have NSOs, and would have to execute within 90 days of leaving. I think there&#x27;s a decent chance it will be worth a decent amount of money in the next few years. I don&#x27;t plan to execute with my own money, as the cost to do so is ~100k. I also don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any chance I could execute with a loan or anything like that.<p>I plan to ask for an extension of the 90 days to execute. If it&#x27;s extended, I would stay at the company for 6 months or so to allow for a smooth transition. If it&#x27;s not extended, I would leave immediately.<p>I&#x27;m a key employee. If I were to leave abruptly, it would likely serious cause problems for the company.<p>Am I crazy? Should I be asking for something else in order to keep my equity?",
