      "text": "I don&#x27;t know if this is just a phase or something, but it&#x27;s starting to get to me.<p>Not too long ago I asked HN &quot;I&#x27;m interested in so many disciplines, but what can I do with that?&quot; [1], and got an overwhelming response (to which I still haven&#x27;t gone through completely..!). It really got my brain going and got me out of my slump, and I&#x27;m more eager than ever to pursue this line of interest. However, more recently, I&#x27;m starting to get disillusioned and confused about the <i>social</i> aspects of being a generalist.<p>It&#x27;s a bit confusing to explain (because it is confusing me): Before that Ask HN, I&#x27;ve only been pursuing these interests privately. Since then, I&#x27;ve met several like-minded individuals through HN and it&#x27;s all very very exciting. But now my idealistic brain is starting to wonder, <i>where else can I find more generalist intellectuals? Is there some community out there where we all gather around and discuss over-arching themes and ideas?</i><p>Up to this point, the only places I know with smart nerdy people are all highly specialized. For example, academic spaces for &quot;real&#x2F;published academics&quot;, subreddit for specific interests in philosophy or psychology, etc. There&#x27;s no place where people with general interests gather, other than maybe clustering around particular individuals (eg substack newsletter followers).<p>I know there are <i>many</i> &quot;learning communities&quot;, but those are not really what I&#x27;m looking for. (Maybe I&#x27;m arrogant but those feel very... uncritical...). The best place so far, is the HN crowd.<p>But, then, with HN, there&#x27;s no good way to have sustained conversations on particular topics. And for most of the cross- or interdisciplinary problems that I can think of, there&#x27;s a real <i>need</i> for sustained discussions.<p>Am I dreaming up something that doesn&#x27;t exist? Are small clusters the best we have?<p>Or maybe (I think this is the &quot;answer&quot;), there are only <i>networks</i> of these people and interests groups, rather than one single centralized <i>community</i>. And because every individual generalist and every individual general interest group are characterized by a unique assemblage of interests, only <i>networks</i> can connect these people together. Am I on the right track here?<p>Sorry for the stream of confusion. I would love to know what you all think.<p>[1]: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30928105",
