So far we have handled all our employees computers (we have a team for the servers) manually, but we are reaching the stage where it is way too combersome for us. We are looking for solutions (or third party that does the management) that would help us to manage updates (Mac, windows and eventually Linux), software deployment, security fixes, auditing... We are not interested in screen capture, keylogging or anything like that. Would you have any companies that do IT management that you enjoy working with or solutions that would help us reduce our workload there? Is that the right way to handle that?",
