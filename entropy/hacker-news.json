When the button is pressed, it adds one vote to the item&#x27;s score, and reflects this to the user by incrementing the counter by one. So &quot;like(1)&quot; becomes &quot;like(2)&quot; and then &quot;like(2)&quot;.<p>However, it seems to me like to someone using a screen-reader, it may not be accessible, meaning they won&#x27;t understand what happened.<p>Does anyone know the proper way to handle this? Should I insert an aria alert element to the page, next to the voting button?",
