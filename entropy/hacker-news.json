      "text": "I&#x27;m building a website that is run of the mill CRUD (and am considering adding a mobile app in the future). I have written the backend API in Django and the frontend in React. However, I realized too late that a core marketing part of my project is SEO: React won&#x27;t cut it then. I&#x27;m considering rewriting the frontend in Next.js (to solve the issues with SEO), or just completely rewriting everything in Django. I&#x27;ve looked through a few past HN discussions about the state of web development, but I still can&#x27;t decide which is better. Right now I&#x27;m leaning towards Next.js because it would be less work&#x2F;time porting React to Next.js vs Django for the frontend; this would let me launch quicker, which is quite valuable.<p>Do I go with the shiny new thing, or tried and true framework? Also, what do you use as your tried and true tech stack for new projects?",
