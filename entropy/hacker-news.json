      "text": "As the codebases I work in scale, I&#x27;m wondering how to think about finding &amp; detecting problems to important business logic earlier on, ideally during development.<p>The main ways to protect against regressions that I know about are 1) having a large set of (mostly integration-level, for me) automated tests, 2) adding business metric monitors, and 3) periodic manual human QA. Wondering if there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;m missing.<p>With a growing codebase, the number of tests written gets almost out of control, and it&#x27;s unclear which are the important ones. I&#x27;ve also seen business metrics being recorded in a place that &quot;misses a spot&quot; or otherwise breaks independently of the actual thing it&#x27;s measuring, too. And there&#x27;s no way to know the human flows are operating at the right granularity.<p>Is this something everyone just figures out ad hoc? What am I missing?",
