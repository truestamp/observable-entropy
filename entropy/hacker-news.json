      "text": "Here is an existential threat looming on us. Italy is seeing one of the most severe drought in 70 years, Marmolada glacier just collapsed killing 10 people (more are dispersed). Italian agricultural production will be down - 30% this year. There is a high probability of a food crisis in the upcoming years. We have a 50% probability of surpassing 1.5 degree in the next five years, the 1.5 degree limit was set in the Paris agreement because it is considered to be safe. Scary feedback loops like the permafrost one are waiting us reinforcing the warming even more.<p>So what are we doing as humanity to solve this problem? Nothing.\nWhat do you think we should do?\nwhy do you think we aren&#x27;t talking about it?",
