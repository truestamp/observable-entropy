      "text": "I started noticing this and thought I must be going crazy, but now anytime you follow a link to facebook or instagram (for instance, social media icons on business&#x27; websites), firefox will navigate to the link, then open a new tab while closing the old one.<p>Chrome avoids this, and if I try typing close() in the inspector I get a message &quot;Scripts may close only the windows that were opened by it.&quot; which sounds like a good security feature so someone&#x27;s scripts don&#x27;t go closing my tabs and disappearing my back-button&#x2F;history with it!<p>Of course I can CTRL-SHIFT-T to open the recently destroyed tab. Is this some kind of bug or does this serve a purpose?",
