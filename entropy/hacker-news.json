Very confident in my craft, and just beginning to apply to jobs at mid-large companies.<p>Thing about mid-large companies is their hiring processes can be SLOW and I could use the cashflow sooner rather than later.<p>So I&#x27;m curious if anyone here has ideas on how to make quick cash within a week&#x2F;month. Would love to leverage my engineering skillset (web development-react,typescript,node,postgres) but am open to any and all ideas folks may have.<p>Currently residing in the US.",
