      "text": "We&#x27;ve all been subject to the god-awful experience that is hiring in our industry, but personally I&#x27;ve had experiences bad enough that I think it&#x27;s time for me to stop and &quot;debug&quot; my &quot;process&quot;. (Quotes very intentional here!)<p>The problem is that every time I get rejected, it&#x27;s almost always (easily 90%+) right after the final interview, on-site, the all day panelist thing. Now a few times, no problem, but over the last 10 years we&#x27;re talking easily 65+ here. So something&#x27;s clearly wrong. But the worst part is, when I&#x27;ve asked for feedback, I NEVER hear a word back!<p>So I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong, but clearly somehting&#x27;s up. I need a skilled consultant that produces real results, and I&quot;m willing to pay for that help. Thing is, I&#x27;m not aware of anybody out there who does this for real.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of services that let you record practice interviews and feed them to some AI, but that seems about as useful as a campfire in hell. Plus, give some company somewhere video recordings of myself? Privacy issues seem inherent, inevitable with that.<p>So no apps, I want a real human who knows what the hell they&#x27;re doing and can help me really figure out what&#x27;s going on here. I just don&#x27;t know (a) IF that&#x27;s a thing, (b) what to search for (&quot;interview consultants&quot;? lol no, way too generic), or (c) how to evaluate them to see if they really can help.<p>Since our industry has such a &quot;unique&quot; (more accurate term: &quot;broken&quot;) hiring process (recurring nightmare), this needs to be an industry-specific thing somehow. I figure if anyone knows anything, it&#x27;s ya&#x27;ll.<p>So, any suggestions? Thanks :)",
