I am documenting my struggles here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ve4T-vKV6zU<p>Each month, I will pick a project that I 100% commit to and see how far this takes me.<p>When I say 100%, I really mean it (even if it entails selling software from the back of a trunk).<p>Do you have any ideas that I could focus on?<p>------<p>Background:\nI am relatively proficient in C++ and CUDA. Also did some things in Javascript. I am OK at mathematics, I wrote a book about probability and how to implement multigrid procedures on gpus (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keinefirma.xyz&#x2F;pages&#x2F;fluid_tutorial&#x2F;). But I am open to learn more!",
