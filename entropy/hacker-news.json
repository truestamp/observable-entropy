      "text": "Hey hey,<p>My girlfriend is an environmental scientist but is currently learning to code. She&#x27;s done a bootcamp (Scrimba, JavaScript), and now is working on a side project of mine&#x2F;ours (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript)[0]. I think it&#x27;s a great way for her to learn, since it&#x27;s a real project with real users and I can give her feedback in PR reviews, like it&#x27;s done in the real world.<p>Eventually, she wants to get a proper job as a junior dev, to get the experience of work in a bigger team and not just with me, and to see how she likes this profession.<p>Do you have any tips on how to find a junior dev role without a traditional computer science background? Most job listings I see are for more experienced devs...<p>Thanks!<p>0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;shafy&#x2F;fugu",

      "text": "Hey there,<p>So I&#x27;ve been working on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buymeadomain.com which is a platform for founders &amp; indie hackers to raise their first-ever round of funding in the form of &quot;domain-name investment&quot;. They can submit about their project&#x2F;startup idea along with the domain-name needed &amp; an interested investor can buy them the domain in return of a certain equity.<p>I did some soft launches &amp; got some feedback. The thing is that this is not making sense to many people out there. They are saying that if a founder can&#x27;t buy even a domain-name why would anybody invest in him or that the domain per say is not such a big investment &amp; there are many other expenses like hosting &amp; all.<p>After all this feedback, I&#x27;m thinking of pivoting this into some sort of product hunt for investors where founders can submit there project, create a buzz, get signups &amp; thus attracts investors. The investors can browse along the products &amp; invest in any of them as an angel investor.<p>But then again as per Y Combinator&#x27;s Michael Siebel, great ideas always sound horrible at first &amp; people think they are not good enough. What do you think? Is this the case with buymeadomain.com or do I really need to pivot it to what I described above?<p>Let me know your thoughts .",
