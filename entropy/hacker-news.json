      "text": "Today&#x27;s something very strange happened for me where I live (Turkey). I got a health insurance offer (from Allianz) that precluded certain conditions (thyroid related). I had made a request about 10 months ago from the same provider, and had not had this excluded set of conditions from the insurance policy, but had decided to not proceed. Since then, I have had a private blood test and a private MR for thyroid. I paid for both myself in full, one in cash. When I showed the results of the test and the MR to my doctor last year, he concluded that I had no thyroid related condition to worry about and I decided to get a private health insurance. I wonder how the health insurance provided has heard of this set of tests I had done. I can think of only a clandestine transfer of data from the hospital and lab where the MR and blood test were done which does not adhere to the national equivalent of GDPR. I am not sure what I could do to prevent this kind of thing except moving elsewhere with better privacy procedures.",
