      "text": "Given the huge amount of work that goes into something like a SOC 2 audit, I&#x27;m just curious if there is any data that this process <i>actually</i> improves security. For example, some of the largest security breaches in recent history, like the supply chain attacks with SolarWinds, were in part due to following &quot;best practices&quot; required by things like SOC 2. Plenty of the items in SOC 2 seem like good recommendations, but there is a ton of &quot;box-ticking&quot;. I&#x27;m just curious if there have ever been any studies on SOC 2 audits, for example are data breaches less likely to occur in audited companies.",
