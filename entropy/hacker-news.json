I speak about my experience of learning this about myself<p>- The Blindboy Podcast, episode title Intrapersonally Speaking, from 12 April 2022 \n(hosted by acast but their site has a cookie banner and I know how vociferous many of us are about that)<p>It is in part because of stories like these that I promote early-childhood education (which is largely for the caregiver(s)) as one of the best returns on investment of our collective resources. Please consider lobbying your elected officials to expand ECE to reach every new parent. In the USA each state sets the threshhold of disability (of the child) required for ECE services. Even if my child did not qualify I was so ignorant that ECE classes were a huge help in giving better than I got.<p>Hack the system to improve it. Please add other advice as you see fit.",
