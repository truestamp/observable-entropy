I&#x27;ve recently made a post about challenges of talking to users and decided to make another post. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31178577<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting topic and I want to learn more about it.<p>So, I&#x27;ve made lists of problems that I&#x27;ve found for now:<p>- Getting users to do 1-on-1 interviews more frequently\n- Parse &amp; group users requests by topics (by features, by bugs)\n- Targeting subset of users: users who are willing to pay, users who stopped using a product, users who like product but won&#x27;t be paying.\n- Instantly reaching out to users<p>Do you know some other problems ?",
