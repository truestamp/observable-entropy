      "text": "I have a masters degree in CS and I am working in the industry (let’s say one of the FAANG). I have always wanted to PhD, but couldn’t because I had things to take care of.\nNow that I have settled in the industry for last few years, I want to do more research. So I have been wondering if there are legit places that provide part time PhD, and if there is any chance that those PhDs can eventually lead to a career in academia (as a professor)?",

      "text": "It seems in the past 3 months, Twitter now is showing a lot more tweets in your timeline from ppl you dont follow. Based on topics you’ve liked, ppl whose tweets you interacted with once, or tweets most of your followers interacted with.<p>As a result, when I now open Twitter the first things I see are these awful self-help type threads from “gurus” with their long threads giving out advice. Or gifs&#x2F;memes that were taken from TikTok.<p>It has really ruined the Twitter experience for me. I guess i probably need to cut down my followers or use lists more.",
