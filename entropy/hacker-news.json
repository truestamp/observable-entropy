      "text": "This year, I have resolved to finally organize my family photos and videos: to find and organize decades of digital photos and videos, scan old prints, and set up cloud sharing with extended family and friends.  As I was pondering options for a cloud photo service, I had a vision of being able to attach audio commentary (like a director&#x27;s commentary track) to photos and videos.  I would love for my kids to grow up and be able to hear reminiscences from their parents, grandparents, etc.  Ideally, these attachments would be tightly coupled and discoverable, but most importantly exportable and able to be backed up&#x2F;archived permanently.  Organizing photo albums without any context seems so antiquated.  Yet, traditional social media services are too free-form, ephemeral, and lack intimacy.\nHas anyone here tried to put together anything similar?  Are there any services that target this niche?",
