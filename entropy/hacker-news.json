      "text": "In a previous project we went with SNS&#x2F;SQS for our event bus, because of simplicity. I wondered towards the end if Kinesis would have been better.<p>The main reason in my mind being one less API&#x2F;component, ordered streams, and replayability. SNS&#x2F;SQS made it a bit painful to replay events. The counterpoint seems that Kinesis has some complexity around scalability that you might not need to worry about, depending on the usage.<p>But I&#x27;ve never used Kafka&#x2F;Kinesis so I can&#x27;t say. What are your thoughts?",
