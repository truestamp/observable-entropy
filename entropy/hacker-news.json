      "text": "Hey there, I am Honey - Co-founder at Locofy.<p>We, along with other makers, have been building Locofy.ai to help massively accelerate the builders - the designers, developers, product managers &amp; founders, and we&#x27;re excited to share it today with the HN Community.<p>Locofy.ai simply converts designs into production-ready frontend code for web and mobile apps. It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.<p>With this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.<p>Today, we have also launched on Product Hunt. Let us know your thoughts and suggestions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;locofy-ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;locofy-ai</a>.<p>Our team will be answering all your questions!",
