      "text": "I&#x27;m off track because I&#x27;m slow. I&#x27;m slow because of context switching (fullstack in multiple stacks and working in several different systems with frequent switching). There&#x27;s nothing the team can do about the context switching. My manager agrees with all this. My conclusion is to leave the team for a team environment more conducive to my development. This won&#x27;t be allowed because we have 4 unfilled positions from people leaving over the past few months, which leaves me (midlevel), a junior, and a contractor who&#x27;s term is up in Nov and can&#x27;t be extended.<p>So I&#x27;m too valuable to be allowed to go to another team, but I&#x27;m not valuable enough to recieve an average rating. I&#x27;m also being told to stay in a team that is detrimental to my progression. This team also doesn&#x27;t have a senior dev or tech lead to provide guidance. Oh, and the team is expected to absorb the tech lead functions while we don&#x27;t have one.<p>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m safe from being fired for the next few months while they try to fill all these positions, but I&#x27;m afraid of the longterm consequences of telling the truth and speaking my mind. I was almost fired once for similarly telling the truth in a skip level.",
