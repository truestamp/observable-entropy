      "text": "It&#x27;s very common for people to complain about how many things clutter the screen in &#x27;the modern web&#x27;, and this has definitely come up on HN. People seem to strongly dislike cookie prompts, and I wonder why?<p>For one, it&#x27;s a tiny point of friction - if the site is optimized it shows up quickly and you can click OK in a second. Are we so sensitive to minor inconvenience? I thought about this just now while opening a site and having to accept cookies, and it being really quick if slightly annoying.<p>Second, is this not a good inconvenience to have? Another common complaint about the modern web is the lack of privacy and sites being heavy with reliance on JS and just not being optimized. Having these toggles means the site presumably has to work without cookies, which seems good?<p>Lastly, the laws that require this represent protection of our data. While cookies may not be a huge deal, I do think acceptance of such legislation could enable further requirements about what data is collected and can be deleted. Is this too optimistic?",

The problem with this, is that when you receive an email and it gets forwarded to Slack, Slack then notifies you by email that you have an unread chat message, which in turn notifies you in Slack that you have an unread email, which...    OK you get the point!",
