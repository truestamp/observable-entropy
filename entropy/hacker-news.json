      "text": "Hi everyone. I recently got hired at a big tech company as a senior engineer. I&#x27;m a &quot;new&quot; senior in the sense that I recently turned 27, so my years of experience is relatively small.<p>The language(s) and tooling are all new to me. I&#x27;ve been studying the code in-depth and asking questions, but want to be a valuable member of the team. What things would you recommend someone in my position to do?<p>I&#x27;m fairly quiet, so one of the bigger challenges has just been trying to socialize remotely and be an empathetic team member whilst balancing the technical difficulties of the work. Anyways, would love to hear your experiences.",
