      "text": "Hi there.<p>I am a fairly experienced developer and technical managers who is currently working in a mid-sized software agency, and we&#x27;re seeing a lot of our incoming work start to relate to Web3. I have a cursory knowledge of Web3, particularly cryptocurrency, but I&#x27;d like to spend the next few months getting smart on this topic (for personal and professional reasons).<p>I am not interested in switching careers or learning how to trade cryptocurrency, which is what I tend to find when I Google around. I&#x27;m more looking for in-depth readings about what Web3 enthusiasts believe will happen with the internet, and what the short and medium-term implications of those beliefs are.<p>I tend to prefer long-form articles and books, but that may be unrealistic for a field that is changing so quickly. Every time I ask this question to friends and colleagues, the answer is &quot;Twitter&quot; but I am not a avid Twitter user, so advice on who to follow and what that looks like would be helpful too.<p>Outside of that - can HN recommend any resources for someone in my position? Happy to answer any more questions in the comments.",
