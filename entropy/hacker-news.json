The user will scan the QR code to see the menu. The revenue generated through ads will be split between the restaurant and me. It will help the restaurant generate secondary income. The traditional POS systems are expensive and are burden to small restaurants and food trucks. I am thinking of giving the POS system for free and earn using the ad revenue. One of my observations is that people spend more time on reading the menu than the Instagram Post. What are your thought on this?",
