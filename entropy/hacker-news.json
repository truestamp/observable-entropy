I&#x27;d like to get 8+ hours of sleep and go to bed before midnight, but after countless attempts, my body always reverts back to this ~3:00am sleep schedule. I&#x27;ve tried everything: melatonin, not eating past 6pm, reducing caffeine intake, regular exercise, but none of it seems to have a lasting effect.<p>To anyone who has had a less-than-desirable sleep schedule, how did you fix it?<p>Thanks!",
