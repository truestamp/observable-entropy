      "text": "Does anybody know if Apple M1 chip supports iGPU passthrough (like Intel GVT-g.. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;title&#x2F;Intel_GVT-g) or sharing with a virtual machine?<p>Last year I did a hobby project on my Intel MacBook where I passed through the shared iGPU to a windows VM running on Linux and it worked very well with minimal performance penalty after full optimizations. I don&#x27;t even know if AMD supports this feature, but would Apple M1 support it? Thanks",
