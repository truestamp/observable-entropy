What about clocks?<p>Nixies&#x2F;VFDs&#x2F;Numitrons are pretty popular, with DIY kits or premade options from places like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kama-labs.com&#x2F; (they use their own new PCBs in conjunction with original tubes)<p>Two panel flip clocks or rotating drum assemblies were popular in Japan and the US, but less reliable than even nixie clocks.<p>Quartz desk clocks with added features like barometer&#x2F;hygrometer are neat, albeit an even narrower niche.<p>What other types of clocks are worth looking at for collecting?",
