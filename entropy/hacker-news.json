      "text": "I work currently as a &quot;senior&quot; swe and my duties cover a wide range of technologies and non-tech related stuff: Elixir, Go, nginx, mysql, Docker, debezium, Kafka, Terraform, Ansible, HTTP APIs, a bit of Angular, mentoring, hiring (tech interviews), product discovery, design docs drafts, etc., etc.<p>When it comes to hiring senior software engineers, my company and peers seems to put a lot of focus on the following topics:<p>- does the candidate know about performance, scalability, and high availability topics?<p>- does they know about infra topics like: K8s, monitoring, CI&#x2F;CD<p>- does they know about GCP or AWS?<p>- are they available to be part of our on-call rotation schemes?<p>- can they mentor more junior engineers?<p>Not to mention of course the more classic requirements for senior software engineers like: actual working experience on the field, solid knowledge of the fundamentals of comp sci&#x2F;soft. eng., good practices, problem solving skills, good communication skills, etc.<p>When I interview candidates, I try to focus on the second group of requirements. I want to see if the candidates are able to communicate effectively while working on a technical solution. I could care less about details like GCP, Ansible, the programming language they master the most, or whether they use K8s or not. These technologies can be learned, if required. My company, though, doesn&#x27;t like my approach and they insist on me asking very specific tech questions.<p>What do you think? We currently are hiring &quot;Go senior software engineers&quot; (that&#x27;s the actual job title in Linkedin), but I couldn&#x27;t care less if you know Go or not when you come to work with me. I want to know if you are good at solving problems.",
