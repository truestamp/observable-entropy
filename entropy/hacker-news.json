I like the feedback you get and the way it shapes the work.<p>It&#x27;s cool when you can build software and someone runs it on their own data just a short while later and has a direct line of communication to you, providing a tight feedback loop.<p>I quit my job a few months ago and in a few months I&#x27;ll have to find a new one. I thought I&#x27;d see if anybody had any ideas for tools they wanted to see written that lined up with my interests and that I could try my hand at, to see if I could make a go of working on dev tools for myself before going back into the job market.",
