      "text": "I had an interview with a company based on US, for a position of senior full stack developer. He gave some questions related to my current role as senior developer. More or less here&#x27;s the topic:<p>- explaining my work experience\n- how I manage or assign tasks to my subordinate\n- what is a leader means to me\n- how do I handle my subordinate mistakes &#x2F; misdemeanor\n- how is the situation in my company and how can I do to change it<p>Then I had another interview with different company, they go with more technical questions here:<p>- asks to share some code I can show and explain to them\n- about how I manage css\n- about ci&#x2F;cd pipeline\n- about react hooks<p>Now I think there are some project management role in the first one and infra &#x2F; devops role in the second one (I&#x27;m more inclined towards this one). So what is the company really expect me to able to?",

      "text": "I was wondering today ..what with all the noise about social media and dopamine addiction ..why not use the dopamine hits from Insta or FB clicks as a therapeutic way for depression or other mild brain chemical imbalance issues.<p>Some behavioural or depressive states can be resolved with talk therapy. A trained therapist can help people navigate with social media as therapy and gently nudge the patient back into health so it doesn’t slip into negative territory.<p>Or is this already done&#x2F;implemented? If attention seeking is a way to get the dopamine hits, why not use it as a guided healing modality?<p>I am not sure I buy the theory that social media is all bad. Some people have come out of their shell and gain friends and have had a net positive experience. They used to say this with video gaming too back when…but surely all them kids didn’t turn out to be suicidal or anti social thugs?",
