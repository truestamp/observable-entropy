      "text": "I have received an offer of employment which includes an employee covenants agreement with numerous restrictive clauses applicable for the two year period after the end of employment. For context I am an individual software engineer.<p>Clauses include non-solicitation of customers&#x2F;prospective customers, non-compete, non-recruit, non-disparagement, injunctive relief, and and attorney&#x27;s fees.  The two that feel somewhat iffy to me are the non-recruit and the non-disparagement clauses.<p>Question for HN: what is the tech industry standard these days for the content of employment agreements? If you were me would you sign this or would you push back?",
