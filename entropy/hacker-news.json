      "text": "WTF Twitter Lists!<p>I&#x27;m trying to make a list of accounts on Twitter using Twitter Lists. The UI in tweetdeck says you can add up to 100 accounts at a time.<p>Their anti-spaming tools clearly are creating a ton of crazy hidden rules that contradict their interface or documentation.<p>Turns out you can add only 40 at a time. But actually there&#x27;s more shadow rules, because they limit you to adding that many every 15 minutes! Of course the error messages don&#x27;t say this, takes experimentation.<p>Using API is even more janky. API calls say 300 &quot;requests&quot; every 15 min, but this also results in lock-outs.<p>Moreover, once you encounter a &quot;shadow lock-out&quot;, you can&#x27;t add to the list at all! You can&#x27;t even add to any other list!<p>Twitter, you got all these neat tools. At least be clear WHAT are the rules. and if you work at twitter, please help!! I&#x27;m trying to make cool shit for earth day!",
