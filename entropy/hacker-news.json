      "text": "I recently discovered a chat widget with a generous free tier that covered all of my needs. The goal was to have 2-way communication without the user needing to give their email address. After testing out the service and customizing it to my liking, I removed it from my site and closed my account. Mostly for the following reasons:<p><pre><code>  - It uses cookies and my site doesn’t do any other tracking or have analytics\n  - The UX wasn’t great, the best I’ve seen but still unintuitive.\n  - It was annoying to allow in my content security policy\n  - It slowed down my site\n  - From a user’s perspective I find them annoying\n</code></pre>\nSo I’m wondering, has anyone found a service like this worth using, or that they genuinely like? What is your use case? How does it work?",
