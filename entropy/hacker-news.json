So, I am currently working on a website for a friend and reposted their blog on some websites (very reputable site). However their rel-canonical points to their own website article URL despite saying they provide reblogging and some even said “reposted from… “<p>I understood on my SEO learning so far that rel=canonical must be pointing to the original website. Also I have searched for the blog title on Google and the repost blog shows up first and the main website it not showing up at all on google. I checked on Google search console and the page seems to be indexed.<p>I am really lost and have researched for days to no avail. I would really appreciate any help. Thanks in advance and please let me know if you need additional information.",
