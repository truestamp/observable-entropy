      "text": "Can HN kindly recommend resources for learning how type-checkers work?<p>I&#x27;m looking for entry-level resources geared towards curious engineers.  I have tried to read a number of academic articles on the subject, but I think I am lacking some concrete grounding to make sense of the theory.<p>As such, the ideal resource would involve implementing a non-trivial type checker.  A live-coding course similar to [0] would be ideal, but I will happily accept video lectures, books, blog articles, or any other format.<p>Many thanks in advance!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7pLCpN811tQ",
