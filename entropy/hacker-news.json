      "text": "I&#x27;m able to work on multiple sorts of small tasks along a day. I usually organize them into related chunks, so that I can operate on them more efficiently, but I don&#x27;t have too much trouble on doing the mental &quot;context-switching&quot; involved.<p>However, everything changes when it comes to projects requiring substantial mental effort. It may be hard to begin but, when it gets momentum, it&#x27;s hard to stop. I can work on a project for days, weeks, even months. But it gets really hard to concentrate on other tasks. And especially hard to work on another project of the same magnitude.<p>I realized that for the first time when I took the huge mistakenly decision of starting a company during my masters. I could do a decent volume of work during those years, but my inability of working on them in parallel brought many sorts of problems to my life.<p>Sometimes I think I simply shouldn&#x27;t undertake more than one big project a time -- and I don&#x27;t feel devastated about that. However, I still think that it would be good to have such an ability and, so, I&#x27;d like to know from you guys if you have some strategy.<p>Things I&#x27;ve attempted:<p>- handwriting my thoughts: Sometimes I feel that I can&#x27;t unload my working memory, maybe due to an unconscious fear of losing all the ideas. It seems that writing the ideas down helps me to &quot;convince&quot; my brain that it&#x27;s safe to let all that information go.<p>- doing a bit of over-planning, breaking down a bigger project on smaller, yet sub-optimal tasks: that is probably not the most efficient way to conduct a project, but, by transforming it on a stream of easier tasks, they require less mental resources. Besides, it prevents me to become too &quot;passionate&quot; about the project -- again, sacrificing efficiency for other important things of life.<p>Do you also face such problem? Do you have something interesting to share on this regard?",
