He and his wife claim that they are afraid of long term side effects.<p>When pressed a bit it seems that the concern here is that they are trying for a second child and are afraid of becoming infertile due to the jab. Though it might be just a smoke screen to drop the subject.<p>I am not good with emotional appeal arguments, and this seems like pure facts might not be enough. So maybe suggest emotional argument angle?<p>I probably have one shot at trying to convince them to vaccinate so I am looking for possible any possible advice.<p>PS<p>Some talking points I am trying to use:<p>I have read papers on pregnancies and COVID vaccine - surprise nothing found.<p>Long term effects of vaccines would already show up<p>Delta and future variants are more likely to infect them even when self isolating<p>Covid death rates and Covid long term issues vs unknown mystery long term side effects of vaccine.",
