As of late, I haven&#x27;t had time to create tutorial videos any more.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if you (or anyone you know) are an excellent instructor? Ideally with a computer science background, job and teaching experience, and perhaps tutorial video creation experience.<p>If so, I&#x27;d like to team up with you and give you all of my students. Of course, I only want to offer this to someone who is deeply passionate about teaching, computer science, and real-world programming, and someone who cares deeply about our future programmers. If that&#x27;s you let&#x27;s get in touch!",
