A recent article prompted some good discussions ( [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29379926](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29379926) ). Let&#x27;s continue this conversation.<p>How do you decide whether to spin off a service, and how will it connect and interact with the rest of the system?<p>A service is a capability. It&#x27;s something that allows you achieve a behavior in a system. Functionality should be broken into a service only in places where it makes sense, and provides clear benefits to the system and the team. You can have good service-based architectures that are a pleasure to build and maintain. And yet, there are countless stories of teams breaking their system up into services, and then deciding to go back to a monolith.<p>How do you decide when to develop something as a service?<p>How do you decide when to refactor a system and split some functionality out into a service?<p>Are there any key questions that you must ask your team before deciding to do so?<p>What will make a service-based architecture pleasurable to build and maintain?<p>Can you share any short-form (articles, presentations) or long-form (books, courses) resources to learn how to do this well?",
