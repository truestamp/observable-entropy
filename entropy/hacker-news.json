Even more so if something is going on with my friends or family, then the emotional &quot;weight&quot; on that data is even bigger<p>This means I dedicate more of my energy, time and resources to my local community, which is probably optimal.<p>I also vaguely remember reading Foundations where in the end Isaac Asimov character\nthinks that telepathy is important also because is provides with a greater *feeling* (emotional weights in my sense) of connection between members who share this connection and can share feeling even if physically farther apart.<p>Unless we have case of trekonomics with unlimited clean energy and even in that case there are limited resurces we would need to share if we would like to prevent suffering and pain for a vast majority of people living on Earth.<p>HN what are you thoughts on this?",
