And all the jobs I’ve had before consulting were in B2B. I’ve helped cigarette companies, soda companies, insurance companies, and even governments. I’m starting to worry about my impact on the world. What did I accomplish in helping these companies? How do I apply a DevOps skill set in a way that helps humanity? What should I do if I’m unmotivated by money and more interesting in helping move the world towards a certain ideal? Should I just drop out of tech and do something else with my life? Has tech been lost to the capitalist machines?",
