      "text": "Hi there,<p>I searched around but could not find any documentation how to port software to Apple M1 systems.<p>For example: How did Golang got ported? As far as I know Golang is implemented in Golang and just until some months ago it could not create M1 executables. If Golang would be language implemented in C or C++ I could somewhat guess that you need &quot;just&quot; run the sources through the Apple M1 clang&#x2F;llvm compiler and patch the errors&#x2F;warnings until it works.<p>Or another example: How do they port Linux to M1? I mean you need binutils-glibc-gcc to get Linux and other neccessary tools like grub running. Does binutils have a port to M1? Does gcc create M1 executables? Or does this project not only port the kernel but also the toolchain?<p>On one hand I look forward to the possibility to start one of the very long discussions you can find in the HN community - these are fun to read -.  \nOn the other hand I would also be thankful to get a link to a document I was not able to find.",
