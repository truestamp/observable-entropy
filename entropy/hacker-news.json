      "text": "Say you have the following requirements:<p>- A JSON api that returns a bunch of date-based data, that refreshes daily\n- Represent some of that data in some time series line graphs\n- Display those graphs on a web page that other people can access, so that the data is up to date when they visit<p>What are some of the fastest ways to set this up? I&#x27;m personally trying to set up a covid dashboard specific to my area, for my friends and I to check daily. So far I&#x27;ve tried Google Data Studio hooked up to a Google Sheet that refreshes periodically, but Data Studio is broken half the time. I also have the capability to set up a whole Next.JS website that caches data but that&#x27;s overkill in terms of time&#x2F;effort.<p>Other things I&#x27;ve considered:<p>- jupyter but the html export is confusing and not dynamic, I think.\n- observerablehq but that could also look kind of messy\n- idyll-lang pushed to github pages, but I wonder if there&#x27;s something faster&#x2F;no-code.",
