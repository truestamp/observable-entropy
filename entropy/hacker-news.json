      "text": "Mike Lindell (the MyPillow guy) is currently hosting a cyber symposium with ostensibly cyber security experts discussing how it would be possible to hack voting machines.<p>He mentions packet captures frequently, how they allegedly can&#x27;t be tampered with, and therefore are a potential source of evidence for election interference.<p>Are there any technical networking&#x2F;cyber security folks on HN who can help shed light on this claim and any of his other claims? What is he missing? Alternateively are any of his points valid? Can any experts in the HN community &quot;steelman&quot; his argument?<p>I know there are professors out there like Andrew Appel at Princeton who have done a lot of computer science research into voting machines: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;~appel&#x2F;voting&#x2F;<p>The event stream is at frankspeech [dot] com",
