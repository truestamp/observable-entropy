      "text": "I work in IT and made some adjustments to my lifestyle. Here is my weight every Saturday over 18 months. I am surprised at the amount I still consume. Maybe more what, than how much. Main thing I have learned is that diet is about what you eat over a month, not a day. The massive slice of Snickers Cheesecake, with ice-cream, I had after last night won&#x27;t impact my weight unless I do it regularly.<p>* Walk 2.8 miles daily (so Google fit tells me)\n* Don&#x27;t eat much bread, no butter\n* Skimmed milk\n* Porridge and fruit for breakfast\n* Vegetable curry etc for lunch\n* 4 or 5 pieces of fruit a day\n* Lots of Coke Zero &#x2F; Diluted juice\n* Dinner - whatever\n* Don&#x27;t eat after dinner",
