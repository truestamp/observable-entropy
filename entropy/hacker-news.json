      "text": "Dear HN:<p>What&#x27;s the best or fastest way to build a Yelp for X site?<p>This is for a geographically-oriented niche market where users would submit reviews of a particular type of service provider. It wouldn&#x27;t be pure Yelp because this industry has some unique characteristics. But it would be pretty close.<p>We&#x27;d also need a discussion forum, also geographically-oriented. We might be able to create it using Discourse depending on how easily Discourse can be customized.<p>Is there a SaaS that can make this possible? Toolkits?<p>I could develop it from scratch myself, but it would take months and probably wouldn&#x27;t be as good as what a third party would provide. Ideas?",
