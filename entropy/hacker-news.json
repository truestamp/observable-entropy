      "text": "After being with my previous company for about ten years I recently started a new job, it&#x27;s only been a month but I am already feeling I made the wrong decision. I don&#x27;t regret leaving my old one, but I do wish I continued searching for something I&#x27;d be happier with. The problem is none of the companies I really wanted to work for were interested in me (I&#x27;m terrible at leetcode-type problems and seems the companies I&#x27;m most attracted to are also the ones that favor those the most) and so this new company was far from my first choice but it was a good offer from a place that cared more about my practical experience over my (in)ability to regurgitate and apply algorithms I haven&#x27;t had a need to use since college.<p>I&#x27;ve always gotten much enjoyment out of my work and so this dread-of-working I&#x27;m experiencing presently is entirely new to me, it&#x27;s particularly concerning how quickly into the new job it occurred. What are my best courses of action here? I&#x27;ve come up with a few options but there may be better alternatives that escape me:<p>* try and transfer to a different team within the company to see if things are better on a different one\n* stick it out for a reasonable amount of time (a year?) and start looking for something new\n* start looking for a new job now (though I imagine it&#x27;ll be a gigantic red flag to most employers if I&#x27;m looking for something so soon after starting this one)\n* be open with my manager about the situation and see if she has a solution",
