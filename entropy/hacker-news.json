I guess I can even extend it to where &#x27;n&#x27; is greater than 2, and certain decisions have to be made.<p>But what is the difference between 5 containers and 50 or a thousands? I&#x27;d think at 5 containers you have already dealt with all issues around multi-tenancy. What changes from there to 1000 containers?",
