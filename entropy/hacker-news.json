All other features (like search, live collaboration, grammar suggestions etc.) will work exactly like Google docs.<p>Our hypothesis is that such a service would be compelling to companies that are concerned that Google may share their data with third parties like advertisers or governments.<p>We are currently doing market research to validate the demand for such a service. Is anyone here aware of such a need within their organization? If so, would love to pick your brain to help shape our product.<p>Thank you!",
