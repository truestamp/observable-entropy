      "text": "I&#x27;ve been dealing with a serious health issue that is a major problem in my life, I am in constant pain, I can barely work. My experience with the US healthcare system has been abysmal - I go to a doctor, the doctor sends me to get tests, it&#x27;s 3 weeks, after that another 3 weeks to see a specialist, 3 weeks more for more tests, etc, etc. I&#x27;ve been ping-ponged around for 4 months with little progress in terms of diagnosis.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there is a way to buy better healthcare. Surely Satya Nadella doesn&#x27;t have to go through this. What I would love to do is pay a large amount of money ($50K out of pocket not counting insurance for just the diagnosis) and go through all of the doctors&#x2F;tests in two weeks. Does anyone know where I can do that? The US would be best, but can travel internationally for this too.<p>Would appreciate any pointers people might have, I don&#x27;t even know what to Google. If necessary, the issue is neck-spine related, relevant doctors might be neurologist, rheumatologist, spine surgeon, etc.",
