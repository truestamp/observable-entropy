      "text": "I&#x27;m Robbert, the creator of DataGridXL.js. Last month I released version 2 which includes many new features.<p>DataGridXL is a free (and commercial) editable data table library written in ES6.<p>My goal is to develop the most performant &amp; user-friendly spreadsheet-like data table out there:<p>- It has zero dependencies. You don’t need any framework to use DataGridXL.\n- It is lightweight (~250kb) and easy to use. It does not even require messing with CSS.\n- It has its own Virtual DOM implementation to prevent DOM errors.\n- Developer friendly. Supports all modern web browsers<p>Please take a look at the performance demo (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;demos&#x2F;one-million-cells\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;demos&#x2F;one-million-cells</a>) to see the difference with other data grids out there. And let us know if you have any suggestions.<p>Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments!",
