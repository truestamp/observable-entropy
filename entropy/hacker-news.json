We will be so happy if some of you guys can find applications and will continue building this great product that we believe so much in. Of course,   you will get all the technical help that we can give you.<p>All of these can be exchanged for equity or the return on our investment. Any other advice on these please feel free to email me (in About section). Thanks so much for reading :)",

They sell furniture though, and those images are being flagged for some reason.\nThey haven’t been able to run ads the last few weeks and there is no way to appeal the decision through the app.<p>Does anyone have ideas on how one might try to rectify this?",
