      "text": "Hi Hacker News! Wanted to show you my latest project, Messer: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;de&#x2F;app&#x2F;messer&#x2F;id1586304988?l=en&amp;mt=12&amp;ref=producthunt<p>It&#x27;s a small native app for the most basic task of all: converting, resizing and optimizing images.<p>I&#x27;m currently trying to grow my following, which means I post images a lot, however, these images need to be in a specific format&#x2F;ratio. Usually, I would go to one of the many websites that resize and convert images, but the experience is subpar and it&#x27;s a drag to do this multiple times a day.  \nTherefore I created a fully native app that does this for me, converting an image takes a second and since it&#x27;s deeply integrated with macOS it works by simply dragging and dropping, first you drag your image to the menu bar, adjust your parameters, and then drag the image out directly where you need it<p>There are a couple more features I would like to implement like an embedded code formatter (a la carbon.now.sh or ray.so), so if you know of a Swift library that can output colored&#x2F;formatted code, let me know.<p>Enjoy! (and please rate if possible!)",

      "text": "I am running an indie SaaS company and I intend to continue that work for next 2-5 years. However, it&#x27;s becoming clear to me (especially after becoming a father) that I want to do something that is good for the climate. So I am spawning a background thread in my brain that will ponder what that means in the long run.<p>I can&#x27;t do politics even if that is possibly the most important factor. I don&#x27;t have any skills and I certainly don&#x27;t have the desire. I also don&#x27;t know anything about physics or chemical engineering etc. I think those are skills I <i>could</i> obtain but say I want to capitalize on the developer&#x2F;CTO skills that I have amassed over two decades, where should I be working to maximize my impact?<p>I am slowly educating myself on renewable energy, battery tech, carbon capture and things like that. There are so many frontiers and since everything needs software, I feel that I should be able to help.<p>Should I create a company&#x2F;NGO that creates software for a sector? Or should I try to join something existing and what would that be?<p>Alternatively, where should I start looking? Is there a publication or podcast that I should subscribe to?<p>I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas!",
