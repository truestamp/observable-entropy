      "text": "Hey hackers,<p>I’ve been using a macbook pro on a daily basis for the past 10 years or so.\nFor the past 3 years or so, I’ve been using it constantly plugged in (charging) without an external keyboard&#x2F;mouse.\nThis period closely matches up with the period I’ve been having heart palpitations.<p>I’m an otherwise healthy individual, 28 years old, no previous conditions, athletic body. \nI go running 2x a week, and have a set of bodyweight exercises I perform DAILY, to keep in shape.\nI have never smoked or had any relatives with heart issues.<p>I recently quit caffeine completely, since I was having more and more palpitations daily.\nThe symptoms have improved, but not disappeared.<p>Today, when my girlfriend came to pat me on my arm, she said<p>her: “Wow are you cold?”\nme: “No, why?”\nher: “You’re shivering.” \nme: “Ah, no that’s because, I’m touching my laptop. There&#x27;s a current flowing through me.”\nher: “OMG???”<p>And that’s when it hit me: I’m constantly being electrocuted on a daily basis by my laptop.\nI’ve grown accustomed to the small current that’s traveling through my body for AT MINIMUM 8 hours a day.\nI even adjusted my sitting posture, so that I’m always in full contact with my laptop, in order to avoid partial contact (to avoid THAT painful sting).<p>I know that many of you know about this constant weird buzz, when for example You gently run a finger over your macbook, whilst it’s charging.<p>It can’t be healthy… right???<p>Are any of YOU experiencing similar symptoms or are in a similar situation?<p>Do You know of any research on effects of small current on the human body, over a prolonged period? (unlikely)<p>Are any of You encountering anxiety, tension in chest, near the heart ?",
