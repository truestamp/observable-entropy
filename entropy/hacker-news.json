      "text": "Our analytic number theory book club that began in March 2021 as a result of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26366464 is coming to an end today.<p>The book club blog at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbeat.cc&#x2F;blog&#x2F; provides an account of the journey so far. The best part of hosting and participating in book club meetings like this has been the extremely smart folks I got the opportunity to interact with during the meetings. I learnt so much more about the beautiful subject of analytic number theory by interacting with them than I could have if I were reading the book alone.<p>A big thank you to the Hacker News community and the folks from here who showed interest in this book club, joined our meetings, and made this book club successful. We will have our last meeting on this book today. Everyone is very welcome to join it today even if only to lurk! See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbeat.cc&#x2F;blog&#x2F;analytic-number-theory-book-club-ending-today.html for more details.",
