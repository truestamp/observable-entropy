      "text": "I&#x27;m a hobby cartoonist and I wanted to know how to go about building an AI model that could help me make New Yorker style cartoons<p>I do have a decent amount of experience with ML and have worked with an image to text generator before on the flowers and birds dataset.<p>However this is a very different problem compared to that. For some context, new yorker style cartoons have a scene and a line below the scene which acts as a punchline. The actual scene would represent an another description.<p>For example, the image here is basically of a deserted island but the text below the scene talks about searching for someone. \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CeZSmJ6hr8z&#x2F;?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link<p>I believe it would be better if I just focused on the visual description of the image than the scene based description. But I would love some inputs on that<p>Also would it be possible for me to use a larger text to image model and train it on a few images to get this style of output? Any resources on that would be appreciated!",
