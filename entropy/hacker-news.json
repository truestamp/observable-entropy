      "text": "Hi.<p>I&#x27;ve been using the US-intl keyboard layout for a while, as ABTN2 (the standard Brazilian Portuguese) layout treats &#x27; and &quot; as dead keys, which makes programming incredibly annoying for me.<p>However, US-intl makes accented letters like ã, à and â annoying to type, requiring holding Alt as you press the respective keys.<p>As a solution, I decided to make a small fork of US-intl that changes ~, ` and ^ to dead keys, while leaving &#x27; and &quot; as non-dead keys (as you can easily type á with Alt+a).<p>It&#x27;s nothing major or substantial, but I thought I&#x27;d share it in case some other brazilian &#x2F; portuguese-speaking programmer might need it.<p>You can find it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SkyLeite&#x2F;us-br",
