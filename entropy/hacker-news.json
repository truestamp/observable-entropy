      "text": "Hello,<p>I am working at a small SaaS startup and leading the charge on our cloud infrastructure. I am looking for resources to get educated about cloud architecture patterns and best practices. We are currently on AWS, and while I have a decent amount of experience working with AWS and the cloud, I feel like I am lacking exposure to modern tools and best practices and general patterns. I want to know how other companies and people are building out their cloud infra when it comes to things like:<p>- Monitoring, alerting, log ingestion from multiple services\n- Networking and VPN set up for accessing internal services not exposed to the internet\n- Security best practices<p>I found blog posts like this very helpful:\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mangadex.dev&#x2F;mangadex-v5-infrastructure-overview&#x2F;\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anthonynsimon.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;one-man-saas-architecture&#x2F;<p>I am also currently working through Designing Data Intensive Applications.<p>Any suggestions for similar blogs, books, youtube channels, etc?<p>Thanks!",
