Free &#x2F; open-source is preferable but I&#x27;m OK with a paid solution.<p>I don&#x27;t need, for example, color correction or motion tracking, but need to be able to cut &#x2F; splice video clips, replace and add audio, and add some simple text (with font control) and transitions. And hopefully not tax my CPU (and practically non-existent GPU) too much while working on it.<p>I&#x27;ve used DaVinci Resolve for personal projects and it&#x27;s amazingly fully featured, but too much for a simple instructional video, but it really taxes my laptop CPU (and I don&#x27;t want to get a gaming machine to run DaVinci more efficiently.)<p>On the other hand we have Windows&#x27; built-in video editor which is basically too simple to do anything productive in.",
