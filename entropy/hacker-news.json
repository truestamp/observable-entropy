      "text": "For a SaaS Analytics product it can make sense to  send periodic nice-looking emails showing headline summaries and tables. I am surprised at the lack of low-effort solutions for this, but maybe I am not doing the right google search. This world seems to have its own terminology, like transactional&#x2F;marketing, etc. Hence this Ask HN.<p>Key requirements:<p>- look good on mobile (i.e. responsive)<p>- dynamic content, i.e. templatized, with variables<p>- need to include tabular data with say 5 rows and 3-4 columns<p>- look good with nice designs<p>- Unsubscribe option<p>- Mostly doable in Python<p>We are looking at SendGrid, but I am not impressed with how the emails turn out, especially with tabular data. Mailchimp could be an option, but haven&#x27;t gone down that path.<p>Thank you.",
