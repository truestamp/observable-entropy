      "text": "We are in the middle of a SOC audit and over the last year have migrated most of our apps to docker&#x2F;k8s&#x2F;cloud.   The auditors are asking how we know that a devops person (who does the merging, which then kicks off the automation to deploy to prod) couldn&#x27;t push some code to skim pennies or whatever.  The devops peeps have access to the codebases to do the merges since we still have humans in the mix to bless&#x2F;approve stuff to go to prod (and also because the jenkinsfile and dockerfiles are in there).  We have a bunch of pull-request minded settings in GH, and protected branches, but really it comes down to the devops users only touch a subset of the files in the repo (the non-code ones), and the developers touch the code.  Has anyone had any experience satisfying auditors?  They appear to have never seen anything like this before and there&#x27;s got to be more people who are audited who are doing devops, right?",
