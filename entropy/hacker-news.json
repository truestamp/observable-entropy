      "text": "Hey HN!<p>Alexis here, I’m a product manager and software developer in Berlin by way of New York.<p>I want to show you this app I made – It’s like a &quot;buddy&quot; for those, like myself, who inadvertedly talk too much in meetings.<p>The app gives me feedback and a little more in control of what I have influence over by:<p>- Keeping track of how long I’ve been speaking\n- Catching myself before I talk too much\n- Developing a better sense of timing<p>I truly love having conversations with people in real-life.<p>But online meetings, especially group calls, tend to make me nervous. I can&#x27;t read body language. The tone of voice, micro-experessions and social cues get lost.<p>If you, too, accidentally talk too much too often, check it out &quot;Unblah&quot;. Watch the quick 2-minute demo and download the macOS app over at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unblah.me&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unblah.me&#x2F;</a>.<p>Cheers!<p>Alexis<p>PS: There’s a whole FAQ section for common questions you may have – Including if this is yet another &quot;native&quot; Electron app ;)",
