But how do I pick a programming language?<p>Ruby - seems like a great choice but it&#x27;s &quot;dead&quot; and it seems like it would be hard to get a job (I&#x27;m in Europe)<p>JS&#x2F;Node - Seems to be something most people hate working with while also having tons of flaws<p>Golang - Seems much harder to learn and people don&#x27;t seem to like it either<p>So how do I choose one? How do I start learning a language and which one would you recommend?",

I find myself in places where I am hell lot confused. The resources don&#x27;t suffice at all.<p>I get confused. But the issue is I get help from nowhere. Reddit NO. Stackexchange NO, other forums NO. How would I? As these subjects are studied by very few people as it is higher level of education question, how do I deal with this? Any guidance?<p>Sadly I don&#x27;t have any close friends whom I can ask.",
