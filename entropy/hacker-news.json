      "text": "Hi,<p>I am the CTO of a small Canadian company (20 employees) that develop data platforms for industrial energy management and lean manufacturing. I am confident we offer meaningful and interesting problems to work on and we don&#x27;t have a problem finding candidates to recruit. However, we don&#x27;t really any policy in place to reward people that stay at the company on the long run, beyond money, and we are looking at changing this. As a result, I am curious to know what retention policies are in place in your workplace, especially for companies of similar size ?<p>Some examples:\n- gain x days of vacations after y years\n- working from abroad up to x days per years (we have a lot of foreigners in the team)\n- ...<p>What are the things, beyond job satisfaction and salary, that can make it harder to leave your company?",
