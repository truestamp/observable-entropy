      "text": "Hi HN,\nI am in the process of writing a book and on a smaller scale a small blog post exploring the factors that contribute to a software engineer&#x27;s success. I&#x27;d love to understand more about<p>* What factors contribute to your success (coding, design, communication, finding your purpose, etc.)<p>* What factors were hard for you to master or understand<p>* What areas you&#x27;re working on now<p>I&#x27;ve constructed a survey here<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airtable.com&#x2F;shry2byax5iisFzwq<p>and am offering an incentive of 10 USD as an Amazon gift card to anyone who does fill it out, up to the first 80 people. I&#x27;m polling my friends and colleagues but I&#x27;d love more diverse inputs. I appreciate your responses, the survey may look long but many of the questions are asking for a rating on a scale of 1-5.<p>You are welcome to leave your free form comments on these topics below as well. I&#x27;ll do my best to normalize those inputs, though the survey is preferred.<p>Thanks in advance,\nAmeer",
