      "text": "Not sure if its just some A&#x2F;B testing, but youtube comments no longer displaying for me below the video at all since an hour ago.  They all appear in a little box in the sidebar.  On narrower screen widths it is a small truncated box below the video.  Also top comment is selected by default, so only one comment is going to show on page load.  This screws with full album track listings, requiring a click + reload on all videos to get a really small window to scrolling comments.",
