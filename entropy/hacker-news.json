      "text": "A recent post asked a question similar to &#x27;Am I going insane or is there no value in blockchain tech&#x27;. I have been thinking more about the idea that perhaps blockchain tech has reached maturity, and that we are instead waiting on the remainder of &#x27;Web3&#x27; to mature.<p>I may be oversimplifying, but if I look at Web3 as the existing internet, but without central intermediaries; then most applications can be built this way today. If we want a Clubhouse, or Zoom clone, these could be built atop existing WebRTC infrastructure. A Whatsapp clone can be built atop libp2p messaging (again I oversimplify). From the internet infrastructure view, the part that was missing has always been mechanisms of identity, ownership, and payment (trust mechanics in general). Today, blockchains handle these in a variety of formats, such that a project can just pick the chain that fits best with the application architecture. In &#x27;Web 2.0&#x27;, if I want auth, payments, file storage, etc - I would simply stitch together one or more infrastructure providers such as AWS. This feels very natural today.<p>Is it possible that blockchain has already reached maturity for the value it brings to the decentralized web? Are there any popular applications today that could not be built peer-2-peer in this context?<p>The big gap I still see in this view is who pays for services that are free in Web 2.0 (such as Facebook). But even in this case, blockchains provide a variety of incentive mechanics where increasing usage could appreciate a digital token, which in turn gives incentive for people to run the underlying infrastructures.<p>I also feel crazy in that there seems to be consensus that blockchain is suppose to do everything, or should be doing more than it does. In all of this, I am viewing the problem space from the domain of infrastructure, agnostic of application. Is blockchain tech already everything we need it to be?",
