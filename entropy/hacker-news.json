      "text": "Ever since my first visit to Japan I’ve been in love with the country and it’s people. I’m a brown guy, US citizen. My Japanese is not that good but if I can get a tutor I’m sure I can be proficient enough to work.<p>Beyond that I’m someone who respects and assimilates into my host country. I’m also good at full stack development and I’m looking at either engineering manager or co founder level roles.<p>How can someone like me find work in Japan? I don’t have any Japanese friends, and I don’t really know any cliche culture things like anime. I’m more into meditation and enjoying nature and what not.<p>Thanks!",
