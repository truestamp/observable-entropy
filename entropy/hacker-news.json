      "text": "Assume I am creating a webapp which can receive money from the users to their &quot;accounts&quot; in my system and send them out, something like a super simplified  version of a bank.<p>Are there any guides, practices to make it safe and properly? I see multiple ways of doing the same thing. For example, when a user puts in $10, then $3 then $7, then moves out $4, I can use a table in the database called balances and add or subtract a single number in the column - 0 + 10 + 3 + 7 - 4 = 16.<p>So, I keep in the column value of 16.<p>Another way is to add rows into a table called &quot;transactions&quot; and calculate the current balance every time I need it. In this case, if there are thousands of transaction for the user, I would need to calculate thousands of numbers every time I need to know balance.<p>I don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel so I would be happy to just have some guide of how these things are usually implemented even though I understand there is no such scenario as &quot;standard&quot; one and there are always myriads of small differences between different implementations.<p>In what direction should I look to understand how to build such a system in a better way and avoid mistakes?<p>Thanks!",
