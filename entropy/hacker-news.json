      "text": "We can all agree the state of password management on any platform isn&#x27;t ideal, but some are better than others. Textual passwords are needed for some use cases obviously, but at large this isn&#x27;t the case. With steganography or simple checksums alone I could easily see the possibilities that support the argument why images may be valid. Why would this not work in practice?",

I had an attorney write up a solid ToS but I&#x27;m concerned that some users may find a way to fake their traffic. I have a basic visit_log that shows me HTTP logs with IP and time_spent on page. I know easy it is to send fake bot traffic. My biggest fear is waking up and seeing I have to pay a user 6 digits for fake traffic.",
