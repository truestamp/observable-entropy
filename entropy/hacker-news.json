      "text": "I&#x27;ve been learning React with TypeScript on my Windows 10 desktop but I have some new needs: 1) To become more familiar with Linux and 2) My desktop doesn&#x27;t meet the Windows 11 requirements.<p>So my choice was to either try out WSL2 or get into Linux. I don&#x27;t play video games (which is why people usually stay on Windows) and I don&#x27;t use any commercial software that requires Windows (I&#x27;m not doing web design and the little I do I work with Figma or something similar).<p>I used to work in IT and yes I know I should&#x27;ve gotten into Linux earlier but my job involved Windows workstations and Windows servers. With that said, I don&#x27;t mind if I have to read documentation to get things working because that&#x27;s what developers do anyways.",
