      "text": "Apparently spammers figured out how to keep accounts and put links in upvoting comments. From Disqus:<p>&quot;Thanks for reaching out about this issue [comment up voting spam].<p>In early February 2022, Disqus released spam detection improvements that significantly limited the ability to generate comment spam. Spammers have since switched to a voting method in an attempt to bring attention to their user profiles and associated external links.\n At this time we advise commenters to not follow links from these spam profiles. Our team is working to take bulk action on the accounts involved in upvote spam, including removing these votes from discussion threads.\n On behalf of the team I apologize for the disruption to your community. I can assure you we are taking this new behavior seriously, and are committed to addressing spam in all forms across our network.&quot;",
