      "text": "I am an professional software developer, and have occasionally needed to work with dates and times, including applications that require a certain level of accuracy (e.g. processing pricing feeds from financial institutions)<p>Since 1970, there have been 27 leap seconds applied. But these don&#x27;t show up anywhere in any computer system I have ever used (OS, languages, applications, third party APIs). If I create a date object of 1970-01-01T00:00:00 and repeatedly add 86400 seconds, should I not end up with a date&#x2F;time that is no longer midnight?<p>I assume that we are collectively just ignoring leap seconds and hoping for the best. Is this OK?",
