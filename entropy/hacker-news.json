My thought process is much more abstract or word based, to the point of not truly being able to see anything but instead describing every detail with thought-words. I wondered if either approach was more popular among people that work with software or even across different types of work and whether people had had any success in learning to think the other way.<p>In short, do you think visually or in words and have you had any experience&#x2F;success in learning to think another way.",
