(The argument seems, as far as I have been able to discover, to be &quot;because how could it not be?&quot;)<p>My question is, is there any meaningful difference between a simulation and a video game? I can&#x27;t discern any. So when somebody says we are in a simulation, what I hear that we are all NPCs in somebody&#x27;s game.<p>Because, how could we not be?<p>To the Greeks, the world was the gods&#x27; playground. To (certain) Elizabethans, the world was a stage. To the Victorians, the universe was a clock. Every culture imagines the universe is whatever the hell they think they invented.<p>Are we NPCs?",
