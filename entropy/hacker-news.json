      "text": "There is a lot of information online about &quot;Cloud Engineers&quot; but that term is kind of reserved for people who build service using cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Cloudflare etc. Surprisingly, there is very little information about what people who built AWS, GCP, Cloudflare etc. actually do. I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that their daily routine is different from application-focused jobs, be it frontend OR backend. So-called &quot;Infrastructure Engineering&quot; also is synonymous with DevOps work which I believe is again different. While I understand there is a lot of work related to physical server maintenance, someone also writes software that allows deploys to any of the cloud&#x27;s services. What do you call such an engineer and what do they actually do? It would be nice to hear from people who work at the aforementioned companies or similar ones.",
