      "text": "EXAMPLE 1:<p>I customize and automate my workflow a lot. Basically I mod and tinker everything that I use to make it work differently and sometimes better. I write scripts that automate boring stuff, and Word VBA macros are my thing.<p>EXCEPT that nobody gives a $h!t about such skills. In my job, 99.9% of people just use what&#x27;s available and don&#x27;t bother changing things to make their workflow more convenient.<p>EXAMPLE 2:<p>Through practice and learning from the best speakers, I&#x27;ve improved my presentation skills over the years. From the moment I create a PowerPoint slide to the moment that I deliver the presentation. I create super advanced and professional slides and am confident when talking about my content in front of an audience.<p>EXCEPT that most people in my job (academia) don&#x27;t even notice all the hard work that goes into my presentations and all the details. Their slides are either simple Beamer Latex, or $h!tty PowerPoint slides using Calibri as the default font, not symmetric, no attention to aesthetics whatsoever. And their presentations are super boring and not at all engaging or exciting.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about where&#x2F;how I can put my skills in good use. I FEEL LIKE I&#x27;M NOT APPRECIATED for any of such skills.<p>PS: Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve used &quot;useless&quot; in the title, but by useless I mean not useful enough in your job to get you appreciated.",
