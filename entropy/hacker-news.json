      "text": "I came across a Twitter thread (linked in comments) which shows some interesting results when trying to recolor historical photos that have been decolored. The recolored photos are a lot drabber than the original (example in comments), and the thread author says that this gives us a skewed view of the past, making us think the past was a lot more boring than it was.<p>I thought of some related questions that I thought could be good for discussion here:<p>- Do you think that expert opinion should be consulted in the Machine Learning process more? If so, where? (perhaps omitting Expert Systems)<p>- Is there too much faith that a result from an ML model is the &quot;right&quot; result? (a phenomenon that maybe isn&#x27;t specific to ML but a result of human tendencies?)<p>- Do ML practitioners have a responsibility to clearly communicate to the general public the limitations and degree-of-confidence in these systems?<p>- Am I reading too much into this, and this colorization model is just a fun model to play with, and the conclusions of the Twitter thread are too speculative or conjectural?<p>- Is this colorization issue just another form of bias that needs to be ironed out?<p>- The thread concludes by saying that colorization should be left to experts who can use context to pick accurate colors. I think this is too extreme, and that ML systems can incorporate expertise when training, or after during evaluation. Do you think there are any jobs&#x2F;problems that ML methods could be applied to but should be left to experts (some considerations might be safety, privacy, ethics, etc.)<p>I know that ultimately a lot of these questions can simply boil down to statistics and their interpretation, so I&#x27;m not sure exactly where discussion could&#x2F;should&#x2F;will lead, but I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing your opinions!",
