Books on network programming discuss entry-level concepts for networking protocols but aren&#x27;t instructive about writing networked applications.  For instance, I don&#x27;t understand flow control mechanisms and how to use them effectively and I haven&#x27;t written my own custom binary protocols nor a message parser.  I think I&#x27;m looking for a syllabus for a network programming course that doesn&#x27;t exist, or I&#x27;m just not aware of.  Suggestions are welcome!",

A company that asks your current salary is asking to find out how little they can pay you. They are seeking to create and exploit a superior bargaining position that results from unequal knowledge - they know how much you make and how much they pay, but you only know one of those things. And that&#x27;s how they treat you <i>before</i> you start working there.<p>I doubt that companies who do this can be persuaded to stop.<p>But if I were a VC, it might give me pause to learn that a company in my portfolio does this. Knowing that the make or break comes down to people - or at least suspecting that might matter - might make me worry about a company that rejects valuing the one single resource that decides the whole ballgame.<p>Anywho, my nonsense aside, the object of the game is to see how many messages a recruiter will respond with before giving an actual compensation number. An unsolicited phone call counts as two messages. My current record is 7.",
