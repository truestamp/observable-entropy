I grew up writing code and this what puts me in the flow state and gives me joy.<p>Imagine the shock and devastation I&#x27;ve had when I&#x27;ve learned that code doesn&#x27;t really matter. The product is what&#x27;s important.<p>So. From an Engineer perspective - how&#x27;s code in your company? Is it readable? Maintainable? DX friendly? Or do you need to remember 7 different, cumbersome commands and edit 5 different files in order to locally debug your services?",

      "text": "Hey HN: Kaveh here, the founder of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usage.ai&#x2F;<p>We launched a new free tool to help engineers understand their AWS spend. Why? Because the way it&#x27;s done now is a pain. DevOps and Software Engineers end up end up becoming cloud accountants or end up forking over a big % of their AWS bill for a tool to understand costs rather than focusing on business problems.<p>Previous to founding Usage, I worked on high-performance computing research at JP Morgan Chase and as a software engineer at a number of smaller startups.<p>Here&#x27;s how this new tool works: It&#x27;s fully self-serve and free to use. You connect a limited-access IAM role (read-only + ability to manage RIs and SPs). You&#x27;ll see cost reduction recommendations on the Recommendations tab, your active and utilization status on the Plans tab, and the ability to splice-and-dice your data on the Instance Search page via Filters.<p>We make money off of a 20% Savings Fee. If you choose not to let Usage optimize your spend, you&#x27;ll never need to spend money on Usage.  Happy to chat directly kaveh@usage.ai<p>Have you experienced any issues with managing your company or organization&#x27;s AWS expenses? We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and ideas!<p>Blog post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.usage.ai&#x2F;new&#x2F;<p>Try free: www.usage.ai",
