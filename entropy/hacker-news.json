      "text": "Hey guys, \nI am going to finish my Bachelor in CS soon. Currently studying in Germany and was looking forward to get a master degree abroad.\nI know that this will look good on my CV and I can get to know another culture&#x2F;country and I really like that, but that is not my main reason. \nMy main reasons are to learn, expand my skills, network, but also find some friends for life.<p>For that reason I was looking into the University of the countires, which are considered to be the leading Cybernations (UK, US, Russia, China and Israel).<p>The US fees are way to expensive for me.<p>Do I need to explain why I dont want to go to Russia?<p>UK is a solid option imo.<p>I read a lot of different opinions about a master degree in China. Some say it&#x27;s awesome, some people say u actually don&#x27;t learn much, if u attend classes in english.\n(Of course I would learn the language, currently starting, but I don&#x27;t think I can get good enough in one year to attend classes in chinese)<p>Israel is a solid option too, but the lectures of they top Universities are in hebrew, unless a student, who studies abroad for a semester, is attending the class. So i would need to get good in hebrew asap or did I missread something on their website?<p>Any advice or proposal of an other country&#x2F;city would be greatly appreciated.",
