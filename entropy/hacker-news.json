I&#x27;ve read some articles about it and comparisons to Tesla&#x27;s Cybertruck (duh), but there was never any serious scale involved, more like a dozen seats sold. What would encourage you personally to invest like this? Is it lifetime access or money back guarantee? What is the max price that you&#x27;ll pay for MarTech tool on a presale terms?\nThank you for all of your feedback in advance! :)",

This is just for personal use, no actual monetary value.<p>But I haven’t been able to find much documentation on how to do this sort of thing, or links to sites or services that can make this happen.<p>Which also leads me to believe that maybe we could start up a business helping others to do this sort of thing?<p>Anyway, what sites or resources am I missing?",
