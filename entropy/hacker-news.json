      "text": "Hello HN Network - we&#x27;re in need of a new credit card for our 20 person hybrid (50% in person 50% remote) employee base. We&#x27;re a technology business selling a SaaS and IoT products.<p>Does anyone have recent experience they&#x27;d like to offer with Brex or all the alternatives out there? The space moves so quickly and I fear the marketing websites on these may not always line up with the reality of the card programs.<p>value drivers we&#x27;re interested in;<p><pre><code>  - ~2% or more cash back\n  - Web dashboard to manage employee cards and spending limits\n  - Web tools to make it easy for our accountants to reconcile statements with QBO\n  - &quot;Positive Pay&quot; or just completely single-use cards where the numbers can be generated online without much consequence.\n</code></pre>\nThanks in advance for any honest links or feedback.",
