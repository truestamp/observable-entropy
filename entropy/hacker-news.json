Nothing gets cut, we end up just moving everything over to the next sprint over and over until the features are complete. Sprint plannings are mostly a waste of everyone&#x27;s time as nothing valid happens beyond ticket assingment (except everyone already mostly knows what they should be working on)<p>The only super useful meetings we have is grooming where we talk through each ticket within each respective discipline.<p>I am looking into kanban which feels a lot more &quot;right&quot; to our workflow.
