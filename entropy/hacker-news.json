      "text": "I&#x27;m trying to convert shared pieces of code to a library, which could be re-used within our codebases (Hosted in Azure DevOps).<p>However, from looking into it, there is no way to share such libraries without incurring massive costs or sacrificing ease of use.<p>For example, You can use azure artefacts to pull python libraries, however, you now have to make sure all developers switch to using the new feed, as well as you&#x27;re forced into adding upstream of PyPI, which then leads to additional costs due to cached packages.<p>Another approach is to pull packages via ssh, but I assume that creates another mess with access permissions to said repositories as well.<p>How do you choose to deal with such problems in your environments?",
