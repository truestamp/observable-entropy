      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I with my team just launched LeaksID on Product Hunt: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;leaksid. LeaksID is an online converter that enriches documents with anti-leak invisible marks.<p>With LeaksID, you can be sure that all your private documents are protected.<p>How does it work?<p>- Upload your documents into the system\n- LeaksID will automatically add anti-leak marks (our marks are not watermarks! the main comparison is that our marks are invisible and you can&#x27;t remove them)\n- View, share and print your documents. Every time, you will get a unique enriched copy\n- If one of your documents is compromised, with LeaksID you will be able to find the leaker (even the name of a violator)<p>Interesting fact: LeaksID can create more than 2 trillion unique copies of one A4 document!<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback from the community. And if you have any questions about the marking technology, how LeaksID adds marks, how we investigate the leaker, feel free to ask.<p>Thank you!",
