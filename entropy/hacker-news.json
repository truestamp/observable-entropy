      "text": "I&#x27;m 31 and live in Maui. I feel like an imposter when I scroll through HN. I have never worked at a big tech company either. Just startups, small business, for myself as a contractor.<p>I come from generations of poverty and am still working out the fear and trauma I was steeped in as a boy.<p>I still love this planet and humanity, I can&#x27;t watch all this just happen without doing something.<p>I feel entrepreneurship is the most effective path to making a difference and creating wealth (for myself and for all involved).<p>I have notebooks full of designs for this one &#x27;crazy idea&#x27; that I feel could change the world. I lost sleep over it, I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else build this but I always hear people validating that the problem I am solving is a real one affecting billions of people.<p>I know there are at least a few people in this community who know the feeling of failing many times before succeeding. I would love to hear some stories, maybe some words of encouragement, things I should listen to&#x2F;read.<p>I sincereply appreciate anyone who read this, upvoted it, or replied. I don&#x27;t know where else to ask and get serious replies from people in our industry.<p>Mahalo :)",
