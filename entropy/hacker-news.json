      "text": "A couple of months back I got Covid for the first time and while I recovered physically in about 2 weeks , mentally I feel fatigued and depressed .\nI feel a sense of hopelessness and burnout and keep thinking about the death of my father early in the Covid days and a close friend who killed himself from depression after getting Covid. Through the last 2 years I have trudged along working from home , learning new things , developing a hobby for cooking and raising my kids while managing to not get Covid.\nHowever since getting it two months back , I have felt very depressed and can barely get out of bed and do any work. I am trying to understand if itâ€™s external factors like an oncoming recession fears or the going back to normal or if medically Covid does cause bad depression . If it does what might be the reasons for it?",
