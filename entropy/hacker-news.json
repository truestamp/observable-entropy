      "text": "Okay so, avocados are really expensive so you want them to be ripe and delicious when you buy them. So I want to build an Avocado Ripeness Detector but I need your help with it! Because to build this Ripeness Detector I need photos of avocados, both ripe and not-ripe.<p>And don&#x27;t tell me that you can just know it by pressing the top and if it&#x27;s soft it&#x27;s a good avocado. Even though that&#x27;s true most of the time, sometimes the avocados deceive you, those cunning bastards.<p>So if you have any avocados at home and are planning to eat them, please take several photos of that avocado in different angles with your phone and then open the avocado up to see if it&#x27;s good or not. Then send these photos to me at avocadophotos@aol.com with the information if it was ripe or not!<p>If I get enough photos to make a decent Avocado Ripeness Detector I will post the detector with the source code and all the data I got so other Avocado Lovers can use that data.<p>Thank you guys in advance!<p>the mail: avocadophotos@aol.com",
