      "text": "Hello HN! Could somebody explain to me why tailscale appears so frequently on the HN front page? I see posts from tailscale or about it every 2-3 days. I haven&#x27;t observed such behaviour with anything else.<p>Even if these posts are 100% legal (ie there&#x27;s no upvoting ring behind them) I still feel that the moderators should manually demote them from the front page because right now it feels like some form of cheap advertising trick.<p>Why not add a rule? Only one front page post about a product every month.<p>I&#x27;d really like to get some insights from the community and the moderation about that.<p>Thank you!",
