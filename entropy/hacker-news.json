      "text": "Hey HN,<p>just wanted to show my latest project called <i>tone</i> to get your feedback. It is a cross platform command line audio tagger. Currently in an early state of development it already comes with a neat set of features:<p>- read and write support for a decent amount of fields\n- supports id3, mp4, flac and most other formats\n- chapters, covers and even custom tag fields\n- install one single binary - no dependencies (M1 macOS does not work atm - maybe someone can help out here)<p>Source code and release download:<p>&lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sandreas&#x2F;tone&gt;<p>Feedback is really appreciated.<p>Thanks :-)",
