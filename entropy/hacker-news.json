I&#x27;m certain I could make more by switching jobs, but I wonder if I&#x27;m being screwed by more than the usual amount by staying.<p>I&#x27;m really effective in my current role. Past a certain level of seniority it&#x27;s a big ordeal to change jobs, rebuild your network within a new company, rebuild reputation and social capital, etc. These network effects are a big part of your effectiveness as a staff+ engineer.
