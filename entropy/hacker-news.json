Try it out at: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clujhunt.com&#x2F;ciphers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clujhunt.com&#x2F;ciphers</a><p>Hey, HN!<p>I&#x27;m Tudor and I&#x27;m working on a puzzle game where you solve increasingly difficult ciphers using a custom coded decryption tool that should make the process more enjoyable.\nAfter you solve each puzzle, you are rewarded with pieces of a story about a cryptography enthusiast, set in 1930s Germany.<p>The hardest part of this project was building the accompanying decryption tool. I wanted it to be mobile-friendly and it’s the part I iterated on the most, after receiving feedback from friends and early testers.<p>You can play the game here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clujhunt.com&#x2F;ciphers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clujhunt.com&#x2F;ciphers</a><p>For those who don’t feel like playing the game, I made a 2-minute video demo of the decryption tool: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vENHCt25P4M\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vENHCt25P4M</a><p>Disclaimer: There is a $5 paywall after you finish the second puzzle. I don&#x27;t expect to make money off it at this early stage. Instead, I use the paywall to measure what percentage of people are actually interested in this type of game.<p>Any feedback would be much appreciated and valuable, just leave a comment, I&#x27;ll be happy to chat . If you prefer email, my address is: sendtudor@gmail.com<p>Thanks :)\nTudor",
