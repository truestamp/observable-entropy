      "text": "Looking suggestions on shared hosts that support some level of automation for website&#x2F;database setup?<p>I currently use Dreamhost for several PHP sites. They&#x27;re fantastic, but they lack the ability to automate the setup of a website. Many of the websites that I set up have the same settings (e.g. include many common PHP scripts and HTML files, include a database, etc..). When I create a website, I need to do it manually through their web control panel. I would like the ability to either create a &quot;template&quot; site that I can copy and use as a starting point, or be able to create a website via an API (so I can do the bootstrapping myself).<p>I also have several EC2, Linode, Cloudsail, and dedicated servers elsewhere, but I value the fully managed, &quot;shared-hosting&quot; experience that Dreamhost provides for simpler sites that don&#x27;t need a full node.",
