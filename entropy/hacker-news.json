      "text": "I recently signed up for a new credit card and checking account as well as updating some information on old accounts and I&#x27;ve been getting a set of prompts (both over the phone when talking w&#x2F; customer service reps and online) from multiple different institutions that look like:<p>- Which of these cities has xyz family member lived or owned property in?<p>- Which of these universities have you attended in the past?<p>- Which of these cars have you been associated with in the past?<p>This isn&#x27;t information that I&#x27;ve ever provided to any of these institutions, and the questions are all framed&#x2F;styled similarly, so I&#x27;m assuming that there&#x27;s some new third party security question provider in town. I&#x27;m very curious who they are, if they&#x27;re mining data themselves or just buying it, and how they&#x27;ve become so seemingly prevalent so fast.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten extremely disillusioned about the privacy of my data recently, especially after finding out that my employer and many others are reporting my salary data to Equifax behind my back [1]. It&#x27;s somewhat disappointing to see that we&#x27;ve reached the point where it&#x27;s become socially acceptable for companies to know information about you that you&#x27;ve never given them. I feel like just a few years ago something like this would have resulted in public backlash, but no one seems to care at all anymore.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29834753",
