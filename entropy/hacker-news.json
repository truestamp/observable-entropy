      "text": "We are in the MVP phase, and our team is debating how &quot;cloud-native&quot; our initial launch should be.<p>There are some things on the data ingestion side and warehousing that we&#x27;ve been doing on our own server and we&#x27;re deciding whether to build into AWS or just forklift it later on.<p>Without getting into specifics, my question would be how important you think it is to optimize for AWS early on. I&#x27;m of the view that if a product is &quot;born in the cloud&quot; it will pay dividends down the line. I&#x27;ve seen things that need to be Retrofitted to the cloud later and it can be a disaster.<p>Keep in mind we are in the MVP phase, so naturally we are very limited on engineering resources and would like to reduce the amount of time spent on DevOps &#x2F; infrastructure stuff.<p>Would appreciate feedback on this. Thank you HN",
