      "text": "I dropped out of my math PhD program at the start of 2021 and have spent the last few months learning statistics and how to program. I have always enjoyed competitive math so I really loved leetcode&#x2F;Project Euler and have done a few hundred problems between them. But I have no real programming experience.<p>During my undergrad summers I did &quot;REU&#x27;s&quot; (essentially math internships) and I went to grad school directly after graduating, so I have no experience in anything but pure math. I fear the longer I stay unemployed the less attractive I would be to an employer.<p>I was wondering: \n1) What type of jobs (in tech) may be welcoming to someone with my skillset? (that is which can I apply to without learning too much more at this point).\n2) If there is generally more I should know before I can apply to most jobs?\n3) I have not yet applied to any jobs but I was wondering if I should click &quot;new grad&quot; or &quot;professional&quot; since I am neither.<p>Currently I am thinking of SWE jobs, but I am happy to learn of any other suggestions.<p>Cheers,\nn-Dim.",
