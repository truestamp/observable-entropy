      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a paying Heroku customer for a decade, with multiple businesses (a surf company, tennis reservation system) and personal projects hosted without issue.<p>On Tuesday, I woke up to sites down and my login not working. No emails from Heroku. After emailing support, I got an automated response that I&#x27;d been banned for violations of the Acceptable Use Policy. No details, just instantly dropped.<p>I&#x27;ve sent 10s of emails to every Heroku and Salesforce support and security department, called the SF offices, and tried social media. I still have no idea why my account was suspended, and apparently I have no recourse to get my company data back (backups, credentials...everything is through the Heroku login).<p>Heroku is trying to put me out of business, I recommend you leave them before they do the same to you!",
