      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using LinkedIn almost since Day 1 and I&#x27;m not sure why. I had ~10,000 e-mails from headhunters, only about 150 of which were somewhat relevant, of that 1 resulted in directly putting any money in my pocket.<p>In my connections I had ~6,000 connections, and about 150 of them I had worked with, 50-60 would pass the beer test, and maybe 25 I would recognize.<p>Meanwhile LinkedIn has pretty much become a business-oriented spammy Facebook, so I deleted my account.<p>Is GitHub the best place to show off my skills &#x2F; hold a resume, or are there any other worthy alternatives which haven&#x27;t just become Facebook clones?",
