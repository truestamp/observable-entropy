      "text": "My Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs are about 3 years old now, and the battery is starting to get rubbish. I get about an hour if using noise-cancelling and the microphone, 3 hours for audio only.<p>I contacted Bose to ask if they service them, but the answer is no. They offered a replacement I could buy (with a discount, but still more expensive than most places are selling them anyway).<p>But I really object to buying a new set of headphones when these ones just need a new battery.<p>Has anyone tried replacing the battery? I&#x27;ve seen a few videos, but it seems quite difficult. Since I can still use them with a cable, I&#x27;m worried about destroying them entirely.",
