      "text": "Is it within a company’s rights to sell a non-consumable product, let’s say “Access all of software for X cost”, then within a year or two, turn around and say “Access all of software for X cost with subscription but folks who purchased all software before without subscription now lose access”?<p>Based off my little knowledge of software licensing, that seems like it’s legal and allowable. So, a company can give a sale to allow access to software with a single purchase, then randomly revoke access and then request you to pay again to access the same stuff you previously thought you bought and had access to?",
