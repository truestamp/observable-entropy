      "text": "I have been the owner of a facebook page [0], which I created more than 10 years ago, and has built into a nice community (focused around heavy metal) in that time. It is the sister page of the website https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metalised.wordpress.com&#x2F;. The biggest feature of this site and facebook page are the end-of-year metal reviews, which have been very popular, and have been often re-shared on facebook by the featured bands with a lot of gratitude.<p>Recently, someone hacked the page somehow, and managed to make themselves the owner of the page. They also created a business account, and gave it full admin access.<p>For some reason they either couldn&#x27;t or simply didn&#x27;t kick me out completely before updating my passwords, and I still have some editing&#x2F;posting privileges, but I cannot kick out the new owner or admin, and I have no idea what they&#x27;re going to do with this power. As far as I know, they can delete the page, or start spamming&#x2F;scamming my community any moment now.<p>I have been going through facebook&#x27;s official pages and reporting processes for about a month now, but there has been zero response, and facebook makes it impossible to talk to a human. Furthermore, the &quot;I&#x27;ve been hacked&quot; page [1] only deals with personal accounts, not pages; there is no option on recovering ownership of stolen pages. In fact, their only suggested solution, here [2], seems to be &quot;Ask the new owner to give you back access&quot;. Are they serious???<p>Has anyone here had any similar experiences and a solution to this problem? I saw someone here the other day suggest &quot;buying an Oculus&quot; in order to get help with a personal account, but I don&#x27;t see that working for page ownership, since my account is technically fine. I find it very difficult to believe that a community of 57k metalheads can disappear in an instant like this (or worse, be used for scams) and there&#x27;s not a single person at Facebook I can email about it!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;metalised.net&#x2F;\n[1] facebook.com&#x2F;hacked\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;738660629556925",
