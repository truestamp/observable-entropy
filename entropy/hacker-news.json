Primarily I did this project to improve my skills and I was wondering if there is something I could improve. So far it features:<p>- Filters to search by tags, location, visa sponsorship, remote, etc.<p>- Companies can post job offers with a description, tech stack as well as benefits (work from home, pet friendly office, Friday beers, etc).<p>- Developers can create profiles (add a small bio and upload their skills) so companies can find them, too.<p>- If logged-in, you can filter by recommendations.<p>- Dark mode.<p>Very much looking forward!",
