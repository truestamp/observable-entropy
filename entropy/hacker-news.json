      "text": "I&#x27;m interviewing for the first time in a long time.<p>I&#x27;m a 10+ year systems&#x2F;networking&#x2F;DevOps eng.  I&#x27;ve seen some shit.  I&#x27;ve interviewed over 400 people for a FAANG company.<p>In my current round of interviews, I&#x27;ve been asked hardly any questions of substance.  No situational &#x27;how would you solve this?&#x27; type questions.  There&#x27;s some basic questions, a coding interview, and then they want to send me home with homework.  It feels like a red flag to me.  As if the company is fine with pushing off their incompetence into my free time.  Every one of these I&#x27;ve gotten, I think, &#x27;You could have spent 35 minutes walking through a similar problem with me to see if I&#x27;m in the right path to solve the issues you have in your day to day.  So far, I&#x27;ve just dropped any company that assigns homework.  I&#x27;m not applying for a Sr. level role, just wanna make widgets and like most of us in this industry, I just read a book and then pull up the docs of the stack I&#x27;m working with and figure it out.<p>It&#x27;s been so frequent in this recent job search that I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s just the way things are done now or if it&#x27;s a real red flag that says the company won&#x27;t respect my time or competency.<p>What gives?  Have things changed?  Am I out of touch?  Is that a red flag or just the way we do things now?",
