      "text": "I&#x27;m thinking about how to manage best practice consent with web analytics. This is specifically for sites without hardcore data-driven conversion optimisation, etc., where absolute accuracy is not crucial.<p>My assumptions are that:<p>- client-side will under report, because  users opt out or block JS and cookies<p>- server-side will over report, because of bots, crawlers, etc.<p>I was thinking that combining both in a dashboard can give clients a sense that the reality will be somewhere in the middle. Obviously there&#x27;s a limit to how many metrics can be measured by both systems to enable this comparison, but I&#x27;m thinking the basics should be possible. Are my assumptions about over- and under-reporting right?<p>Does anyone do anything like this and how do you do it?<p>And are there any metrics that help us understand how much traffic is being missed by, for example, Google Analytics these days? Many clients still assume that it gives a 100% gospel representation.",
