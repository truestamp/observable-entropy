There, I said it.<p>I&#x27;ve always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let&#x27;s me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.<p>I understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I&#x27;ve gather after a few days, I don&#x27;t understand it.<p>Instead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don&#x27;t want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.<p>Ok, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn&#x27;t that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?<p>I must be missing something, right?",
