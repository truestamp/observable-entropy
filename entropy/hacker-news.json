Hint: this is WAY more likely among candidates who aren’t 20-30 year old, English speaking white guys.<p>Even better, drop the range and give a clear, fixed salary for a specific role, no negotiation allowed.<p>It should be obvious that this is a small part of a big problem, but it’s a quick and easy one to fix and has a serious impact.",
