      "text": "This is a bit of a broad question, but I&#x27;ve run into it several times, so I&#x27;m curious how other HNers handle it.<p>The scenario is pretty simple:<p>You&#x27;re using some mainstream service, let&#x27;s say Facebook, Discord, Tinder, Gmail, PayPal, Amazon, etc. You&#x27;re using it not by personal choice, because if you had a choice, being the HN reader you are, you&#x27;d probably use an open source and self hosted option. Rather, you&#x27;re using it because you want to participate in mainstream society and engage with people on the platforms where they are.<p>To the best of your knowledge, you&#x27;re sticking to the services&#x27; TOS and Code of Conduct. Maybe you&#x27;re thinking outside the box a bit, because again, you are an HN reader, but for the most part you&#x27;re a well behaved user acting in good faith.<p>Then one day it happens, you upload a photo, or withdraw some money, or join a server, or send a message, and suddenly, with no warning, you&#x27;re locked out of your account. You get a message saying you&#x27;ve violated the terms of service and your account has been deactivated. There is no explanation, and no chance for appeal. You&#x27;re locked out from doing whatever it was you were doing that you depended on the service for.<p>So, what do you do? Are there effective ways to get a response, or file an appeal, with these companies? Talking to many of their support teams is like talking to a brick wall. Are there secret ways to get through to someone with the ability to help? Are there legal actions you can take? Does publicly complaining about the issue with a blog post or on Twitter help, or is it a waste of time? Is it better to just cut your loses and move on? Stop dealing with the company altogether?",
