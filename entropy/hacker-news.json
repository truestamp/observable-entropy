      "text": "I studied CS in college and for a few years I had this project of building an app to crawl and visualize the intellectual web (starting small with the Twitter API for example; and asking feedback on programming help Discord servers for quick reply). However, I never managed to keep consistency in the development of the app, despite of being mostly committed (I don&#x27;t have many responsabilities or priorities).<p>I feel like I have a disease to focus at this point, but I also feel like most developers can&#x27;t ship a useful solo project and it recomforts me.<p>I only manage to focus in the evening or when I have somebody to talk with about the app or when somebody on a forum can help me to fix a bug.<p>So when you are blocked because the side project path is not clear, what do you do?",

In Netflix&#x27;s case, their documentaries are shitty too.<p>Are there any video services worth subscribing to? Both educational and entertainment? I did some googling, found these so far - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wondrium.com&#x2F;, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curiositystream.com&#x2F;. They seem good, though I am yet to try.<p>Any more? Any diamond in the rough? I am aware of some YouTube channels, but I prefer sites like the two above. Especially indie, smaller teams that I can support, however tiny amount my money is.",
