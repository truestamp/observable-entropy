      "text": "From a layperson, outside ignorant perspective, FB seems to be in a difficult place. For quite some time now, the sentiment I’ve seen among “people in the know” is that there are fundamental issues at facebook that are not being addressed, and having watched all of todays testimonial, a few things stand out as real issues. FB itself understands:<p>The ML used to protect users on FB is only localized into 20 or so languages, not all the languages supported by FB.<p>In the context of rabbit holeing, the ML used to protect users and the ML used to make money are at odds with each other, so the ML used to make money is weighted more heavily.<p>When issues of the potential for creating a civil war in various regions across the world due to misinformation amplified by the first two issues, the CEO opted not to change course.<p>A non-statistically insignificant number of teenagers attribute strong urges towards suicide due to an inability to protect them.<p>In theory this all seems net negative, and so\nI ask this without value judgement, but out of genuine curiosity, why are you choosing to continue working on this product?",
