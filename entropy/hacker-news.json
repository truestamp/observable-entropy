I hope this email still reaches Dan.<p>I&#x27;m trying to reach a user that went by the handle &quot;makaronin&quot; in 2015-2018 on Hacker News (and elsewhere around the web).<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=makaronin<p>This user bought several tiles in Etheria (the first NFT project on Ethereum) which are <i>now worth several million USD</i>, but I can&#x27;t reach them bc I don&#x27;t have their email address and they&#x27;ve deleted their Reddit account.<p>You can see that they purchased the tiles here:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3qecog&#x2F;comment&#x2F;cweqc7n<p>I don&#x27;t need their email directly. A simple email from you, to them, saying &quot;Hi. Did you buy Etheria tiles in 2015? You might want to look into that, if so. If not, please disregard&quot; would suffice. etheria.world is the official site.<p>I&#x27;d love for this person to find out they&#x27;re worth millions (if they weren&#x27;t already). Can you assist?<p>Cyrus<p>p.s. Further evidence (linux knowledge, forum postings, etc): \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.lenovo.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;viewprofilepage&#x2F;user-id&#x2F;1029113<p>-------------<p>ADDITIONAL NOTE: There are several other &quot;cold&quot; accounts that have Etheria tiles, including a tile containing the first tradable UGC artwork ever put on any blockchain (the cabin on tile 16,5). Additionally these early buyers tended to buy &quot;rare&quot; tiles (islands, ice, mountains, etc) that are possibly worth 10x &quot;normal&#x2F;floor&quot; tiles.<p>To see the cold tiles and accounts, go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;etheria.world&#x2F;exchange.html and click &quot;recency&quot;.<p>My email is cyrus at the official domain above.",
