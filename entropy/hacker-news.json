      "text": "hi all, i have developed this site with practice questions for a few certifications. Some questions are drafted by me and some submitted by users.\nfor some premium questions there&#x27;s a small fee that gives you access for a few months. \ni am starving for ideas on how to promote the site and increase it&#x27;s reach. The content is good (i believe), i also have heard some good reviews from people saying that the practice questions helped them succeed in the exam.\nAny ideas are welcome.. also if anybody wants to get involved to help&#x2F;grow the site, please reach out to me.",

Both reading articles or listening via text to speech when on the go.<p>I use Pocket currently to save articles and listen but it doesn&#x27;t have the ability to order the queue.<p>My problem is I always jump around just reading the latest things I saved or come across rather than building myself a stricter curriculum and sticking to getting through it in a logical order.<p>Does anyone else do something like this to structure your personal study and how do you do it?<p>Cheers!",
