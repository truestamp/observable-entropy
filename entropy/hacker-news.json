I know Google&#x27;s firebase is a viable option, and hacker news database can be accessed through API call, but I am more interested in self hosted solution. While exploring for possible options, I found strapi and Parse. Which one is more suitable for this project? Which are the differences that I need to consider while choosing the right backend framework for a project?<p>Please point me to the right direction. Thanks in advance. :)",
