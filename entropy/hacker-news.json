      "text": "My company has grown a lot in the last few years and the IT org has added a lot of processes and procedures. Some kind of make sense to me, others don&#x27;t. My manager is new to the company and is one of the people pushing for all the new processes. I&#x27;ve advocated against a few  policies with some success, but I feel like I&#x27;m just delaying them by six months. Does anyone have any stories, tips, books, or advice on how to handle situations like this? I can&#x27;t decide if I should be even louder advocating against all the changes or just go around the policies and do whatever I think is best or just give up and go along with it.",
