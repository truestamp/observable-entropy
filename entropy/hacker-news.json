      "text": "YouTube TV is currently implementing a sleazy dark pattern to try to trick you to upgrade to 4K (an additional $20 per month after promotional period expires). Here is how they are doing it. If you follow the Warriors you can direct TYTV to automatically record all their games. Well, for todays game, which is being broadcast on the NBATV channel (which is included in YTTV) the auto recording has been disabled.  The game on NBATV has been renamed to Center Court, which doesn’t appear on the Warriors feed or the NBA feed. Instead, on these feeds YTTV is helpfully (sarcasm) advertising that you can upgrade to 4K, which will allow you to record the game. I almost signed up for the free trial just so I could record this game before I realized it was actually being shown in non 4K on the normal non 4K NBATV channel. By disabling recording for this game they are just trying to trick you into signing up for 4K. I know that Google&#x2F;YouTube employees read this board. Please tell you bosses this. The American consumer is tired of this underhanded dishonest conduct. Knock these dark patterns off.",
