Notifications on the phone indicate permissions removed for apps not used for a few months.<p>For example, \nX App - Location permission was removed.  Microphone and Camera permissions removed, etc., etc.,<p>This is also provides for proactive care by the user to remove any apps no longer used.<p>As a macbook user, I was curious to know if something similar exists on macbook&#x2F;iOS to check on &quot;every&quot; app permission?<p>Also, is there a way on both systems and control via whitelist, blacklist particular sys calls on a per app basis?",
