      "text": "I work as a Mid Product Designer for a big company ($8+ billions) in London (UX&#x2F;UI, not Industrial design). My salary is currently £45k, which I now realise it&#x27;s too low. It&#x27;s a temp contract for now though. This contract will last until the end of this year and then they want to convert it to perm.<p>My manager etc. already agreed that I should go perm, so right now it&#x27;s just a matter of bureaucracy and I&#x27;m waiting for an official offer.<p>I think I should definitely ask for a raise when that time comes. I&#x27;m now fully integrated with how the team works. I handle big projects that are extremely profitable for the company. Everyone likes me. And if they had to find someone else, it&#x27;d require them a lot of money and resources to do that. One of our senior designers told me it was a nightmare last time around, because they couldn&#x27;t find anyone good, so he thinks I&#x27;ve a lot of leverage at this point.<p>Also, my skills are now very different compared to when I accepted my previous contract many months ago. I improved a lot and I&#x27;m worth more.<p>My idea is to lay down the things I&#x27;m bringing to this company, and then say something like &quot;...because of this, I&#x27;d like to have a competitive market rate. Mid Product Designers in London earn £58-60k. I&#x27;m flexible and willing to find some common ground&quot;.<p>Any advice on this? Did any of you negotiate their salary when going from temp to perm? (I&#x27;m not a contractor, I&#x27;ve a normal temp contract and I&#x27;ve a yearly salary)",
