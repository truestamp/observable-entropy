None of us are interested in managing anything non engineering-related. Where do you usually find the manager types for your startup?  You know, the ones who can talk to investors, do the government paperwork, and other boring stuff.",

      "text": "Karambol is an AI-powered travel guide. It works like a search engine and aims to provide relevant travel itineraries while matching one&#x27;s travel preferences.<p>As a traveler, I&#x27;m quite frustrated by paper guides. Way too long to read! Plus, I feel the editors add new “must see” things every year just to justify the new edition (and the price). I&#x27;m also frustrated at travel blogs where storytelling is over-used.<p>I like having the “best of the best” places to visit and have help building my itinerary. I know many others do the same. This is why I started Karambol, which is a side project so far.<p>Any feedbacks are welcomed!",
