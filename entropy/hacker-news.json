      "text": "There are cars out there that are very old but well maintained. They go for more money then they were originally worth and are often still fairly capable vehicles. I’m wondering if we might eventually see a similar situation with microprocessors. Obviously there are many factors that play into this, but I’m amazed that I can currently sell my gtx 1080 ti that I custom cooled for more than I bought it. Part of me is sad to see it go because it still can handle a huge workload and it looks sweet. Will I one day look back and see my card on the market for 5 figures? Will any generation ever look back and see their old chips on the market for 5 figures?",
