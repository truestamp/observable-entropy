      "text": "I just had a big uncanny valley experience when I stumbled onto a jovial Australian hacker introducing an apparently computer generated animation of a StackExchange Question&#x2F;Answer I just read...<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serverfault.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;854426&#x2F;how-to-override-smtp-host-details-while-using-sendmail<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=siKs98nwxWY<p>I grow accustomed to stackoverflow based doppelganger sites but this was for me a new level of scam. Bitcoin consume a lot of energy, but at least you can believe that it might ultimately end up being usable in some way. This look like a pure waste of resource to generate and store automated video content that is actually LESS accessible than the original in order to mine a few buck.<p>Do you think it&#x27;s ethical or are you internally screaming as I am right now?",
