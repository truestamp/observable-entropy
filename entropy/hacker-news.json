      "text": "End-to-end testing in software engineering is something really useful, when accompanied with tons of unit and integration tests. But is it that helpful when it comes to systems and networks?<p>Context: My company has a complex system of proxies interconnecting to other companies in other cloud environments. We were lately discussing about end-to-end testing. (e.g from our company A in cluster A in cloud A, to external company B cluster B in cloud B. Just uni-directional, because we would not even like to extract the monitoring from company B into cloud A, whatever they have set).<p>The most senior engineer was against end-to-end testing, while the rest were in favor of it. Of course we are having tons of monitoring on http status codes, latency, etc. So to say, &quot;unit tests&quot;, as in the software engineering counterpart.<p>Why was he saying so? Because for sure we would be &quot;pinging&quot;(or whatever kind of ping is it) to another &quot;demo&quot; service at the other end, which in the end it is not part of a production environment, and the production environment may change, leaving this demo service unattended and prone to errors. \nAnd I understand that we would not like to affect production traffic by &quot;pinging&quot; production services.<p>He is arguing that with sufficient &quot;unit&quot; tests we can disclose an issue better than with the unreliable end-to-end tests. Other colleague argued that with end-to-end tests we can check everything in case we forgot to monitor some part of it. The system has several series of reverse proxies, backends and load balancers in a rather complex way with HTTPS in every step so I also understand that.<p>So what would your take be here in this situation? I believe in the SRE books from Google something was suggested in similar scenarios, but I can not find it.",
