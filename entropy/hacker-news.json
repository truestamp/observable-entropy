      "text": "I heard the greatest little self-help trick the other day. You&#x27;ve\nprobably been doing this for years or it comes naturally to you. The\nidea is to think of taming a wild horse and how at first the horse\ndoesn&#x27;t trust you and it might not go in the direction you want to go.\nBut you go along for the ride, petting the horse, letting it decide\nwhere to go and being happy with any direction. With tons of patience\nyou keep at this for a long time until finally the horse has bonded\nwith you. He trusts you, and you can for the first time, carefully,\ngently, suggest he turn left or right. If you pull left or right too\nviolently or suddenly, you&#x27;ll spook the horse, lose his trust, and be\nback to having no control. So you have to make very gentle left or\nright suggestions. Over time you get better and better at it and at\nsome point you really can say you&#x27;ve &quot;tamed&quot; it and getting the horse\nto take you to your correct destination is no problem at all.<p>The horse is a metaphor for life and becoming a master at getting your\nlife to go the direction you want is the same process. But the way you\nslowly bond with life is to let life take you any direction it wants\nat first. The way you express you are okay with this is to be grateful\nfor anything life throws at you.  The way you &quot;spook the horse&quot; and\nhave to start all over again is to try and pick the direction too\nsoon. You have to bank tons and tons of gratitude for all sorts of\nlittle things before life will let you take the reins and suggest a\nnew course.<p>The challenge is to 180 your thinking when you are unhappy with any\nsituation and look for the good. Sometimes you have to resort to stuff\nlike &quot;well, I&#x27;m grateful there was hot water in the shower today.&quot; or\nother stuff we often take for granted. But over and over you don&#x27;t let\nyourself get down or depressed, you keep looking for ways to say\n&quot;thanks life! I&#x27;m super grateful for today&#x27;s direction!&quot; And just like\nwith the horse you have to be patient, only once you have enough\ngratitude banked do you dare suggest life go the way YOU want.<p>from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=X64vpuY-Npg",
