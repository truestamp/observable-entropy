I have been taking medication and ERP therapy for last more than a year. Although my compulsions have come down a lot after undergoing intense ERP, the underlying fear never really got treated and I still don&#x27;t quite enjoy life as a normal person. I have hesitation in doing simplest of things and often indulge in avoidance behaviours. I would be grateful if some of you can share some advice or experiences.",
