I&#x27;m three companies deep and have decided I don&#x27;t have another one in me at this point. I&#x27;m not interested in taking a CEO position elsewhere or pursuing the more &quot;standard&quot; path of becoming an investor.<p>My strength&#x2F;passion is in identifying a need and building things people like. Not so much running the company once the thing exists and has been properly brought to market.<p>Are there roles inside larger organizations that cater to this skillset? Consulting is a pretty obvious path but I&#x27;m hoping there might be some out-of-the-box ideas from anyone who has made a similar transition.",
