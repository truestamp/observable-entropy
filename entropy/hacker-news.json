      "text": "From my experience with the Software Center on Ubuntu, I have encountered many issues which I will outline here. Why is the Snap software center so buggy? I&#x27;m on version 18 of Ubuntu because version 20 of Ubuntu is incompatible with my laptop and crashes randomly, but the version 18 store should be smooth and non-buggy despite its legacy status. What&#x27;s going on?<p>- Most software is stuck on an older version and lags behind the latest release.<p>- Sometimes software hangs when installing. Gets stuck on 95% and stays that way, with no way to get it fully installed.<p>- Some of the comments on software are un-moderated and you read people trying to push a political agenda saying things like &#x27;This software is Marxist because it&#x27;s free&#x27;<p>- The Software Center is buggy as hell and constant error messages popup when trying to install software. (Yes I&#x27;ve done the update&#x2F;upgrade ritual before installing anything).<p>- Most software is lacking screenshots. I like to see what the UI looks like before I install.<p>- I often encounter the software I want flashing for three seconds on the screen, and then disappearing for no reason. The search functionality is broken.<p>- I sometimes see duplicate software packages, with one less popular version that has 1 star, and another with 4&#x2F;5 stars (guess which one I download and install?)",

      "text": "I want backups for all data entering my system at the HTTP level. It happens fairly often in my career that the worst data loss bugs happen in ways where you&#x27;re not covered by backups. The data doesn&#x27;t get saved, validation goes amok, it gets saved them gets deleted. In all these cases having backups of the data as it enters the system would enable recovery of it.<p>Are there tools like this? It&#x27;s not enough to just save it, it would need to be searchable as well. The data may be sensitive so it would need to be encrypted too.",
