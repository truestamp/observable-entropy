      "text": "Hello, I work as a senior engineer at company, where I&#x27;m objectively doing good.<p>I&#x27;ve recently got a new offer from another company for the same role but with a 40% increase in salary.\nWhen discussing with my current employer, they said they would really like to keep me but to kind of match that offer they need to give me a promotion too (as tech lead) but I don&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s natural for me at my current level to take that kind of job for the moment (I have 4 years experience total) especially since my team will only consist of one person (more to be recruited in the next 2 years), and it&#x27;s the person that I get along with the least in the team.<p>what&#x27;s the possible career path in this case ? get the best title whenever possible ? get the job with the best salary for less responsibility ? My goal is to make tye best decision that will help move further in my career.",
