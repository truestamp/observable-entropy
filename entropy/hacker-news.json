      "text": "I&#x27;m looking to start a little hobby work on an idea I have, and want to build an application that has the potential of being cross platform.<p>I am very experienced with React, have shipped applications using Swift&#x2F;Obj-C on the app store.  I want to build something that has the potential to be fast on multiple (particularly full OS) platforms (mainly so I can throw this work to my various friends to dogfood).<p>Fun is probably more important than cross platform.  I want to enjoy myself.<p>What would you recommend around UI toolkits nowadays?  The options I&#x27;m thinking about currently are:<p>1. Common code in Rust or something, UI code in native platforms.\n2. React Native for Windows&#x2F;Mac.\n3. Revery (ReasonML&#x2F;OCaml UI library built for onivim): I&#x27;ve been wanting to play with this for a while, only downside is they don&#x27;t support M1 natively yet, and an M1 computer is my daily driver.<p>The downside of JavaScript projects like in (2) is that I deal with those daily for my main work, and I hate package managers, cross compiling, babel, etc etc, they vastly reduce the fun.",
