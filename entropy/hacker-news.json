      "text": "The threads about FIDO and GitHub requiring 2FA have shown that many people are concerned about various issues with hardware keys. Examples of the concerns are: lack of convenient backup, cloud backup, privacy, centralization,  future readiness (if the hardware&#x27;s support is discontinued), not being open source.<p>A solution to this would be to emulate the 2FA hardware in software running on the same machine as you&#x27;re using to log in - so it is not 2FA anymore but 1FA.<p>It would be at the cost of security, but at the benefit of allowing users to keep doing as they&#x27;ve been with regular passwords.<p>So what software solutions exist for emulating things like FIDO, WebAuthN, YubiKeys, etc.?",
