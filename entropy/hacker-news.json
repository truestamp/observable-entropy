      "text": "I saw a job posting for Compound and browsed their site. But I still have questions. Maybe someone here knows.<p>They say they&#x27;re targeting employees of startups. Is this really a big enough market to support the company? Is there really no other company that can handle financial advice for startup employees? I don&#x27;t think it would be that difficult for someone with a CFA to handle, and should be 90% the same as a &quot;normal&quot; employee. What am I missing?<p>They mention they&#x27;re different than traditional advisors or robo advisors. I didn&#x27;t see mention of what they actually are though. Also, I think I saw an article that Vanguard has started low cost personalized advice. How does this compare to that?",
