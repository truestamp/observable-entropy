Install Posts<p>B: Sequence these tasks out on a timeline&#x2F;calendar, where the order of the tasks are preserved.<p>C: Reschedule&#x2F;Adjust the sequence of tasks on the calendar but keep the relationships between them preserved. IE: if you move task 1. From Monday -&gt; Tuesday, then tasks 2, 3 also are moved to later in the week such that the overall structure of time is preserved.<p>Basically, what I want is a calendar where tasks can be &#x27;connected&#x27; to each other so when you move one the rest adjust as well.<p>Things that are close:<p>Nested Gannt Charts.\n - Haven&#x27;t yet found an editor for these that has the ease of use of a regular calendar, but the visual representation is really close conceptually.<p>Epics &amp; Tasks. (Agile)\n -This concept is pretty close as well, but I haven&#x27;t found a project planning tool that represents these as ordered over time on a calendar. Also, most project management tools have 100 other features that I don&#x27;t really need and are clunky.",
