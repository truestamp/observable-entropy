I like learning new things, and testing them out in an interactive environment, without bothering to deploy at some point. I might write 20 different versions of a Method, just to discard it in the end. In my mind, this is not wasted time, but my Employer might think differently. I want to impress him with my skills, but can&#x27;t bring myself to produce anything usable.\nAt its core, it is Escapism. How do I get my Head out of my Ass and start producing?",
