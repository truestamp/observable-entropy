      "text": "Hey everyone. So this is not exactly a question that would normally go on HN, but I casting a pretty wide net for feedback.<p>I am slowly learning that the &#x27;tuition reimbursement&#x27; benefit is very, very conditional. In the case of my current company, its mostly dependent on my boss&#x27;s boss. Still, I would think given today&#x27;s environment, companies would do anything to keep people tethered.<p>I personally think I am making a decent business need case for it, but, as my boss put it, no one here but CCO has one.<p>I am having no problem getting my certs reimbursed and whatnot, but this appears to be a bridge too far.<p>Am I doing something wrong? Am I not presenting myself and benefit to the company well enough? Should I just brown nose my boss&#x27;s boss?<p>It is not a small company and it actually benefited financially from COVID. My performance has only gotten better in COVID times and I am about to successfully complete a bigger project.<p>Any thoughts, suggestions, comments are welcome.",
