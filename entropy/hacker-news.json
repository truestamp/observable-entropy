      "text": "I&#x27;m working on a company in my spare time. I think it&#x27;s going to take at least 6 months to a year to escape my corporate job and work on it full-time. At the same time I&#x27;ve been offered a position with higher pay but much higher responsibility, social pressure and time pressure at my current company. If my long-term goal is to leave and start my own company, should I take the new role and extra $20K per year or should I stay in my less demanding role and spend that extra time on my company? My savings are ~$7K so the $20K would be significant in helping pay living expenses while transitioning to a startup. Thoughts and experiences appreciated :)",
