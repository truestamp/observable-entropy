      "text": "I&#x27;m making the switch from Mac OS to Linux as my daily driver. I&#x27;m planning on running Debian with kde. Using one of the vanilla builds provided by Debian without too much customization.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to find someone who has also made the switch and can share resources they&#x27;ve found helpful.<p>I&#x27;ve been a java back end dev for about 10 years now with experience deploying and running services on Linux. I know my  way around the command line, not entirely uncomfortable with building things from source, and put myself at an intermediate level knowledge of Linux.<p>I&#x27;d like to learn more about general OS internals, filesystem layout, the various OS services, etc. from the POV of the system operator&#x2F;user.<p>Also looking for any suggestions for reading&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;youtube for more becoming a more advanced CLI user.<p>Thank you",
