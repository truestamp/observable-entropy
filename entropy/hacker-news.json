      "text": "In the last week I have taken an interest in and done some research on the state of Single Board Computers (perhaps motivated by the release of the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W).<p>It is striking to me that, while there are a plethora of different smartphone designs using ARM cores released in the last couple of years, the same cannot be said at all for SBCs.<p>The tendency there is for most designs to use SoCs which are based on Cortex A72 or Cortex A73 cores (or similar). These are now 5+ years old. What gives?<p>If you want an SBC with a recent ARM core there&#x27;s basically nothing out there. You can get the Snapdragon 888 developer kit for $1400, but that&#x27;s double what a base spec Snapdragon 888 based phone would cost! Or next year you might be able to get the Jetson AGX Orin with Cortex-A78 cores, but that one also packs a lot of GPU and NPU power and will surely be north of $1000 as well.<p>Why are there no SBCs using Cortex-A77 or newer and coming in below $400? The chips are out there and surely it is much easier to design an SBC than a smartphone. The closest thing I know of to what I am envisioning is the $400 Jetson Xavier NX, but it is on the very high end of the $200-400 price range I&#x27;m thinking of and is using an odd in-house-designed ARMv8.2A chip that is already a few years old.<p>I&#x27;m in the position where I think things like RasPi are great, but personally would like to play with something similar that has compute power close to a mid-range smartphone released the same year. I would be happy to pay around $300 and am sure there are plenty of people in a similar position.  So there is pent up demand, what is keeping this market hole empty?<p>I suppose, since Nvidia is getting closest to scratching this itch, my dream would be for them to finally properly open-source some mainline kernel graphics drivers (maybe contribute to Nouveau directly!) and to release a new Jetson board for about $250-350 based on Cortex-A78 next year. I suspect those would shock them with the sales figures.",
