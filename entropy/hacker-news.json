      "text": "I&#x27;m a senior developer with 15+ years of experience. I&#x27;ve experienced anything from senior management asking me to hire a senior developer for 6 months to develop core features then have a meeting after his probation to tell him why he isn&#x27;t good enough by nitpicking minor mistakes in his overall communication, coding, PR styles to laying off entire US &#x2F; UK teams when they prefer offshore ones. Needless to say I quit said companies and moved on as I find this disgusting.<p>I&#x27;ve also experienced interviews where I had to develop a core feature for them as a coding test to see if im good enough, or even advise (as part of the coding test) a junior&#x2F;mid-level developer (who was the interviewer) on how to scale their backend for GPU processing and how to design the database before he told me I&#x27;m not good enough for the job as I told him he is fishing for the solution he doesn&#x27;t even have.<p>The point of this point is I want to bring to light immoral shit that startups do and possibly have a platform where we suffered from their &#x27;scams&#x27; and at least bring those to light. I want to hear more of what you have experienced with startups.<p>Were you dismissed for &quot;poor performance&quot; for reasons that do not make sense? Did your colleagues betray you or suddenly become cold and distant? what happened? This is the thread to show all the evil bullshit that startups have done to you or colleagues. How would you hold them accountable?",
