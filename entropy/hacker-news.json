      "text": "Hi, Rafael here from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curiosity.ai.<p>I was just talking to someone today that works in a restrictive IT environment (no internet), and the person mentioned how annoying it is to not have access to Stack Overflow. There is an open source project on GitHub (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tools4j&#x2F;stacked-off) that seems to provide an offline server using the public dumps, but this person found it a bit cumbersome to work with.<p>As we build a desktop search app, we could add an offline Stack Overflow integration. I was curious (!) if anyone would be interested before taking the effort to build it.<p>WDYT?",
