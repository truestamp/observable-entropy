      "text": "Can you share your experiences with available affordable solutions for video hosting user generated content?<p>This content is mainly screen recordings of mobile game play.<p>I have explored few and here are my observations<p>1. Cloud Flare Stream -&gt; Priced based on minutes streamed and stored irrespective of the bandwidth&#x2F;video quality.<p>2. AWS Media services -&gt; This may go costly as CloudFront is costly comparitively<p>3. Mux -&gt; Pricing nearly equal to Cloud Flare and priced based on streaming time<p>4. Bunny.net stream -&gt; Charged only for streaming and encoding free - Not sure how much difference it gives<p>5. Dyntube.com -&gt; Boast unlimited streaming for lowest prices but not sure about the service<p>The use-case I have is more like there can be limited videos and cost need to be optimised for streaming.<p>Can someone suggest a good option?",
