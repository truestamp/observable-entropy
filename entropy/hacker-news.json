      "text": "About a month ago I (attempted to?) transfer two domains from Hover to Cloudflare (both nameservers and registrar). These domains route my emails so they&#x27;re very important.<p>It <i>seemed</i> like everything worked fine, and I just confirmed that Cloudflare is all green for both (it even says &quot;Registrar: Cloudflare&quot; in one spot in the UI), but a couple things have shaken my confidence:<p>1) Hover is still sending me renewal emails about them. It shows a warning that one of them is about to expire, and in the dashboard it just says &quot;About to Expire&quot;, with nothing about it having been transferred or no longer being registered through Hover.<p>2) I&#x27;ve had a minor DNS issue for quite some time, where if I visit http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mywebsite.tld&#x2F; (with no www), it doesn&#x27;t route correctly to the server and instead shows a Hover &quot;site under construction&quot; page. This is not a new issue, it&#x27;s just something I need to fix, however it&#x27;s worrying that it still points to the Hover fallback page when I&#x27;m supposed to be fully moved off of Hover now.<p>Any advice or insight would be welcome. My knowledge of DNS is pretty basic so I&#x27;m feeling around in the dark right now, and one of the domains expires tomorrow according to Hover (Cloudflare says it&#x27;s good for another year?)",

(im on windows 10 machines)<p>- if so, any recommendation on cloud provider?<p>im looking at hetzner cloud. Im in EU so their german data center would not be too far away.",
