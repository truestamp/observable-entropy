This of course is obvious in retrospect in order to report income to the IRS.<p>If you have been successful at accepting payment through your business&#x2F;blog, are you creating an LLC&#x2F;business or registering your details under your personal account (individual&#x2F;sole proprietor)? I feel quite lost as I&#x27;m unsure of the various options one could take to accept payments.<p>Your advice or guidance to other materials would be appreciated - I&#x27;m sure many of us are not familiar with the business-side of things and would like to monetize our work!",

      "text": "I haven’t seen any apps like this where you can guess the price and win the item on Appstore. \nGist of my idea - Basically build an app and ask the users to guess the price of an item. If they guess it right, they’ll get the item. Only one item&#x2F;day in the beginning since I’ll have to fund it myself. Users don’t have to spend anything so I’m hoping the retention will be high and I can monetize it atleast using Ads later.  \nAny suggestion is appreciated",
