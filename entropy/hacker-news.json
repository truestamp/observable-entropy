      "text": "Hi, looks like another team is interested in one of our tables, they&#x27;re planning to just read, so it will be 100% read-only queries (probably from replica).<p>I&#x27;m curious, how popular&#x2F;acceptable&#x2F;hopeless such pattern is?<p>I understand that giving someone read access to the database isn&#x27;t free (we cannot change schema easily, we cannot change DB, etc) but at the same time, we don&#x27;t need to create a dummy HTTP-service to just do simple queries (and spend more time on unmarshal-marshal stuff).<p>Let&#x27;s assume I&#x27;m asking about Postgres but will be very happy to hear stories or thoughts about other DBs (relational, nosql, graph, wide-column, analytical, inmem, etc) and are there any difference in sharing them practically or architectural.<p>Thank you.",
