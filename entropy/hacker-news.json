The beta API is expected to be ready by the end of April.<p>The prototype of Bionic Reading so far is already available in 3 RSS apps. In “Reeder 4+5”, in “Fiery Feeds” and in “Lire”.<p>Now I want to make the reading mode available to as many people as possible. Moms and dads, students, CEOs, people with dyslexia and many more write to me. And also many who can read even faster with Bionic Reading than before.<p>If you are interested, please sign up on the website.\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;bionic-reading.com<p>I would be happy if BR is in your app or service and so many people can be helped.<p>Best regards from the Swiss Alps.
