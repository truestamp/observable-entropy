      "text": "Hey HN! Esolang Park is an online visual debugger interface for esoteric programming languages, that I&#x27;ve been working on for the past few months. For every supported language, Esolang Park provides the powerful Monaco code editor, syntax checking, debugging functionality and a visualisation of the runtime state. The core is language-agnostic - a &quot;language provider&quot; only needs to implement the esolang&#x27;s parser, interpreter and visualisation UI (and some other little stuff).<p>Apart from trying to boost DX for esolangs, the idea is for this to grow into a platform where people can discover and play around with a variety of esolangs without leaving the browser. That&#x27;s quite far away though - the project is quite early in development and currently only has 5 languages (Befunge-93, Brainf*ck, Chef, Deadfish and Shakespeare).<p>Happy to hear any feedback (and bug reports too)!",
