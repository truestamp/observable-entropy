      "text": "Yesterday, at the bottom of any PR on Github, I was able to copy-paste the `git checkout` instructions, so I can test it on my machine. Today, those `git checkout` instructions only show up if there&#x27;s a merge conflict (at least for me):<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;Qf2fmhw<p>*Are you seeing the same thing?*<p>-----<p>To me, this is very inconvenient. If there is no merge conflict, what I have to do is:\n- scroll all the way up the page;\n- click the &quot;Code&quot; button;\n- copy-paste instructions for Github CLI or use Github Desktop;<p>But... it&#x27;s not practical for me to use Github CLI or Github Desktop. I want simple `git checkout` instructions, that I can copy-paste to get that PR working on my machine. You know, like in the good old days... yesterday<p>*Please tell me they&#x27;re just A&#x2F;B testing this and I&#x27;m unlucky for seeing it.*<p>PS. Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Apologies if this doesn&#x27;t qualify for an &quot;Ask HN&quot; post. Just wanted to find out how far-reaching&#x2F;permanent this change is... and get help reaching out to Github to convince them not to do this.",
