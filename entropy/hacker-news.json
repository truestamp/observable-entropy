Just wanted to ask how you guys deal with programming burnout over time.<p>Dealing with abstract design and diagrams doesn&#x27;t bother me, but physically writing code feels horrible. I feel like the more I do it, the less confident I feel about it.<p>It&#x27;s weird because a year ago I felt the opposite.<p>For anyone who&#x27;s felt this way or similar to this: does it go away? How did you handle it?",
