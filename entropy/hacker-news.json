      "text": "I&#x27;ve just tried to open a project in freshly Visual Studio 2019 on another Windows 10 machine with all the updates installed... and it asked me to manually install .Net Framework 4.8 or downgrade the project to 4.6. This reminded me I have always been wondering why did we always have to install all these VisualC++ &quot;redistributables&quot;, common controls, MDAC, MSXML, DirectX and all sorts of things like that? Why wouldn&#x27;t MS just bundle all they have with Windows and then push all the missing&#x2F;updated ones through Windows Update as they arrive? What&#x27;s the motivation behind this policy?",
