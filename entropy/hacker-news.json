I like to turn on the calculator and immediately start entering data, and that wasn&#x27;t happening with the TI-89.<p>I see there is a newer version of the TI-84 (CE Python) and I wonder if it handles more like a TI-84, or like a TI-89.  Are there any other (modern, and preferably rechargeable) calculators that I should consider?",

      "text": "I recently submitted a story from a well-known, reputable journalist about an important current issue that touches upon many areas of intellectual interest. It was flagged to death within seconds. The next day, I noticed the same story submitted by someone else; again it was killed within seconds. In both cases the stories had received a handful of upvotes, and in my case several comments (not a flamewar) before being flagged.<p>The efficiency of this organized flagging activity is impressive. The target is clearly stories that have political implications that a certain faction would prefer to suppress. I know that HN has algorithms to detect such things as voting rings. Why are flagging gangs allowed to operate?",
