      "text": "Hi there!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on (and using) a command-line utility for Atlassian Jira for the past few months. The initial release is available now: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ankitpokhrel&#x2F;jira-cli&#x2F;releases<p>Project Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ankitpokhrel&#x2F;jira-cli<p>Some of the features include<p>1. Interactive mode + an option to easily integrate with shell&#x2F;automation scripts using standard POSIX-complaint flags.\n2. Easy search and navigation. For instance, you can easily search for something like &quot;Issues that are of high priority, is in progress, was created this month, and has a label called backend&quot; with `jira issue list -yHigh -s&quot;In Progress&quot; --created month -lbackend`\n3. Create a neat Jira ticket (and comment) using Github-flavored + Jira-flavored markdown as a template. Supports pre-defined templates.\n4. The ticket details are translated to markdown from the Atlassian document and is  beautifully displayed on the screen when you view it.\n5. Easy sprint and epic navigation. You can quickly view tickets in previous, current, and next sprint tickets using flags like --prev, --next, and --current eg: `jira sprint list --current`.\n6. Fast and straightforward ticket cloning with the ability to replace text in summary and description.\n7. You can edit, link, assign and transition the issues with ease.<p>Check out the project for more details: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ankitpokhrel&#x2F;jira-cli<p>Your suggestions and feedback is highly appreciated. Feel free to start a discussion or create an issue to share your experience about the tool or to discuss a feature&#x2F;issue.",
