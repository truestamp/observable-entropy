      "text": "I listen to a lot of audiobooks—some of them ripped straight from CDs in lossless quality—on a pair of Airmotiv 4S speakers. While these are far from the best speakers money can buy, most reviews consider them to be high quality studio monitors, appropriate for use by professional audio engineers. (I am not a professional audio engineer.)<p>I would generally expect these speakers to be overkill for spoken-word content. However, although they do make audiobooks sound quite good, I can definitely tell that these recordings are being played back on a pair of speakers. I would never mistake them for a person who is physically in the room with me.<p>Why? Would it be possible to create an audio setup which makes spoken-word content indistinguishable from a real person? In other words, if my eyes are closed, I shouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference between electronic speakers and a human sitting next to me.<p>What would it take? Does it come down to the speakers, or how the audio is mastered, or something else?",
