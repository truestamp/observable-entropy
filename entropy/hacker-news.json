      "text": "There are many articles about efforts to prevent the discovery of abortions in states where they are illegal. When I read them, I wonder why writers think it is possible to remain anonymous in 2022. The attack surface seems wildly large:<p>- Phone geolocation\n- Payments\n- Text messages\n- Web history\n- Public security cameras\n- Biological tests to determine past pregnancy<p>For example, how does one secure one&#x27;s browsing history? One need take many, many steps these days, and even then, it is rarely secure.<p>How is one to complete a payment online anonymously?<p>Do parcel shipping companies intend to resist court orders mandating disclosure of sender&#x2F;recipient addresses &quot;outside the envelope&quot;?<p>How does one travel on a US highway without leaving a record via security cameras?<p>There are better and worse security practices, but I don&#x27;t see how a truly determined adversary can fail to discover abortions. And the attacker seems determined.<p>It suggests the only way to make abortions undiscoverable is to completely rethink our  privacy regime.",
