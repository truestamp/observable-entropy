      "text": "Hi, \nI am a young dad who starting to save for my kids. I was wondering whats the smarter play - Should I set up recurring payments into a tax-sheltered savings account (e.g. junior ISA in the UK) or get a crypto wallet and start saving Bitcoin? The idea is that I can get them a head start about learning about the space as they get older and have an initial investment. On the other side, there is a natural downside risk of the volatility of the asset. Curious to hear your thoughts!",
