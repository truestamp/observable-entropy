I didn&#x27;t even graduate.<p>I also got rejected for junior roles at companies that I would have really loved to work at(not even ultra selective companies, I didn&#x27;t even get interviews), so I&#x27;m really wondering: am I overselling myself and people think I&#x27;m better than actually am?(i.e good enough for senior roles, but overqualified for junior roles?)<p>Depending on who I talk to, I feel like I&#x27;m either underestimated(to lowball me?) or way overestimated.<p>How do I show my worth without looking better than I actually am?<p>I really don&#x27;t want to be under-delivering and disappoint everyone at my next job",
