      "text": "There is this great literature site I used to love, which closed down some years ago. My only consolation was \nto visit the Wayback Machine and read all the pages there. I was wondering how many other great sites I am missing\nbecause they are no longer accessible. Do you have any suggestions?<p>In an ironic twist, I have just discovered that the  site has been taken down from the Wayback Machine. It is redirecting\nnow to a new site the authors are creating. It pains me to say it looks inferior in every single\nway, and most of the original content is gone. Their prerogative, I suppose.",
