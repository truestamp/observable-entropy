      "text": "Hello! I have a few people working for me who regularly need to go &quot;on-site&quot; and carry their laptops with them. Sometimes the location is kind of unfriendly (dust, high temps etc) and also the fact they&#x27;re carrying their laptop with them all the time means the device is constantly exposed to being hit or dropped, which of course causes damage. I want to start providing them with company laptops soon, and I was thinking to buy them M1 Airs based on the great battery life and fanless design. Even though it&#x27;s made of aluminum, the Mac isn&#x27;t really a &quot;rugged&quot; device and I was interested in how I can offer them better protection. Does anyone have any experience with this? Is there something you can recommend?",
