      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;m personally very unsophisticated as concerns biology, I have what amounts to undergraduate-requirement bio (and my own career to focus on): so I don&#x27;t aspire to be an expert or even to be equipped to give advice to others.<p>Nonetheless I, like most others, have to make day-to-day decisions about a great many things regarding COVID-19: do I have my Moderna boosted, when should I wear a mask, is travel a good idea, is dining out a good idea this month? I would like to do so in as scientific and apolitical a way as is possible for a non-expert.<p>It seems like such a polarizing topic that I&#x27;m personally having trouble sifting the signal out of the noise about it, and I doubt that I&#x27;m alone.<p>Is there a resource or set of resources available to the layperson willing to read a lot for becoming at least somewhat conversant in the key science, developments, legitimate controversies, spurious controversies, and generally the lay of the land that is balanced, apolitical, globally-minded, and actionable?<p>Thanks in advance!<p>P.S. I hope I don&#x27;t start a flamewar by asking. I&#x27;m looking for how to hear even-handed, civil debate that doesn&#x27;t involve a flamewar and my Google-fu is inadequate to find it.",
