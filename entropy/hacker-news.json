      "text": "hey folks!<p>My book Real-World Cryptography was just released and is now shipping. I&#x27;ve been working on this thing for the last two years and a half, and the goal was to give a good overview of everything that can be classified as &quot;real-world&quot; about crypto. You&#x27;ll find all the basics in the first half of the book, and the second half contains chapters on TLS, noise, PAKEs, post-quantum cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, MPC, cryptocurrencies, FHE, etc.<p>So it&#x27;s a good pick if you&#x27;re learning, but also if you&#x27;ve been in the field for a while and want an intro to some subfield you&#x27;re interested in. It&#x27;s not a reference book, and is written in a light style. Also has some art and lots of diagrams.<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s the link :)  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manning.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;real-world-cryptography?a_aid=Realworldcrypto&amp;a_bid=ad500e09",
