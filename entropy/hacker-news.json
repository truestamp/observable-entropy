      "text": "Based on OpenAI&#x27;s CLIP and the clip-retrieval library (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rom1504&#x2F;clip-retrieval), I&#x27;ve built an end-to-end demo for a semantic and similarity image search engine. It&#x27;s incredibly powerful for finding similar images amongst large image datasets, or just submitting text&#x2F;natural language queries and finding the most relevant images in your dataset. Really useful tool for introspection into large datasets before annotation or ML work begins. This could potentially be used to filter or downsize your datasets by several orders of magnitude and make annotation and ML work easier and less costly.<p>Checkout the demo here:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec2-52-39-251-116.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com&#x2F;<p>And you can checkout our website or email me for updates and email list, etc.:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machineperception.co\nameer@machineperception.co",

      "text": "By API, I mean whatever calls that are managing your front-end data. For example, if I had many user inputs that managed closely related data, should I start from a user perspective and build out all the components with empty calls? Or should I define and build out all the calls themselves before even thinking about the components (assuming the spec isn&#x27;t super strict)? Fwiw I&#x27;m assuming a reactive, data-driven front-end. Also assuming the priority is extensibility. Does any of that makes sense lol",
