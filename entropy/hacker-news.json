      "text": "I started coding with PHP a decade ago, then Node.js 5 years later, and last year I started working with Typescript and Vue.js<p>And as much as I love the whole JS ecosystem, I&#x27;ll admit that for me it&#x27;s a pain in the *ss to quickly build a MVP while still caring about code quality.<p>It&#x27;s cool for toy projects, it&#x27;s also good if you have the time and the skills to build a big project with a real professional architecture, but for quick MVPs I find it kinda lame and slow, I rarely finish MVPs in JS actually.<p>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of amazing stuff about RubyOnRails, but I have this weird, maybe mistaken impression that it&#x27;s a thing of the past(The stats about RoR in StackOverflow Surveys don&#x27;t look great for example), or something too easy they teach at bootcamps to people who never coded, because it&#x27;s the only stuff you can realistically learn in 2 months.<p>I know of the stories about Airbnb, Github etc...\nbut have they actually used it for a decent period of time with a large number of users?<p>Or was it mostly just quick prototyping and then quickly having to remake everything from scratch?<p>I just read this article from DHH called &quot;the one person framework&quot; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;world.hey.com&#x2F;dhh&#x2F;the-one-person-framework-711e6318, and I&#x27;m almost convinced, but at the same time he created it, so it&#x27;s kinda biased and I don&#x27;t know what to think.<p>Also how do you think the market will look like for RoR devs in 2 years?<p>Thanks",
