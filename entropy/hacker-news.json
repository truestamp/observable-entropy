      "text": "I am planning to do my masters in CS the future. My initial interests while applying were specifically in NLP &#x2F;computational linguistics. However, I don&#x27;t have much experience in it other than a survey paper in my undergrad. \nfor various reasons, I ended up doing a sponsored project in embedded (rasp pi hooked up to a PLC for measuring biogas plant values) which i did not enjoy much.<p>Recently, I found compilers&#x2F;programming languages very intriguing and contemplating preparing on the topic. Maybe getting some experience by contributing&#x2F;using open source projects like LLVM etc.<p>First off, is it a good idea to choose topics and prepare to gain some experience before starting the masters? if so, how to approach  any topic and prepare?",
