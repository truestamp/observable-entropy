      "text": "I can&#x27;t find a thread about this already, so here&#x27;s one. Basically, on the latest version of Firefox Mobile (for iOS), the refresh button, which was directly to the right of the forward and back buttons on the bottom bar (near my thumb), has been awkwardly integrated into the already cluttered URL bar. It&#x27;s replacement, the home button, is something I almost never use, whereas I refresh quite often.<p>Am I crazy for thinking this was a bad UI change? Is there a way to fix this myself?",
