      "text": "Just curious. I consider myself to be pretty skeptical of the long term &quot;revolutionary&quot; effects of cryptocurrencies (aka virtual currencies, digital assets, etc.) over the long haul; that said, I have difficulty imagining it disappearing entirely.<p>Even Beanie Babies still exist, they just aren&#x27;t worth much.<p>So where do you see &quot;crypto,&quot; to the extent that can be a monolithic term, in 10 years? 20? 50? I&#x27;ll hazard some serious, but somewhat intentionally cheeky, predictions:<p>10: ETH has overtaken BTC, accounts for most of the market cap in crypto. Like IE 5.5.<p>20: Difficulty here, I want to say I imagine it is all gone entirely in favor of ... something else. There is a great exodus of money from crypto to that &quot;something else&quot; over a period of 5-7 years. Lots of stories about how &quot;BTC has a market cap of just $1m now, at its peak it was $1t&quot; etc.<p>50: LaserDisc era. There are enthusiasts still MLMing coins to each other. Most weren&#x27;t alive during the BTC heyday and are essentially larping.",
