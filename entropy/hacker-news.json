      "text": "So Bluetooth headsets are still horrible when connected to a Desktop or Laptop. Other than an Apple headset to an Apple device, everything else is still in a horrible condition. I just realized that before buying a headset you need to check if supports all the codecs you need:<p>Sony devices =&gt; LDAC, AAC<p>Apple =&gt; AAC<p>Android =&gt; AptX, LDAC<p>Windows =&gt; AptX, AAC<p>And don&#x27;t forget about the Bluetooth profiles on windows for A2DP (better sound quality, no mic) vs HSP&#x2F;HFP (with mic but much worse quality). And Windows cannot yet use a mic with a stereo sound quality even on Bluetooth 5 and Windows 11.<p>You also need to be sure that your Desktop&#x2F;Laptop should have a compatible&#x2F;modern Bluetooth (5 vs 4 vs older) transmitter to use any good quality codec that&#x27;s mentioned up here.<p>Such a mess!",
