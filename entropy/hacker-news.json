      "text": "I am frustrated with doing file searches on MacOS. I used to love mdfind. It was so fast and gave me hits on everything no matter where I was in a directory. Parts of filename, or something in the file would show up on mdfind. Now it&#x27;s like not giving a search. I copied the exact filename and not a hit. I tried using the regular smart folder setting it to show recent images created, modified, and opened. Fiddled around with that after changing it to 2 days I got two results. But there should be three! And even when I put down 1 day it would not show up even when it was created &quot;Today&quot; it should have shown up in search. The search function is totally obfuscated and I&#x27;m at loss to figure out a reliable search method for this computer. MacOS running 11.3.1",
