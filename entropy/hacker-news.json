      "text": "I’m doing a bit of research to learn about the decision-making criteria used by the people who design and build hardware, especially people who do product development in telecom, datacom, networking, and other things that have circuit boards – OEM or component manufacturers. I’m trying to learn how engineers think.<p>In short: Who decides which vendors you use in constructing the device? How does that decision come about? (I’m thinking more in terms of “pieces that are used inside the box,” from adhesives and other advanced materials to external ports, though you’re welcome to respond more broadly if you prefer.)<p>In a little more detail:<p>* Let’s say you are designing a new product. Who – that is, what position or function – makes the decision on the specific materials and vendors you’ll use? When you consider multiple suppliers, what is your firm’s evaluation process for the vendors and their products? I’m looking less for formal procurement processes and more for those informal conversations that make you or your colleagues choose a supplier either off the approved list or just one you may not have used before.<p>* Who is included in the decision-making process? (Which positions or job functions?) Who are the influencers? Who makes the recommendations? And who is the final decision maker? Are trusted partners&#x2F;vendors ever included in the decision-making processes, and if so, how?<p>* How does product development timing work in terms of bringing in a new or different vendor? When in the process are those conversations had, by whom, and who’s involved?<p>* What is your process for comparing alternative products, during design, prototyping, and testing phases – or other phases in product development? Who in the firm conducts the tests?<p>I’m gathering this information as a form of market research, so that I&#x2F;we can inform a client about “what real people do.” I’m not interested here in your relationship with any particular product or vendor – just the process by which you make decisions.",
