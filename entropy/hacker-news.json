      "text": "Hi,<p>I can&#x27;t seem to find decent training material for the Solutions Architect Associate AWS certification. The official stuff on skillbuilder doesn&#x27;t seem to cover everything you need - when I look at practise questions, I often struggle because they involve very minute details of a specific and commonly used AWS service like EC2.<p>My question is - for those who have done it or are thinking about doing it - what full courses would you do? Preferably not these ridiculously priced ones that are regurgitated from somewhere else anyway - I don&#x27;t think the people of HN are privy to paying $5,000 for level CompTIA crap.<p>Another question would be whether I&#x27;m misunderstanding the point of the &quot;Solutions Architect&quot; certification range - is it the <i>point</i> that it&#x27;s not full of stuff you can learn in one fell swoop?",
