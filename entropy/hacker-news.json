I took an accidental 10 year hiatus and I&#x27;ve been polishing it up recently to get back into it.<p>It used to be really popular to promote your RSS feed. Might have just been the circles I swam in, but <i>people knew what to do with it</i>. I&#x27;ve maintained this big orange RSS symbol in my main navigation and I wonder: Does anybody actually know what to do with this now?<p>Firefox used to offer subscription options but I don&#x27;t see anything in the navbar any more. If you click the symbol on my page, you just see an ugly page of XML.<p>In the vain hope that somebody might want to see what I&#x27;m writing and be notified about it, how do I enable this? Do I have to post updates on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and etc, etc?<p>I&#x27;ve been consuming RSS for all this time but the rest of the world seems to have moved on. Feeling pretty old right now.<p>My blog, just in case, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thepcspy.com",
