      "text": "With the increase of Arm based laptops, there seems to be less dependence on Windows. A lot of the software that was previously designed for x86 isn&#x27;t compatible.<p>During Windows RT, Microsoft failed to port Office to Arm. They now have it running on Windows 11 thanks to emulation. But that doesn&#x27;t apply to everything, certainly not gaming.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s going to be a compatibility gap. A period of time where people won&#x27;t be able to run their old x86 programs on ARM because the emulation and hardware resources available simply aren&#x27;t advanced enough.<p>Most consumers don&#x27;t really care what operating system comes with their computer, they just want something to run their programs. Will hardware vendors take this as an opportunity to &quot;break the chains&quot; from Windows. Or is this dependency not relevant enough anymore for vendors to even be concerned.",
