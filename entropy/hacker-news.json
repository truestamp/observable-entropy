      "text": "Was recently looking at political donations made by major tech companies and it was evident that most divert a large share of their lobbying spending on the Democratic party. I believe this is one such indicator of &quot;liberal&quot; leaning. Another is adoption of woke practices and ideas. It&#x27;s pretty easy i think to point out liberal or progressive tech companies. Is there the equivalent for conservative? If not, what does that say about the tech sector?",
