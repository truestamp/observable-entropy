      "text": "I&#x27;m really on the fence on this. Here is my short-list of Pro&#x2F;Cons:<p>&gt;&gt;  LAPTOP PRO<p>— fluid ergonomics —\nThese days our son uses our laptop usually on the couch, laying down. This is way more comfortable than sitting down.\n — mobility —  Has the ability to take the laptop on a trip&#x2F;plane<p>&gt;&gt;  LAPTOP CON<p>— high risk for damage &#x2F; delicate &#x2F; low longevity  —\nBecause it is mobile it can risk damage during travel or just carrying it around.<p>—  2x LESS bang for the $ — He is a gamer and it would cost 2x more to get the same performance as the desktop<p>&gt;&gt;  DESKTOP PRO<p>— 2x MORE Bang for the $  — \n— 2x larger Screen\n— Less Delicate<p>— More Parental Control — if I set it up in our living room, we can get a better sense of what he is doing.<p>&gt;&gt;  DESKTOP CON<p>— rigid ergonomics —<p>He will be forced to sit still for 2-3hrs. ( im debating if this is a negative thing! )  but it will basically start him on a sitting habit very early in his development life.\n *Now, im thinking I can just setup a standing desk for him instead..which would tire him out quicker and reduce his usage. hmm",
