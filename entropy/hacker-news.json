      "text": "* A rant post, but that&#x27;s the only option I&#x27;ve got left\nTL;DR - FedEx charged me for fees that they shouldn&#x27;t have, Digikey told me that if and after I&#x27;ll pay they will resolve it but ditched me right after<p>FedEx:\nIt all started as a regular order from Digikey, International shipping, small package, low price ($74~, $29 shipping)\nThe price is set this way for a reason - this is the limit that is a tax free package locally.<p>The package arrived to the country  , and call me to ask for another payment, $62~ for a $74 package.<p>They said that they labeled it as a commercial package, and that&#x27;s why\nonly $20 if for tax and the other is for FedEx (which is outraging by itself, to electrically fill a form that is already half automated, there is no law restricting them or enable competition)<p>I told them they made a mistake, declaring it as a commercial import, which is definitely not, they told me some bushtit about if its more then 3 items its commercial (which is not true, and there is a component of knowledge of the tax reviewer on the specific subject to determine if its an unreasonable amount, for anyone that know something about the subject, a few ring terminals and connectors and not a business )<p>A concrete example: A few months before that I ordered from Digikey a $200 order, and payed a total of $80 tax and fees total, and yes - they declared it as private (UPS)<p>They didn&#x27;t want to acknowledge that, so obviously I told them its outrages and I wont accept it and return it, They said ok and hang up immediately.\nI sent them an email telling them again that they are wrong and make it right, or update me on how the return goes - they didn&#x27;t reply.<p>After asking around in local groups, I&#x27;ve become aware this is a recurring practice of FedEx Israel, as it already happened in additional cases I know of, extract more money per shipment.<p>Digikey:\nA local representative called me, saying that FedEx will charge me $300 for a return, I push him on that and he lied about it, because the truth is they will charge digikey (FedEx also have no way of charging me)<p>He told me that and then continue and said that if I pay them (which will save Digikey the hassle) they will &quot;make it right&quot;, and deal with FedEx.<p>I obliged, believing him even if he lied to fix their problem\nNext day he called and asked if I payed, and told me that in the future every time I make an order I will call them and they will give me a small discount until I recoup my $62<p>Its a classic &quot;Hard to redeem benefit so they are not gonna use it, wont worth the hassle&quot;, and also will take ages to redeem. I told him that I have no plans on any order in the near future, this was for a specific project that is now done.<p>A few hours later I got an email from him (now that he knows that he successfully resolved the issue for Digikey) and told me that they wont help me dealing with Fedex, and that the only thing he can offer is the small discounts<p>And that&#x27;s it.<p>Digikey is a nice place to buy from, good search, good selection of components and low minimum, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s also overpriced with crazy margins, and with the over the top packaging that sometimes the nylon it comes with worth more then the content, we pay for all that.\nAnd its fine if you at least get a decent treatment when edge cases happens.<p>Before Digikey came into the picture it was just Fedex with a somewhat dishonest mistake, but then it got weird<p>I feel cheated, I paid so much for so little, and I shouldn&#x27;t have, I dont got any leverage, so a post is the only thing that I got left<p>Agree with me or not, it was a bad experience for me",

      "text": "Around 5 years ago I decided I would put some money in my bank &#x2F; brokerages managed fund program where your money is actively traded on your behalf for a small monthly fee (this fee ends up being about $150 - $200 a month)<p>The performance of this managed account over the past 5 years while doing well has never beat the returns of index funds that do not cost a monthly fee to invest in, so would now be a good time to sell in order to reinvest the funds outside of the managed fund?<p>I don’t really see a great way of getting out of this fund, either I sell when the market is doing well only to pay capital gains taxes and put the money right back into the market, or I sell now at a reduced gain, pay less tax to put it right back into the market, but get rid of the monthly fee. The fee itself is not a major concern to me, but it just seems stupid to continue paying it when I’m not getting any large benefit from even when the market is doing well and I’ve given it plenty of time to see if paying the fee somehow gets you better returns",

But I recently came across Envato Elements (when I was looking for good font combinations for an ebook) and thought it would help me get some things I have to do at times done quickly, especially when I don&#x27;t care &#x27;creatively&#x27; about the output but just need a reasonable output.<p>Probably other people here don&#x27;t have my problems using stock content, and know good alternatives.<p>I want stuff where I can quickly find tweakable print templates, video &#x2F; audio, fonts etc. in one place so I can make a potential project presentation quickly.<p>What tools do you use to get the boring parts of &#x27;creative&#x27; work done quickly?",
