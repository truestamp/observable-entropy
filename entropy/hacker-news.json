      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m shortly finishing up my studies and I wanted to chose a field to deepen my knowledge in.\nThis way I can hopefully become really competent.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in Enterprise as a intern for a comparably long time, but I&#x27;m having doubts if it is the right choice. (Maybe not so fun, moves slowly)<p>Machine Learning and Crypto seem in comparison really interesting fields but they may not pan out. (higher risk)<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for the opinion of more veteran players on how they made their decisions in the younger years and if you have any advice.<p>Thanks in advance :)",
