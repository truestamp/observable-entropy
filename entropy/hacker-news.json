      "text": "I suck at CSS. There, I said it.<p>I&#x27;ve always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let&#x27;s me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.<p>I understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I&#x27;ve gather after a few days, I don&#x27;t understand it.<p>Instead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don&#x27;t want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.<p>Ok, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn&#x27;t that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?<p>I must be missing something, right?",

If you found enough sections of value you would buy it.  On the web, we can&#x27;t flip (unless it&#x27;s a PDF, which may even be worse).<p>This is a public service announcement.  Your time, which effectively is the currency of your life, is probably more valuable to you than to some corporate entity.  So use it wisely, and terminate quickly your attention on websites which don&#x27;t really provide something.",
