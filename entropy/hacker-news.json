      "text": "My client has a deeply ingrained culture of information hoarding and strict job definitions, and it&#x27;s holding them back from being able to scale their operation. The work isn&#x27;t difficult or complex but completing it takes forever due to all the hand-offs and errors caused by a lack of up-to-date documentation. I can&#x27;t grow the team because their culture makes it really difficult for new people to come up to speed.<p>They don&#x27;t even follow the docs that they have, and they certainly don&#x27;t update them when they notice errors or omissions.  In some cases, I&#x27;ve witnessed them performing a task that is documented on a Wiki page (last updated: 2016!), but they skip some steps, perform others differently from the doc, and do things not covered in the doc at all.  When I asked why they don&#x27;t update the docs, they respond with claims of &quot;it&#x27;s not my doc&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s owned by Team X&quot; so they can&#x27;t change it.<p>They rarely describe the solution for bug fixes in the Jira ticket and instead just declare it fixed and pass it to QA so the knowledge stays with the person that fixed the bug. They&#x27;ve even refused to share their screen during live debugging sessions and instead just loosely describe what they&#x27;re doing in words.<p>How can I foster a culture of information sharing?",
