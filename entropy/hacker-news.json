      "text": "The easy out for Ukraine was to just go neutral, like Austria.<p>Then live happily ever after.<p>And, ps, your enemy has a trump card in the form of a massive nuclear weapon stash -- maybe the largest in the world -- you want to force him to play his trump card?<p>The US is the only country to have detonated nukes in a war situation -- there is already precedent -- the world did not end -- it might not end this time, too. Maybe. Nuclear weapon use is definitely on the table.<p>You, as Ukraine, do not have nukes -- but you fight a nuclear power anyways? Whut?<p>Instead, if you went neutral, you could lead the vanguard in establishing nuclear-free zones in Europe. You could still buy lots of guns and big trucks, like many of your American friends, in case you need your toxic masculinity to run a bit wild -- just no nukes or other big missile systems and such that could really damage Russia too quickly.<p>Nobody could blame you for acceding to &#x27;the madman, Putin&#x27; -- Putin could have easily wiped Ukraine off the map, you _had_ to agree to neutrality -- this is the easiest out ever -- let everybody else worry about fighting proxy wars.<p>Of course, the US could turn Bambi into the greatest monster on earth, so there&#x27;s that.<p>But if your enemy has THESUPERDUPERMEGADEATHGUN, wouldn&#x27;t you rather just _not_ fight with them? Maybe you can just give the bully your lunchtime scooby-doo snack and live to fight another day?<p>Is there another explanation for Ukraine&#x27;s&#x2F;Zelenskyy&#x27;s behavior here, other than the obvious, that is -- that the US forced him to do it?<p>(Else, he&#x27;d lose US support, and the next US-supported comedian&#x2F;actor&#x2F;dictator&#x2F;whatever would come in.)<p>I&#x27;m also curious why Europe supported this.<p>Every intelligence service in the world knew that Russia would attack Ukraine if US&#x2F;Nato&#x2F;EU&#x2F;Europe kept pushing Ukraine into Nato membership.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in hippie-dippie morality right and wrong stuff, here -- I&#x27;m talking pure realpolitik -- &#x27;great power politics&#x27; -- whatever label you want to put on it.<p>What was Europe thinking?<p>It seems to me that the 75% chance outcome was a MASSIVE refugee crisis throughout Europe -- and about 8,000 other detrimental effects of this policy-which-would-inevitably-lead-to-war-and-disaster-soon.<p>Europe was _so_ intent on pleasing their master, the US, that they intentionally and recklessly followed _this_ path??<p>That legit seems crazy to me.<p>If there&#x27;s not a moral reason for it, and there&#x27;s not a realpolitik reason for it, then... what&#x27;s left?<p>Insanity?<p>I think Zelenskyy chose himself over his country, but to me that&#x27;s expected -- Putin did the same thing, Biden, Trump, most of Europe, etc. Politicians gonna pol.<p>But if you&#x27;re say, the leader of France -- Macron -- why get behind Nato expansion for Ukraine? Ditto Germany.<p>Are you so subservient to US power that you have no ability to act in your own best interests?<p>It&#x27;s just difficult to believe that is the actual situation we&#x27;re in.<p>So, I don&#x27;t agree on the actions that most direct&#x2F;early players in this situation took, but they make sense -- they&#x27;re logical.<p>The US -- gain near-absolute freedom to act lawlessly and unilaterly around the world with impunity<p>Russia -- try to establish yourself as a powerful nation once again, and don&#x27;t let the US box you in<p>Zelenskyy -- stay in office<p>Europe -- ???",
