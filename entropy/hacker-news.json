      "text": "I had a contract that ended in late 2019 and that was the last job I&#x27;ve worked. My current resume still shows my freelance experience as ongoing, with the date range of &quot;2015 to present&quot;. At what point should I just cut it off and be blunt with my experience, and tell people I have not worked since 2019?<p>I&#x27;m sure this puts an interesting spin after COVID and that certainly had created obstacles (job openings I applied to have closed mid-interviews). But is it safer today, a full two years later after my contract ended, to just tell on my resume my last job was two years ago?<p>I would like to not scare people reading my resume, but I also do not want to cause people to ask, why is the section so short for 6 years of time. Seems very hard to avoid both issues at the same time.",

      "text": "These are things the Romans are experts at:<p>wheat flour - bakers were some of the highest paid tradesmen, Rome thought often of bread. Wheat flour is a toughener. Gluten when mineralized, fossilized, and hardened is very tough.<p>ash – fossilizer they lived in a volcanic region<p>slacked lime and concentrated urea (like mule urine) – hardener and calcifier<p>porous volcanic rock filler – makes it more economical, it improves compressive strength<p>red cabbage juice – neutrality indicator – an emperor once abdicated his throne to grow cabbages.<p>water - They were on a long thin peninsula and watched water a lot<p>The preparation process:<p>Add 1 parts slacked lime 4 parts sifted, Italian volcanic ash to enough water to make a crumbly paste in the mixer.  Add enough durum wheat flour in the mixer to make a heavy rustic dough consistency. Mix in some porous rock. It will begin to harden all by itself so don’t let it stand too long.  Quickly add and mix enough urea to make cabbage test water blue. Test every 10th of the way. Add enough water now to make a workable cookie dough consistency mix (with the chunks of rock in there). Pour and shape into your form.<p>Explanation:<p>Urea is toxic to life because it aids calcification. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlasofscience.org&#x2F;urea-is-truly-toxic-the-empire-strikes-back&#x2F;<p>Calcium supplies the mineralization process via quicklime. Durum wheat flour has a lot of gluten in it that get denatured by urea and mineralized by quicklime. It is then fossilized by the ash. Gluten when turned into rock is very tough and hard. For even harder and more durable concrete use collagen instead of durum wheat flour or to a degree as economics afford. You must use durum wheat flour, no other flour will work. Durum flour is the bare minimum protein ratio flour you may use. Adding gluten flour may enhance toughness. Unfortunately for us as we age, aragonite crystals grow in Cartilage causing arthritis but calcium transposition in denatured protein can make exceptional concrete. And Co2 gas neutral to boot.<p>If this concrete is to be used as a salt sea pier you should use sea water instead of fresh during this process.<p>This is very expensive concrete however it will last longer than you will if you get the technique right. The great wall of china was mortared in rice and roman concrete is even better!<p>[ this is a hoax, how do you know I’m right? ]",
