      "text": "From ~2013-2015, Bittorrent had launched the interesting product Bittorrent Bleep (proprietary program[0]) which allowed for encrypted and decentralized P2P communication. While the actual product was questionable due to it being proprietary from a company with checkered track record (see the comments in the most active HN thread about the product[1]), the technology itself seemed quite interesting and promising compared to the many siloed communication platforms that were around at the same time. Yet, it appears that Bittorrent Bleep was discontinued and today prominent communication platforms, like Signal[3], have encryption but remain centralized. What happened to the technology behind Bittorrent Bleep? Does a communication platform with the same idea, P2P with encryption and decentralization, have a modern champion?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.bittorrent.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;bleep&#x2F;\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9534629\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;signal.org&#x2F;",
