Ie, recurring meetings scheduled for a specific time, when everyone would join the meeting (either physically or virtually) and give their updates<p>In an attempt to reduce people&#x27;s meeting load and avoid interruptions, we&#x27;re considering doing asynchronous slack standups instead. Ie, everyone posts their daily-update on slack at the start of their workday (no specific time). People can then follow up either on slack, or in-person, or offline, regarding any of the updates that others have posted.<p>Has anyone had experience with doing similar asynchronous daily updates, as an alternative to daily standup meetings? If so, how did it go?",
