      "text": "In a sentence in natural language a thing can be referenced. The dictionary defines a &#x27;pronoun&#x27; as<p>&quot;a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse (e.g., I, you ) or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse (e.g., she, it, this ).&quot;<p>In programming we often find that we have &quot;variables with local scope&quot; that are used within a block. They &quot;refer&quot; to other things. In Lisp, for instance, a LET construct will create local variables that disappear on exit:<p>(defun foo (x) (let ((y (first x))) ....<p>in C it might be<p>void foo (x) int y = first(x); ...<p>Here &#x27;y&#x27; is local.<p>Rather than calling these &quot;variables with local scope&quot; I suggest we call them &quot;pronouns&quot;.",
