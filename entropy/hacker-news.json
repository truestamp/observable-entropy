      "text": "Just launched NFT Deals, an auction site for premium NFTs, starting at 99% below floor price with no reserve.<p>This is made possible because the auction’s smart contract takes a fee from each bid – not just the winning bid.<p>The cumulative fees can earn sellers more than the floor price, while the winning bidder gets a huge flip opportunity on the NFT.<p>Whoever holds the “top bid” position for 24 hours will win the NFT – easier said than done because each bid extends the timer by 24 hours.<p>Would love to get your questions, critiques, concerns, and feedback.<p>If you want to participate in the first auction, go here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.nftdeals.xyz&#x2F;auction2&#x2F;0xf2c50dA3C1462873d8604a2E9Dc92FcC6f80924a (you&#x27;ll need Wrapped ETH).",
