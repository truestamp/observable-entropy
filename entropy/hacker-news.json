      "text": "Hey,<p>I&#x27;m a student, who recently finished the second form of education in my country and will participate in an internship around system administration for around 2 months. While I have some experience, running my own server and working with Linux on personal machines for ~4 years, I don&#x27;t know what would be appropriate to revisit&#x2F; learn in preparation for the internship. The company I&#x27;m interning at focuses around managed hosting of webshops, mail and other web applications with GNU&#x2F;Linux.<p>I wanted to tap into the collective knowledge&#x2F; experience of the HN community around internships and how to make the most out them as a learning experience. It would be highly appreciated if you could share some of your tips &amp; tricks around this topic.<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.",
