      "text": "I always prioritized having broad skillset rather than focusing on a single thing, but i&#x27;m now having doubts about it.\nI&#x27;d like to discover if my skills are useful by applying them to solve someone&#x27;s challenges. If talking to me might help you - please drop me an email or schedule a call (the address is in the profile). Free &amp; no strings attached.<p>About me:\n- co-founder&#x2F;ex-CTO&#x2F;ex-CPO of a russian company with $15M arr\n- people usually describe me as a &quot;smart guy&quot;\n- had to solve a problem that required using nlp, so i organized data labelling team, finetuned BERT, and integrated it into a larger system\n- know some finance. unit economy, operating costs, that sort of thing\n- did a lot of a&#x2F;b tests and conversion experiments\n- bitmap indexes, fractal trees, k-d trees - i like indexes and trees\n- developed software using python, golang, php, c++\n- clickhouse user for 3 or 4 years. also, mongodb, vertica, presto\n- did some custdev and qualitative interviews\n- have some experience managing outbound sales reps; but still, i&#x27;m a builder&#x2F;hacker, not a hustler<p>(I realize this post looks a bit like a sneaky &quot;hire me&quot; post - but i assure you, that is not my intention)",
