      "text": "I&#x27;m a software engineer working on exposing frontends and APIs for monolithic backends (that already doe the job).\nI work for an HR company and basically 90% of job is display data coming from those backends.\nSometimes we need to have an orchestration layer. Most of the time is spent on designing APIs.<p>As a student I had always been told that in computing maths are fundamental.<p>Q : As a software engineer in exposing APIs and frontends, have you ever make use of advanced Maths ?
