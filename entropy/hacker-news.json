Some of it went to exchanges though.<p>One is using   REG.RU for both domain registration and nameservers, the other individual is using cloudflare for DNS and nic.ru for the registrar.<p>The YouTube accounts are hacked. They have an unlimited number of them. I dunno where they get the 5-40k concurrent live viewers.<p>This blows any other organized crime away in terms of profitability, scalability, consistency, and most  importantly, not being caught. The same people doing this for years.  Youutbe at this point is a willing accomplice for not doing more.",
