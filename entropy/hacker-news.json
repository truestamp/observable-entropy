      "text": "Do you think that WebAR mass adoption without W3C standard is possible?<p>Hi there, mass adoption of AR &#x2F; mixed reality will be via webAR, when I first took a look at webAr in 2019 I thought we would have aW3C standard b 2020&#x2F;2021 but this is not the case. I´m asking because I want to start a business in the AR&#x2F;XR space, but think that we first need a W3C standard to kick it off. What are your thoughts about that?
