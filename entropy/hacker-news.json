      "text": "I&#x27;m a business analyst doing all data work for some middle man company. Atm, I feel overwhelmed,   one email after the other, demanding me to finish all the reports (all still in dev. stage for this new program). Sometimes I just stare at the screen, I couldn&#x27;t even start anything. And there&#x27;s constant distraction (Ms teams, more emails...).<p>I got assigned to this new program where I have to build all the reports from scratch. I do like building and creating but it just got to a point when it feels overwhelming.<p>When I found out someone else is going revamp eveyrthing I created for the old program I was handling, I felt even more demotivated. No wonder I couldn&#x27;t even finish anything now.<p>I was promised of promotion and wage increase this quarter but now I feel like I wont be getting it as I cannot fulfill the demands anymore.",
