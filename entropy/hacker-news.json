My intuition tells me the architecture is something like: 1) User signs up for the product, 2) A control plane level service launches a new instance of Postgres and configures it (on k8s, Nomad, whatever) 3) The database credentials are provided to user and the control plane handles replication&#x2F;instances&#x2F;etc. Would love any additional reading or resources anyone can provide.",
