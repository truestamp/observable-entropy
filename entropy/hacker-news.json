      "text": "Yesterday I got an SMS 2FA text from my bank for a login attempt that I did not trigger. I changed my password, alerted my bank, and have been checking my account balance every few minutes it seems, but luckily everything seems fine.<p>The experience got me thinking, because the SMS 2FA was seemingly the last defense saving my account from a breach. My bank doesn&#x27;t offer a stronger form of 2FAâ€”neither TOTP nor any form of U2F.<p>Meanwhile, I really love Yubikeys; I have one plugged into every laptop I own (work and personal). I use Touch ID or Face ID on sites I access frequently from mobile.<p>It seems that the one place where U2F would be really impactful is online banking, but I&#x27;ve struggled figuring out which banks support strong 2FA without first creating an account with the bank.<p>Does your bank offer U2F, FIDO2, WebAuthn or any other form of hardware security token mechanism for logins? Have you had otherwise positive or negative experiences with the bank overall?",
