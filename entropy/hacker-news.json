      "text": "Hi all. I&#x27;ve been assessing the feasibility of getting into COBOL&#x2F;CICS development, since this market seems to be really active on my country and I&#x27;m also a bit sick of current trends on software development.<p>However, I&#x27;m having some trouble on finding an opportunity of getting access to a mainframe for practice.<p>Could anyone give me some ideas&#x2F;directions? I totally consider paying for such access, naturally.<p>PS: suggestions&#x2F;advice are welcome as well, as I&#x27;m still just thinking about taking this path. Besides, I think I&#x27;m well aware of what I&#x27;ll eventually encounter in terms of code quality and maintainability -- I&#x27;ve been working with &#x27;older&#x27; languages and legacy projects for some time now and I feel less unhappy this away.",
