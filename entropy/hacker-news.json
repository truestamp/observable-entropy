      "text": "Hello Denizens of Hacker News,  a topic that has been on my mind a lot recently is how to effectively manage technical debt.\nAs a veteran developer who has worked for a variety of companies I have mostly seen tech debt handled poorly, even to the point of developers being penalized by management for not working quickly enough. I wanted to ask… What are the most common types of tech debt you’ve seen in your companies? How do you prioritize dealing with tech debt so that the team stays productive?",

So I decided to post my own affairs.<p>I currently have 50 roles in tech; what I am doing is essentially outsourcing the labor to India, Poland, Nigeria, and Argentina. I am, basically, running an outsourcing company at this stage and have people process and handle requests in those countries and assign engineers. I learned a ton about quality control and am making 7.5M a year. I am able to juggle the work because most of my gigs are in startups and meetings rarely happen so i&#x27;m pretty much running on autopilot.",
