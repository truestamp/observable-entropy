      "text": "Hey HN,<p>does anyone know, how I could enable kinetic scrolling with KDE and libinput, even if it is experimental?<p><i>Sidenote: I know that synaptics[1] and mtrack[2] kind of support Kinetic scrolling, but I would like to go for libinput, since the others showed some issues with my Trackpad and libinput is more future proof.</i><p>I&#x27;m trying to configure my touchpad with Arch-Linux, libinput and KDE to support kinetic scrolling. For those, who don&#x27;t know: Kinetic scrolling does not stop scrolling as soon as the fingers leave the touchpad, but slowly fades out the scrolling process.Libinput works fine so far, but with X11, Kinetic Scrolling is not possible[3]. After checking the docs, I found out that it should be possible with Wayland.<p>KDE and Wayland are still not considered as stable[4], but I got it working for testing purposes. Unfortunately, libinput does not support generic configuration files, but has to be integrated into the Desktop Environment &#x2F; Compositor, and KDE has no config option to enable Kinetic scrolling.<p>It would be awesome, if someone could point me in the right direction on this.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.freedesktop.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=38909<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;p2rkw&#x2F;xf86-input-mtrack&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wayland.freedesktop.org&#x2F;libinput&#x2F;doc&#x2F;latest&#x2F;faqs.html#kinetic-scrolling-does-not-work<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kde.org&#x2F;announcements&#x2F;plasma&#x2F;5&#x2F;5.21.0&#x2F;#kwin-and-wayland",
