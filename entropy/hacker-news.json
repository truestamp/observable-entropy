      "text": "Some context:\nI am in the process of constructing a house. Recently, I contacted a lot of people in areas such as mortgage loan, building contractors, architects. To my surprise, hardly anyone followed up. That implies, they must be getting a lot of work. We could say the same for doctors, lawyers etc.<p>One the other hand, if we look at the software industry, everyone is replaceable no matter how good they are. So how does one become a go-to person?. Not necessarily at work. But outside of work too, so that one doesn&#x27;t have to depend on the employer. I know that having skills in niche areas will help. But then, there will always be a dependency on the employer.  Also, the entry barrier is very low in tech. Anyone could learn any technology.",
