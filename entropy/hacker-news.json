Spot instances are awesome for development work, and on the whole, using Amazon  \nis painless.<p>See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rodgarrison&#x2F;reinvent<p>However, AWS ENA NICs are virtualized. They are not bonafide plugged-into-the-PCI-bus cards. Therefore the data pathway to&#x2F;from the NIC is not direct like it would be at home with the NIC right on the motherboard or in the PCI bus. For a cloud company probably virtualized is the only way to go.<p>Non-virtualized is what I have in mind for the application I have in mind. To that end, anybody know of a decent HW hosting company provides:<p>- Some kind of Xeon based processors\n- regular run of the mill COTS NICs (not virtualized)\n- Bonus: provides or could provide SolarFlare NICs",
