      "text": "I have a technical training (physics and applied math), but spent most of my early career in the military (non-technical roles). I got out of the military and spent the last few years in the startup ecosystem in generalist roles. I&#x27;ve delivered when managing technical projects, can read&#x2F;understand developer documentation pretty well, and frankly just vibe with developers so I want to make the transition into launching my own software projects. I don&#x27;t necessarily want to grind in solitude as a junior dev somewhere to slowly develop my skills - I want to just full bore train in my spare time. Is that the wrong approach? If not, got any tips on where to start?",
