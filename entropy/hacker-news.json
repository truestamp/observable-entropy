      "text": "I’m 27 (almost 28) years old and have heard the horror stories about ageism in hiring especially in the Bay Area where I am located.<p>I am self taught and have a a few years of experience under my belt working a well known non-FAANG company but mainly doing front end work with some relatively light weight backend tasks sprinkled in from time to time.<p>I enjoy the work I do, but am wondering if it will still be a valuable set of skills once I start getting into my late 30s or if I need to start developing serious backend chops to stay relevant.<p>I’m sure it’s not like this everywhere but I have mostly observed younger people working in more fro tend related roles, so I’m wondering if anyone has felt like they needed to switch focuses with age eventually",
