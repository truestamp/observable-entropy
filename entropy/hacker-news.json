      "text": "Hello!<p>I&#x27;m a senior student in uni looking for internships in the food waste&#x2F;insecurity space. Organizations that I think are cool are:\nShelf Engine [1]: offers a software to grocery retailers that helps them plan orders. What I like about them is that Shelf Engine buys back whatever perishables don&#x27;t sell. Their business incentives line with environmental ones.\nmRelief [2]: an NPO that makes it easier for people to access food stamps. Their product is focused and works on existing support structures rather than reinventing the wheel.<p>In general, an org (company or NPO) that offers some product&#x2F;service which helps to reduce food waste or insecurity.<p>A company that fits this bill doesn&#x27;t have to explicitly offer internships, I&#x27;m comfortable asking them. I&#x27;m asking this on HN because I&#x27;m curious about finding orgs that are fairly new and attacking these problems in a smart way.<p>My experience: my previous internships have been as a business analyst, a sales analyst, and a management consultant. I&#x27;m currently a product marketing intern until the end of the year.<p>1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.shelfengine.com&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;\n2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mrelief.com&#x2F;about_us",
