      "text": "Hello, I am working on some compression research. And I was wondering if new compression algorithms can improve overall web experience by improving HTTP compression.<p>Can someone with knowledge of this tell me if HTTP already supports zstd (default is brotli afaik). If it doesn&#x27;t support zstd, why not? zstd offers pretty fast decompression which is useful (you only compress once, but you decompress millions of times).<p>I am working on an AI based compression alg which is very slow at compressing but extremely fast at decompressing. AI has huge scope in lossy compression (considering that AIs can guess pretty well what lossy content human beings can perceive). Any advice for me?",
