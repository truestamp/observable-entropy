So far, I&#x27;ve worn every hat from business development and marketing, to product development, finance and ops. I&#x27;ve made great progress with the help of advisors and contractors without raising any external capital. I have a strong pitch to put in front of investors and growth accelerators (eg Techstars, YC) for a seed round over the next few months.<p>If I can find someone who is the right fit, I would love to bring on a partner to take on the COO role to help me scale and get ready for a raise.",
