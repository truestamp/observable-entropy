Did you find learning techniques that helped when you were still teaching yourself?<p>Fonts, colors, screen readers?<p>I am currently teaching a teenager, it is obvious he understands principles fast and has great memory retention, but syntax is a bit of a problem. We obviously use helpful editors and IDEs in this regard, but it is still an issue.",

      "text": "I just had an idea, I don&#x27;t know if a product like this already exists, if you know something similar or have feedback feel free to tell me please :).<p>It&#x27;s apparently possible to detect which employees are the most likely to quit their jobs using public data and machine learning.<p>So I&#x27;m thinking of making two tools for recruiters:<p>-a saas where you&#x27;d input your criteria(technologies, experience, location etc...), and you&#x27;d get a list of top profiles who are the most likely to quit their current job but who are not yet on the market(or who are never publicly on the market)<p>-a browser extension for linkedin, which would give each profile a score rating how likely they are to quit.<p>I know linkedin have some kind of recommended candidates algorithms, but It seems that tons of recruiters are still wasting their invites&#x2F;inmails on linkedin for a really low conversion rate,\nso I think this might interest some of them, I see people who got hired a month ago and who are still getting spammed.<p>+If you find a candidate quickly, you&#x27;re less likely to pay for inmails, right? So linkedin have much to gain from showing you candidates who look good on paper but who are not that likely to answer, does my train of thought make sense to you?<p>I&#x27;m also maybe thinking of a tool using the same concept but for your own employees, so you can know which employees are likely to quit and really need to get a raise&#x2F;promotion if you want to keep them.<p>Do you think those might be interesting ideas?",
