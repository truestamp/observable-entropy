This table does not support any UPDATE statements, just INSERT and SELECT.<p>I can imagine that there are some optimizations we can make for such tables, since there will never be a case where a row is being updated while another query reads it. Is there a looser transaction isolation we can set? Are there any other optimizations we can do?<p>I understand that the optimizations may depend on the specific database. In that case, I would suggest focusing on Postgres and&#x2F;or MySQL as they are the most common in my experience.",
