      "text": "Hi, long time Linux user here. I&#x27;ve been using Firejail for years to isolate apps from my ~&#x2F;Documents and web browser data, so that there&#x27;s a smaller risk of downloaded binaries like Signal and Steam accessing my private data.<p>Now I&#x27;m thinking of getting a Macbook for the nicer creature comforts. I notice that MacOS apps installed outside the app store have full access to ~&#x2F;Library, which means things like Signal and Steam can freely poke around my web browser cookie files. This seems bad to me.<p>I think these are the options, and none of them work very. Wonder if anyone has better suggestions:<p>1. sandbox-exec [1]: Poorly documented and deprecated. Might go away in upcoming releases of MacOS.<p>2. Create separate user accounts and `sudo su` as them, then execute the binary. This kind of works but some apps give strange results. Firefox seems to lanuch OK, but I can&#x27;t run steam this way. I can download the dmg, run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine &#x2F;path&#x2F;Steam.dmg` then run it, the auto updater shows up, and then it closes itself without launching the store UI. If I double click as the `sudo`ed account normally, it runs fine.<p>Also apps launched with `sudo` don&#x27;t show up when I run the app switcher with Command-Tab, not sure why.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmmv.dev&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;macos-sandbox-exec.html",
