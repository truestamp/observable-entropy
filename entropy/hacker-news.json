      "text": "So, for the last 8 or 9 years, I&#x27;ve offered prospective employers a 20% discount on salary if I can work 4 days a week instead of 5. I usually go with start-ups because they&#x27;re under pressure to hire top-talent but skimp on costs (i.e. they want to offer below-market costs but have trouble justifying why), and they&#x27;re usually flexible enough to not have a HR policy etched in stone against this kind of flexibility. It also usually takes some sort of warming-up to the idea and a whole pitching and easing process to get it (so I&#x27;ll work 5 days for the first few months), but it usually works out in the end.<p>I make everything sound like it&#x27;s economics while discussing it, but I actually get 1000x more enjoyment out of my work and non-work lives under this time-split. There&#x27;s some stigma around &#x27;lazy&#x27; and &#x27;work ethic&#x27; that I usually have to get around, but these are the ideal parameters for me to produce the most sustainably, and keep motivation up sustainably. So I figured this is just my weird quirk... valuing free time over money so much that I do something about it.<p>Recently, though, I&#x27;ve been interviewing candidates for some open tech positions and found a surprising number of them asking for the same thing in some form or another.<p>So I&#x27;m starting to wonder:<p>* Are there lots and lots of us that value free time over money, and there&#x27;s just such a tight cultural stigma (even in our high-earning industry) around discussing it, so no one does?<p>* Are there lots and lots of us that have already instituted something like this with our employers&#x2F;clients under some sort of &quot;keep this between us&quot; understanding? One of the larger companies I worked for, I was told to tell everyone that my day off was a day of &#x27;focused work-from-home&#x27; out of fear that others might ask for something similar.<p>I&#x27;m just wondering what your experiences are, and if this is a weird niche quirk, or actually a cultural shift :)",
