      "text": "So recently I thought of the Cussen Test, it&#x27;s one converse of the Turing Test.  The Turing Test was created by Alan Turing as a target, basically, like what he wanted his AI to be able to do.  He must have wanted more later, but it&#x27;s a very well-defined milestone.  It is not final, however.  And the purpose is to allow him to exist in a world that didn&#x27;t tolerate him, by chemically castrating him for instance, but it wasn&#x27;t just homosexuality it was also how different he was.  And that world was dominated by humans.  So the AI researcher creates a bot that passes for a human, which believe it or not is more viable than adapting so he himself passes as human.<p>What&#x27;s the Cussen Test?  Similar, so it&#x27;s for AI researchers in a world dominated by bots.  The algorithm.  The Matrix, basically.  The goal is to get an human on the other end of the line, strictly through the same medium as the Turing Test, digital text.  This post is a Cussen Test.",
