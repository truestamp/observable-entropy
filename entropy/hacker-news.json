      "text": "I am single and make decent money, enough to not worry about monthly budget. However, even I have noticed how little I am able to get for the same money. Only few years ago I would be hauling 4-5 bags back home for $30, now it&#x27;s barely 2 bags. Milk has gone from $2 to $5. Rents are easily near $3k. I have found myself not buying lot of things I used to buy, less eating out, less random stuff&#x2F;gadgets, less travelling...less of everything.<p>But what are people doing who are making around 70k.. They are already on budget. I can&#x27;t see how current govt will win next election, silent majority has heavily been hurt and pretty sure they will take it out in elections.<p>Inflation and housing prices&#x2F;rents are basically killing this country. I personally know few immigrants who left because despite their humble living standard they are unable to save anything anymore to make their time worth it here.<p>I am no economist, but I have this gut feeling, this is it. Economy has cracked. Remember seeing great depression photos? That feels like the next few decades. Maybe I&#x27;m hungry and being pessimistic or maybe it&#x27;s as dim as I feel it.",
