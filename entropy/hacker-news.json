Created in 2007, it has since grown (as of 16&#x2F;01&#x2F;2022) to a \ntotal of 1,492 tasks, some of which are trivial, and some fiendishly difficult. One programming \nlanguage now (at last) has submissions for all of them, and it is one you have probably never \nheard of: [[http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rosettacode.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:Phix Phix]]<p>Phix is a zero-dependency (though you will almost certainly want to install IUP on Linux) 31.5MB \ndownload, with extensive help files and over 1000 bundled demos (~100 of which are win32-only), \nwhich can recompile itself (full sources included, naturally) in under 20 seconds. The only real\ndownside is that most of the runtime is written using inline x86 assembly, so it won&#x27;t run on\n(eg) arm devices.<p>While Phix is primarily a desktop programming language, with versions for Windows and Linux, it \ncomes bundled with p2js which can transpile most programs to JavaScript so they can be run in a\nweb browser. Naturally certain activities such as such as reading and writing disk files are\nnot permitted in a web browser due to security considerations, however of those 1,492 tasks, \n734 or 49% have been marked as js compatible, with just 82 or 6% marked as incompatible, and \nobviously the remaining 45% are as yet unclassified.",
