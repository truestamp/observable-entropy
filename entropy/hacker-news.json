      "text": "I&#x27;ve read through the MacBook threads and there seem to have been repeating questions: which specs to go for in the new MacBooks. I figured it might be worth it to make a dedicated post to discuss this.<p>To start this off, consider the following scenario:<p>- 50% of my work is web or mobile app development<p>- another 50% is training ML and deep learning models \n(currently on a cluster, but I&#x27;d prefer do it on my notebook of course)<p>- I also do light music or photo editing work, as a hobby, as well as some design in Figma<p>In this case, what specs would you choose for your Mac? Specifically:<p>- M1 Pro with [14, 16] GPU cores, [8, 10] CPU cores, and [16, 32] GB of unified memory<p>- M1 Max with [24, 32] GPU cores, 10 CPU cores, and [32, 64] GB of unified memory",
