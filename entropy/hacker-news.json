It used to have:\n- showcases of beautifully designed websites\n- articles about design\n- discussion\nThe website is still up and it does have daily activity: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.designernews.co&#x2F;\nBut what you’ll find is the quality has dropped massively and the community is barely there.<p>Is there some other website where the showcases and the discussion have gone to? I used to discover stuff like the website of a rural law firm that somehow had an incredible design and I’d love to find the magic again.",
