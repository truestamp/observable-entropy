      "text": "I need to build a simple website to share a project that I have, that evolves around advocating for some social change, and involves open source code.<p>My initial thought was to use a simple website builder like Wix or squarespace, and include a forum plugin to try and create a community.<p>The main reason I thought about this instead of wordpress is because I do not want the hassle of having to update the code every now and then. These website builders are very secure, as far as I know.<p>However, I stumbled upon the option of hosting a static website on github pages, using jekyll, and using github discussions as a forum.<p>Can anyone opine on whether that&#x27;s a good idea? Specifically, can I be very confident that there is no security flaw, and that I have no requirement to update my code, as long as it&#x27;s hosted on github pages?<p>Any advice and comment welcome, thanks!",
