      "text": "Vector Search Engines are powering the the next generation of search. Instead of relying on things like BM25 or TF-IDF representations, we use neural representations to compare semantic similarity. Dot products to calculate the similarity between all vectors would be very time consuming. Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW) are a cutting-edge new algorithm used by Weaviate to speed up this search. This podcast explores HNSW, Neurosymbolic search and filtering, and many more!",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Firefox for a while now, but I have some issues with it:<p>1. I  need to switch to chrome for various products such as Google Meet (works on Firefox, but I ran into performance (call quality) issues).<p>2. I often find sites with bad support for Firefox, and I need to again open a second browser (usually Chrome) to check them out.<p>3. It seems that in the past... long time, they have a talent of making Firefox worst. I still like it if it wasn&#x27;t for the other 2 issues, but who can tell in 1 year.<p>Due to the above I was looking for a browser (one, I don&#x27;t like having multiple on my machine but not sure if the Google Meet performance upgrade is just in Chrome or Chromium) which is as fast as Firefox, has a nice UI and preferably a bit more privacy oriented (not much, just a bit more).<p>Any ideas? (Currently checking out Vivaldi, but read a lot about performance issues + I don&#x27;t really like the default UI yet).",
