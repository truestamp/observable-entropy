      "text": "I sold some shares and now I have ~20k USD extra. I&#x27;m in my 30s and I have been programming for about 5 years, and I&#x27;m kind of bored of the daily grind. I can&#x27;t imagine spending another 5 years crushing Jira tickets or doing code reviews.<p>I have been working on building mobile apps to tackle problems I&#x27;m passionate about solving, and teaching myself as much as possible, and I feel comfortable now with building web&#x2F;mobile apps, backend services, and I understand a bit about cloud providers and navigating AWS&#x2F;GCP. I also been reading books through the pandemic on design and product management, and also learned to use various tools like Figma and notion to organize.<p>How can I best utilize my 20k and do something meaningful with that amount this year? I don&#x27;t know any 1st hand connections&#x2F;friends who own their own software business, so I want to ask here.<p>Should I use that amount to register a business, so that I can release apps under that entity?<p>Should I use that amount to hire a professional designer to build landing&#x2F;product page so I can focus on building the app&#x2F;service and talking to potential users?<p>Should I move to the bay area or another big city center? Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have any software engineer friends in my area as I work remote..<p>Please help me out, I need some inspiration and advice. Thank you.",
