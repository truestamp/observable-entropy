      "text": "I&#x27;m in my low thirties and have been working in tech for little over a decade now, five years at my current company. I am also completely over my current job, in fact, even thinking about it makes me anxious to the point of having the eventual panic attack (You can guess how productive I have been in the recent past).<p>I would like to quit my position, take some time to sort a few things in my life (probably less than six months) and eventually get back to working in the industry. I am, however, afraid that this empty space on my curriculum would be very badly perceived by future employers.<p>To the people who have taken a career break, have you had issues when applying to a new position after your break was over? And to the recruiters out there, do you view these breaks in a bad light?",
