      "text": "Hey guys. I&#x27;ve been lurking for a while. It seems to me there&#x27;s a few different demographics that post to HN. A significant minority seems to be FAAMG employees.<p>With all the controversy surrounding these companies (TPM for W11, Apple&#x27;s CSAM, Google&#x27;s everything), I often wonder what recourse anyone has. The arguments made by these companies seems to be that they collect information consensually given to them in exchange for access to their services.<p>My question is, would it be ethical to scour HN and collect a list of profiles which have (of their own volition) claimed employment at FAAMG? I don&#x27;t think a FAAMG employee could claim otherwise, but I would love to see everyone&#x27;s opinions.<p>If the explicit aggregation of this data was ethical, at what point would acting on that data become unethical?",
