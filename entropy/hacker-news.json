      "text": "Hi HN!<p>I wrote a tool that partially encrypts files based on the presence of a HEREDOC.<p>Check it out:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;higgins&#x2F;privatize<p>When added to a git repo, it will automatically transparently encrypt&#x2F;decrypt files you want privatized.<p>For example if you configured your repo to privatize the file `example.txt`, you could write:<p><pre><code>    ```\n    Today I a burrito.\n    &lt;&lt;PRIVATE\n    I was on the toilet for hours.\n    PRIVATE\n    I got a lot of reading done.\n    ```\n</code></pre>\nbut when git-commit&#x27;ed would become:<p><pre><code>    ```\n    Today I a burrito.\n    &lt;&lt;PRIVATE\n    xuJ0fld2vmNWaVLogTIufmWsiFso\n    PRIVATE\n    I got a lot of reading done.\n    ```\n</code></pre>\nDiffing works as you expect (on the unencrypted source) and only those with the `privatize` symmetric key would be able to unlock and decrypt these files.<p>Why did I do this?<p>I keep a public log of what I plan to accomplish and what I&#x27;m working on both personally&#x2F;professionally.\nAt the end of the day, I write a summary of everything that happened.\nNaturally, there are some details of my life that should be kept private (details of too-be-launched projects, sensitive family events, etc).<p>It&#x27;s helpful for me to track everything in one file so as to keep the day&#x27;s context together.<p>Would love to know what you think!\nJustin",
