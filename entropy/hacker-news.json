Therefore, I report these contents, but generally, I receive a reply like &quot;the post was reviewed, and though it doesn&#x27;t go against one of our specific Community Standards, you did the right thing by letting us know about it.&quot;.\nI would like to know about your experience on reporting content on Facebook that you understand as inappropriate.",
