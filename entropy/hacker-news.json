      "text": "Hi HN, Mwangi here. Allow me to interest you in my startup NimoBricks, where we intend to build a user engagement infrastructure for the internet.<p>Let me expand on this a little more. Without users, a majority of mobile apps fizzle out. The best way to keep users is to build tools that provide means for them to engage. Building such tools, however, often take considerable time and investment.<p>NimoBricks proposes to prebuild such tools, allowing developers to plug and play within their current infrastructure with minimal changes in their workflow.<p>We are still refining our approach, and it will be nice to get some feedback. Here is a short survey that will go a great way in pointing us in the right direction -&gt; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3edxeIQ<p>Find our growing waitlist here (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nimobricks.com&#x2F;) if you are interested in what we are building.<p>We have a long way to go, but we couldn&#x27;t be more excited.",
