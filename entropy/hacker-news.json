      "text": "I worked really hard on two side projects during the pandemic that I am quite proud of (here you can take a peak if you like): www.hopupon.com, www.audiobookmate.com<p>When I was younger I used to list side projects on my cv and employers used to take notice. I find now they don&#x27;t seem to care, usually are only interested in employment history and tech tests.<p>I also wonder whether side projects speak to the fact that you&#x27;re not concerned enough with your employer&#x27;s bottom line. I remember when Ken Cosgrove, in Mad Men, had a side gig as an author and got published in a magazine. Roger Sterling  told him, quite sternly, he had to choose between the job and the gig.<p>The thing is I would actually appreciate if a potential employer asked me about the above two projects. I think they demonstrate some of my skills and would be interesting to discuss.<p>What do you guys think: Do you guys still list your side projects? What about for jobs more senior than senior developer?",
