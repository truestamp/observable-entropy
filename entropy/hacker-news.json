      "text": "Had a firewall issue that temporarily affected port 25 but was not identified for just over 24 hours.  In the process of resolving, a test message was sent from a yahoo account to the domain in question.<p>Yahoo sent an &#x27;unable to deliver message after multiple retries, giving up&#x27; message after exactly three hours.<p>Three hours is exceedingly short and my understanding has always been that mail is re-tried for a number of days with a backoff algorithm controlling how often.<p>Is this now common? I am left to wonder how much mail was lost for good during this outage because others have also taken the Yahoo approach.<p>RFC 5321 suggests:<p>Retries continue until the message is transmitted or the sender gives up; the give-up time generally needs to be at least 4-5 days.  It MAY be appropriate to set a shorter maximum number of retries for non-delivery notifications and equivalent error messages than for standard messages. The parameters to the retry algorithm MUST be configurable.",
