      "text": "We&#x27;ve applied for YC for this upcoming batch, and have currently been talking to angels &#x2F; pre-seed investors in the event we don&#x27;t get in.<p>We currently have the ability to accept a $250K SAFE note with no discount&#x2F;cap, but with a MFN clause. We&#x27;ve been told that SAFE notes with MFN clauses are now very common across a number of angels &#x2F; earlier-stage funding sources. (For those that don&#x27;t know what that means, an MFN clause basically says that the $250K will convert at the same discount&#x2F;cap as any subsequent SAFE that has better terms.)<p>Does this mean if we accept the investment, and then get into YC, we would be giving up at least 21% of our company? (Because the $250K note gets the same terms as YC&#x27;s $125K for 7%.)<p>That seems like a huge amount to give up, since we&#x27;ll probably lose another 25% equity during our seed round, meaning we&#x27;ll only have ~50% of the company left after just our seed round.<p>Am I looking at this right or am I missing something? Doesn&#x27;t that mean anyone wanting to go through YC shouldn&#x27;t raise any money that come with an MFN clause (which seems to be super common these day)?<p>The investors unfortunately can&#x27;t invest without the MFN clause (it&#x27;s standard), can&#x27;t wait for 2 months for us to find out YC results, and can&#x27;t invest any less than $250K.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts on how to think about this. I might be crazy, but I&#x27;m leaning towards turning down the funding in the event that we do get into YC.",
