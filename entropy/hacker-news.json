      "text": "Hi everybody, this is a new account. Looking to stay anonymous.<p>I am in tech, software developer. I work a regular full-time job, I am a manager with a team and we work on client projects. The team stays fairly consistent and what changes are the client projects.<p>Recently I started doing some freelance programing to be able to pay some small debts (in about 3 to 4 months I will have paid everything at my current rate). I a have a family. It will grow in about 9 months and I feel I need to save some cash for when that time comes.<p>I work early in the morning on freelance (4am til 5am). Go to the gym (5 to 7) and then commute to my office (around 30 mins commute). During lunch I am able to put 1 more hour to freelance and then at night I would like to be able to at least have 1 more hour of work to organize things for the next day.<p>I do not drink coffee past 1PM to avoid disrupting my sleep at night. I eat a balanced diet. I am slim, I do not drink sugary sodas or things with added sugar (juices, etc).<p>What I want is to be able to work a bit more till 9pm. No more.<p>Is there something I could supplement, drink, or eat, that will allow me to not feel so tired at night? I know that I am putting myself in a situation that might burn me. I am just looking for something that will not have such an impact on my night sleep.<p>By the end of the day I feel my interest in work, or will to do something is completely depleted. I do not feel any motivation to do anything.<p>So any tips, or recommendations, that would help me be motivated and some what energized will be greatly appreciated :thanks:.<p>[edit:] added Ask HN: to title and change the question to keep it under the limit.",
