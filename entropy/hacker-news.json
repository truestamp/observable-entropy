      "text": "For those with parents&#x2F;dependents who may not be technically savvy and have iOS devices, how do you manage their (parents&#x27;) iOS devices remotely?<p>I&#x27;d like to know about (MDM) solutions that can be used to install or remove specific apps, change settings on the device, etc., and their limitations. I know that MDM is what&#x27;s needed here and that a specific MDM profile has to be installed first, but I&#x27;m not sure what privacy preserving options exist and how they fit in on ease of use, features, price, etc. I&#x27;ve read that Apple Configurator on the Mac is terrible and buggy (this seems to be a theme with any Apple app that allows reviews on the respective stores). I don&#x27;t know if a third party solution like JAMF is good for such individual (one or two devices) scenarios where the usage would be occasional. Something that&#x27;s free would be nice.<p>Of course, this need is not restricted to parents alone. It could be for anyone who may have difficulty in understanding or following instructions.",
