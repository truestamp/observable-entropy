For many years, I never cared to change this setting but recently I&#x27;ve attended some concerts and tried different frame rates and resolutions. I decided to go with 60 FPS and 1080p (I don&#x27;t have any 4K devices). However since the switch I think it&#x27;s taking longer to send videos to others.<p>I am trying to find the optimal setting in terms of quality, storage space and sharing with others.",
