In the last 12 months number of new customers stayed relatively the same while in pandemic increased from 50&#x2F;month to 100&#x2F;month.<p>Nothing was changed on our side and customers don&#x27;t seem to go to competition.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s just churn catching up or it&#x27;s something caused by the economy (inflation, recession fears) since our main customers are very small online businesses thus my post here, maybe i&#x27;m not the only one.",
