      "text": "For the unaware, uBlacklist [0] is a browser extension that lets you blacklist sites from the google search results page. It lets you blacklist sites right from the results page, by regex, or by linking lists hosted somewhere.<p>The low quality of results has been a problem from a while now and has become worse lately thanks to all those StackOverflow and Github clones. So I was wondering if we could come together and contribute to a single blacklist hosted somewhere and then import it into each of our browsers. Who knows? We might end up improving the quality of the results we all get.<p>Lists to get rid of the StackOverflow and Github clones already exist. [1]<p>I would love to contribute to a project like this, but won&#x27;t be able to be a maintainer due to time constraints. Would greatly appreciate it if someone could host this.
