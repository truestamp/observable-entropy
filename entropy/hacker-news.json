The job search has been unsatisfactory so far, and I sense that employers might be looking for cheaper alternatives available locally instead of sponsoring a visa or taking on the risk of foreign workers. Despite my experience, how can I best indicate that I can take less salary, provide a higher ROI for them?<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any advice. Thanks",

A fundamental curiosity in my heart is, after tens years of development, can the bottom layer of the common-users-accessible database still develop?<p>JoinBase, is my initial answer to this question.<p>1. For the first time, it proposes the evolution of the database from the user&#x27;s point of view.<p>New tech concepts such as cloud navtive, or HTAP or datalake are no longer encouraged to be consumed. What users want may be just a easy-to-use, efficient data tool that fits.<p>2. For the first time, it well supports three DB payload types in a single engine of a free industrial-grade database: TP single row transcation write, TP and AP read.<p>If you don&#x27;t need complex transcation, it can meet almost of your needs in the domain.<p>3. For the first time, it is so fast that for most businesses, it is no longer necessary to use a distributed database for their data needs.<p>Any suggestions, questions and comments are welcome. I answer online.",
