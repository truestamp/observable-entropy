      "text": "It seems iPhone 64GB storage is not ideal anymore. Twitter app size is 168.7 MB, I’m a mobile app programmer too and my largest app size I remember is barely only 10 MB and that includes SDKs for error monitoring and analytics. LinkedIn size is almost 300 MB. What the hell? I kept digging all the different engineering blogs and I can’t seem to find any company addressing this mobile app size issue? Your users are not all in Silicon Valley, majority are in Asia. Have some respect. At least give us an option to delete cache.",
