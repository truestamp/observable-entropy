      "text": "Just curious about this, as I ran into this problem recently.<p>Say I have two bank accounts, both of which are solely mine. I want to move a small amount (say &lt;$1000) a close to instantly as possible, avoiding the time sink that is ACH. Fees are ok, but it should involve only yourself and your accounts, so no exchanging with other people.<p>My first thought was to use PayPal, load my balance from one card, and withdraw it to another. However, PayPal seems to not let you add to your balance with a debit card, only from a bank account, which involves and ACH transaction. You can for some reason, withdraw your balance to a debit card for a small fee.<p>The way I ended up getting to work was to load the money into my Apple Pay wallet, and then withdraw it into the other account, all through debit cards. This does carry a fee and Comes with the caveat of not working for very small amounts (&lt;$10).<p>It got me thinking though, why is this such an issue. There are plenty of methods to do quick, p2p or retail transactions without resorting to ACH, why is is such a pain to move money between my own accounts.",
