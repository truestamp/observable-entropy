      "text": "A while a go I needed to use a GPU enabled computer to run some deep-learning models. I used AWS (naturally) and all was good except the price and performance was not great. I then had to use more GPU compute and didn&#x27;t want to use AWS or GCP. I also didn&#x27;t need the latest and greatest GPU specs. I found a solution that is affordable and with good performance. I am now thinking there might be other people with a need for GPU compute but not at AWS prices. People who dont have the skills to build the hw&#x2F;sw set up but do need machine learning compute capabilities. Over to you HN? Does this resonate with anyone?",
