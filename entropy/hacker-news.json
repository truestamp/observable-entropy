      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a developer at a pretty major American defence company (though i&#x27;m from and based in England) for around 3 years (2 years as a graduate&#x2F;mid level developer, 1 year as a senior). They&#x27;ve been alright, for learning, have a ton of on hands experience with AWS&#x2F;Kubernetes&#x2F;messaging systems&#x2F;multiple languages, but they don&#x27;t really pay to the going market rate for a senior developer in the UK.<p>I&#x27;m looking at applying elsewhere and I have ambitions to move to one of the larger tech companies. I applied to one of the major startup fin-tech companies in the UK not too long ago, interview process went pretty well, got to stage 5&#x2F;6 and did very well in technical discussions (discussed messaging systems, transaction integrity with multiple approaches etc), however fell short in the programming task (a program heavily focused on a certain aspect of programming, something I didn&#x27;t have a massive amount of experience with so got tripped up when trying to convey the intricate details of what exactly the program was doing, though it was completely functional).<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve improved massively in that part of my skill set, however it has left me with a feeling&#x2F;fear that I could apply to another company and face the same problem of getting tripped up by a single thing where my knowledge isn&#x27;t up to scratch, despite my pretty abundant knowledge in other areas. Is this something commonly experienced and if so what can remedy it?",
