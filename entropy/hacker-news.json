      "text": "We had about 4-5% monthly churn for like 3 years and this year it increased about 20-40% to 6-7%. In the last 12 months number of new customers stayed relatively the same while in pandemic increased from 50&#x2F;month to 100&#x2F;month.<p>Nothing was changed on our side and customers don&#x27;t seem to go to competition.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s just churn catching up or it&#x27;s something caused by the economy (inflation, recession fears) since our main customers are very small online businesses thus my post here, maybe i&#x27;m not the only one.",

      "text": "A friend of mine has taken over a legacy (20+ years) 100+ microservices application. And it is an absolute nightmare. The complexity of building and deploying it is the worst I have ever seen. 10x worse than then worst monolith I have ever worked with. Debugging is a nightmare. Synchronisation issues makes auto testing almost impossible. The only good thing is that all the microservices are written in the same programming language. Imagine if 5+ different languages and build systems were used instead? The complexity would have been out of this world.<p>What is your nightmare experience with microservices?",
