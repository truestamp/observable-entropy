It seems to me there aren&#x27;t other compact ways to represent a graph in text mode. In 2D&#x2F;3D graphs are represented with connected nodes, but when there are too many nodes the result is very cluttered. The most similar presentation in text mode is the directory tree, but it isn&#x27;t compact, the list will grow vertically.",

Reading all over the web, I can say that I have ~ 100% of the symptoms since I was a child: inattentive, daydreamer, unable to follow instructions given, etc. All my teachers in my childhood always complained that I was never paying attention to classes. \nUnless it is REALLY REALLY important (like to turn off the stove), I often forget something I was asked to do if I don&#x27;t take note. Man I&#x27;m just shocked, that I didn&#x27;t have any clue, my whole life, that this was actually a mental condition.<p>Since I&#x27;m now WFH, In my dayly job I&#x27;m just learning to take notes of everything in meetings, because that already lead me to a lot of problems in the nearly past.",
