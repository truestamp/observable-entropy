      "text": "I was browsing through vercels docs when I noticed that password protecting [1] a project (so that anyone previewing a deployment needs a password) is an optional add on feature for (an insane?) $150 per month. A pro plan is $20 per month per member [2] and it just makes me curious who this works out as desirable for? For small teams paying an extra $1800 per year for a feature that&#x27;s maybe a few hours of dev time to implement doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. Even for large teams where a feature leak might be disastrous, they might be concerned enough to want their own implementation. Is there something technical I&#x27;m missing here that would be difficult (or impossible) to reproduce? I&#x27;m mostly curious because I&#x27;d think the economics of it would lean toward a smaller price tag; as for most teams this probably means ~doubling their costs if they wanted to use it.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vercel.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;projects&#x2F;overview#password-protection<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vercel.com&#x2F;pricing",
