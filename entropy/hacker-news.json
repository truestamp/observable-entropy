      "text": "I am a senior software engineer who has been in the field for about 25 years. I mainly use Python and SQL and feel like I can use it to solve mostly all problems. I also have a good knowledge of programming techniques like functional, OO and logic programming. I am aware that as a senior software engineer one has to have other skills like caring about the team overall, and mentoring juniors.\nI am wondering what should I learn next. Somebody said I should learn Go or Rust but I feel like if it’s another programming language, its really nothing new. Spend a weekend, do some tutorials and you should be good since you are a senior engineer and you know the basics that underpin programming languages.<p>What novel thing should I learn next that will enhance my capability as a senior engineer? Or open to my eyes to things that I haven’t considered till now?<p>I realize this is a vague request but was just wondering if there were other people with the same dilemma.<p>Thanks in advance!",
