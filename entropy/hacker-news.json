      "text": "Hi, when I started to work remotely I was looking for ways to keep in touch with my colleagues on the not work-related stuff. As someone who loves sport and gets motivation from other people, I built an app called Spurr for teams to run asynchronous challenges. For example, you can run 500 miles together, do 10,000 pushups, 100 minutes of plank, etc… or design your own challenge based on your unique team culture. It&#x27;s just a bit of fun and next time on Zoom I have a great small talk topic with people who are in my challenge.<p>How do you keep in touch with your colleagues while working remotely? Do you not have fatigue from Zoom events? Thanks for any feedback!",
