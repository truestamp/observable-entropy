      "text": "Enterprise and startups are mostly using C# and Java. Some are using python (DRF) for their core, however Node are mostly used for small services and not as a main choice.<p>With the latest post about Remix (and all stuff that has been happening in JS&#x2F;TS world), I think Nestjs is also a solid choice on building scalable applications as a core of a startup. For the past few years it has been gaining tractions and many sponsors, going to the right direction as well.<p>Has anyone ever used NestJS for their side project that went off? What are the challenges that you get?<p>I&#x27;m trying it out for my next project",
