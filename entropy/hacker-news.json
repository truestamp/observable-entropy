      "text": "Last year, my cheap HP mouse started giving me a huge amount of pain in the arm. It was tiny and I had a really poor grip on it most of the times (I have long fingers).<p>So, I started searching for a replacement. My criteria were that the new mouse should be ergonomic, large and wired. I scoured the review sites, shopping sites, the whole shebang.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find a single mouse that fits all the criteria. Hence the question.<p>P.S.<p>1. I eventually bought a wireless mouse, an ASUS MW203. It is reasonably large and it has helped reduce my pain a lot. But sadly, I couldn&#x27;t get my hands on it&#x27;s mythical wired version.<p>2. It is surprisingly hard to find a large mouse in the sea of compact and portable (read: small) ones.<p>3. I prefer going wired when it comes to electronics and stuff. They are easy to repair and disengage (you just have to pull the wire). It is just a preference and not a crusade against wireless devices.",
