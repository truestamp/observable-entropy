Now my question is do folks know of any such private caches in use (commerical or open source) as I can sense a lot of webapps today can be made faster with an &quot;unshared&quot; or per user cache e.g cache with user specific keys and cookies such that its purely a per user cache. It sounds like something on the user&#x27;s machine , correct?",
