      "text": "Hi HN, curious if I could solicit feedback on a landing page we&#x27;ve created (this is a project we&#x27;re looking to OS in the next 2 weeks but looking for beta testers). The project is an IDE&#x2F;workbench we&#x27;ve been building from our learnings building deep learning models at scale (the tldr is taking a lot of the concepts of Jupyter notebooks and helping integrate that in to a cohesive IDE to productionize models faster).<p>Goal of the page: get users to sign up for a beta release of the platform.<p>The page can be found here: www.cnext.io<p>Thank you in advance for any feedback you all might have (good, bad, indifferent - all is appreciated). If any of you are interested in learning more about the project as well please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out.",
