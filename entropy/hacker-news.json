There seems to be quite a lot of interest in this right now, between Angular elements, Webpack 5 with Module Federation, single-spa etc.<p>Im just curious if anyone has actually implemented it, what you learned from building out, what approach you took and would you do it the same way again?<p>Also any great articles out there for it?<p>Thanks!",
