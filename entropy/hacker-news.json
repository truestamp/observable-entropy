      "text": "I have created a desktop app that can create short and engaging videos for your product&#x2F;website.<p>You just enter a website and select a template with animations. Or can animate anything on page.<p>Example of how to make a video:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;talevideo.wistia.com&#x2F;medias&#x2F;r7qmbljyhx<p>More video examples: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hey_sergei&#x2F;status&#x2F;1469041478437687298<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hey_sergei&#x2F;status&#x2F;1477983425462218753<p>Key features:<p>- no need to do screen recording<p>- always up-to-date content, you can re-export video with same effect if text on site changed.<p>- select and animate any element on a page<p>- record and replay mouse&#x2F;keyboard actions.<p>Everyone loves a good video. The problem is that creating a product video can be hard, especially if you’re not a professional.<p>That&#x27;s why I plan to add much more templates with wizard steps to make nice videos even when you don&#x27;t know from where to begin.<p>It&#x27;s still an early beta version and not everything is smooth and has bugs, and not easy as I want it to be.<p>But I really want to hear feedback.\nWhat do you think?<p>[Link] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talevideo.com",
