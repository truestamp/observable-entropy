      "text": "What I&#x27;ve been wanting for a long time for my tech notes:<p>- taking notes easily, preferably markdown (love its simplicity and I seem to remember it pretty well, maybe from stackoverflow&#x27;s training)\n- must be available everywhere, I don&#x27;t want to sync folders over dropbox or stuff like that across my computers, tablets and phones... it should be hosted maybe on AWS and be available as soon as I type my domain (even public would be fine)\n- must be simple to edit (with a password at this point, no public editing :P) to add pages\n- must be simple to add images (cut&#x2F;paste and&#x2F;or drag and drop) on the document\n- there must be a quicksearch (something like I start typing and immediately full-text search into the documents appear below with a small preview of the paragraph where my text was found)<p>I tried text markdown files + grep -&gt; good but no sync across devices, no images (markdown files can&#x27;t display that directly, I have to store the images somewhere and link to them, that&#x27;s a lot of work without a 3rd party program)\nI tried google docs -&gt; good but search is terrible, plus a lot of formatting complexity since it wasn&#x27;t created for tech notes (text + images&#x2F;graphs)\nI tried dropbox -&gt; same issues as above, plus install stuff everywhere. Hate it.<p>So here I am asking again, maybe I&#x27;ll be more lucky this time: is there a preferably opensource software (or combination of softwares) that will allow me to have simple tech notes in markdown with fulltext responsive search + extremely quick edit of whatever I&#x27;m seeing + web access from any device + paste images directly in those rendered MD files?<p>It&#x27;s a VERY simple tool but since my memory is gradually failing (getting old), I&#x27;m looking for a way to have my knowledge, coding tips and snippets, programming guides, graphs, linux commands and stuff like that all at a glance at my fingertips.<p>Sorry for asking again something that has probably been asked a thousand times. As I said: I&#x27;m getting old :P",
