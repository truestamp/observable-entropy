She also attached a tweet about a YC email to all their founders, here’s the link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;refsrc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1527238287471292417. I checked the company webpage and in fact they have closed all the open positions, there were like 6.<p>From all the rejections I’ve got so far this is the first time the reason is markets turmoil &#x2F; recession threat. To be honest is my first time job hunting since I graduated in 2019.<p>Screen shots: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.co&#x2F;wSx5IR44nK<p>Will be this the situation for most tech companies or just start ups? I know the unprofitable over valuated ones will most likely get rekt first but I wanna know if during recessions recruiting slows down even for big profitable companies.<p>What companies or roles will be more resilient?<p>And how as a SWE &#x2F; tech industry professional, specially the ones starting their careers like me, can prepare?<p>I hope some experienced people in the industry can give some hope and advice. Is demoralizing to find out I spent 4 years in school just to get into a really harsh job market. First pandemic, then recession? F...",

It&#x27;s very hard to search in this space because you&#x27;re inevitably met with Javascript solutions aiming to template HTML.
