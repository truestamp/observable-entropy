Boot camps, online courses, freelancing, and GitHub contributions are some of the options I can pursue. Any comments on the pros and cons of each of the solutions above?",

I&#x27;ve since moved on to other projects, and am looking to see if anyone wants to take over the project, or remix it into something entirely new.<p>The code is open-source and can be found here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sethkimmel3&#x2F;roundtable.audio&#x2F;. I&#x27;m planning to shut down the current deployment at the end of the year if no one wants it.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, feel free to reach out! I&#x27;d be happy to spend some time intro&#x27;ing you to the codebase and can give you some technical and commercial ideas for how to extend it.",
