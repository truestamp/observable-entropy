I was curious about that organization and went to check it out (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DROPCitizenShip) and the link on their profile is pointing to a very weird scam site...? you will only see the scam once, when you visit the first time, every other visit so far produced a simple looking landing page. Did I drink too much tea today or why does this seem so off to me?",
