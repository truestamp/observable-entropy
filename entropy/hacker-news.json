I&#x27;m good at what I do, have some pretty specialized and hard to find knowledge and so far am loving the new set of skills I need to develop and refine.  But I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know and think maybe a coach would be a Good Thing.  Maybe not ready for Alan Weiss himself, but somebody who can help me up my game.  Any ideas for me?  Thanks!",
