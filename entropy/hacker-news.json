      "text": "Hello again HN, It&#x27;s Joe and JD from Hydra (YC W22)(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hydras.io&#x2F;).<p>In spirit of Postgres, we’re building a data warehouse that&#x27;s accessible to every developer. The cool thing is that you can swap the storage&#x2F;compute between Postgres, Snowflake, and BiqQuery(coming soon), and Postgres queries keeps working. There’s no need to change your app code to use Snowflake and BigQuery back-ends.<p>We think even small, budding companies should have a data warehouse. A data warehouse can start as a unified home for your product analytics, marketing campaigns, vendor payments, sales tracking, etc. before actually needing massive analytical processing.<p>Here’s our official release blog: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hydras.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022-03-21-announcing-hydra-postgres-data-warehouse",
