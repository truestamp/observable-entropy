I&#x27;m the creator of <i>UnionML</i> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unionai-oss&#x2F;unionml, a Python MLOps framework that removes the boilerplate and friction associated with building and deploying machine learning systems to production.<p>I&#x27;ve been training and deploying models for almost a decade now, and one pain-point I&#x27;ve consistently had is managing the complexity of building and maintaining an ML stack that works for the entire model development lifecycle - from prototyping to production.<p>UnionML is built on top of Flyte (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flyte.org) and exposes a functional interface for defining the building blocks of your ML application via decorators -- think Flask or FastAPI method endpoints -- and UnionML takes care of bundling them into microservices for different use cases such as:<p>- model training<p>- batch prediction<p>- online prediction<p>- (more coming soon!)<p>This project aims to unify the rich ecosystem of data, ML, and MLOps tools that have emerged over the last decade or so (e.g. MLFlow, Sagemaker, Spark, etc.) to provide a nice UX for model developers, in both individual and team settings.<p>It&#x27;s very early days for this project, so if you&#x27;re interested in getting involved or learning more, you can go to the:<p>- Docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unionml.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;<p>- Repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;unionai-oss&#x2F;unionml<p>- Slack: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flyte-org.slack.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;C03JL38L65V",
