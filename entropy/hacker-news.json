      "text": "Show HN: Webbu - assistant for the browser<p>Hi HN! Fernando here. I want to show you the first version of Webbu (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webbu.app&#x2F;), an assistant, like Alexa, but for the browser. For example, you can change the color of a website by saying &quot;make the background blue&quot;. We have all been spending more time in the browser, and Webbu wants to be right there with you, helping you get things done quickly. There&#x27;s also a 1 min. demo video on the website.<p>This is just the first version and it doesn&#x27;t have many skills but I want to put it out there early so that folks can contribute to it. Anyone can create skills and the project itself is open source (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fersarr&#x2F;webbu_backend). If there is any revenue in the future, it will be shared with all the skill creators and open source contributors.<p>I will shortly create a tutorial on how to create skills. Basically, you can do it in a no-code fashion by using a combination of steps like &quot;type text&quot;, &quot;change style&quot;, &quot;open a URL&quot;, etc. Additionally, you will be able to create skills programmatically in the backend.<p>Thanks for reading! and feel free to drop any comments or ideas.",
