Lot of the research I found talk about brain imaging to find the parts of the brain currently activated (under some stressors), and propose solutions.<p>I&#x27;m curious about:\n1. the current state of brain imaging technology to accurately identify solutions to help a depressed person\n2. what are the blockers to allowing individuals to analyze their own brain state with at-home technologies?<p>Thank you.",
