      "text": "I am looking for recommendations for a local cloud hosting provider in Sweden which has AWS AZ like data center setup, provides managed kubernetes clusters, has 99.95+ SLA.\nManaged database and managed message queue solution would be very nice addition. 64vCPU&#x2F;128GB RAM (or higher specs) VM or host would be needed too.<p>Common searches return Bahnhof, Binero, Glesys, City Cloud, ElastX, Basefarm, Cygate. Do you have any experience with solutions from any of these companies? Would you recommend any one of them? Are there any hidden gems in Swedish market?<p>We don&#x27;t need all 100+ service what AWS provides. Managed kubernetes, managed MySQL&#x2F; MariaDB, managed Rabbit MQ&#x2F; Artemis would be good enough.",

It had a really nice design.<p>I recall it being on HN a while back.<p>Not sure if that&#x27;s enough to go on, but does anyone know what I&#x27;m talking about?",
