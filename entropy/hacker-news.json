      "text": "Love everyone&#x27;s opinion here on if the serverless functions (Like lambda functions from AWS, GCP cloud functions) have reached a position to create scalable apis to handle User apps with Millions of DAU?\nAlso if you can share your views along:\n1. Databases support available to Lambda (Due to connection exhaust issue.)\n2. Learning curve for new database technologies like dynamo db\n3. Some of these db technologies are vendor lock in. only available from AWS, like Dynamodb, Rds proxy\n4. Do you consider a cold start an issue big enough to not move into Serverless?\n5. Your choice between traditional microservices using docker and ECS&#x2F; Cloud Run or Kubernetes VS Lambda functions to create user facing apis?\n6. Cost comparision of both technologies on scale?",

I think having a pre-warmed network of friends by the time I land would be great, as opposed to pounding the pavement on day 1 or 2 with nobody to talk to.<p>I checked Meetup, and there seems to be a lot going on, although many events are still virtual - would a bummer if I was already there, but now I can actually join without being there yet.<p>Do you know any other online places I could go to make friends? Any Slack channels worth joining? Or, am I being silly?<p>To be clear I am simply looking for make friends, not to network for business purposes.<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "Two weeks ago, I announced that I was shutting down my companies, 70 Million Jobs and Commissary Club (companies that helped the formerly incarcerated get on with their lives). The overwhelming volume of support I received just through Bookface and Hacker News stunned me; my heart overflowed with pride and gratitude.<p>Now I am facing another challenge: I need a job. I’ve spoken with many recruiters and HR professionals, along with people who are interested in either acquiring my company(s), funding them or just want to make themselves available for a chat. I’ve received offers for leadership positions at nonprofits, but I haven’t yet discovered the right fit. Maybe I love the startup life too much. Maybe my criminal record hurts my chances. (Maybe!?!) Maybe my age is a deterrent.<p>Before I accept a position that doesn’t thrill me, I thought I’d get the word out to the YC community. Perhaps your company has—or has been considering—beginning a foundation or some other mission-based, social impact endeavor. Perhaps you need to hire lots of folks for your work force and want to seriously access the largely ignored 70 million Americans with records. I can help.<p>What else am I very good at? Business development, sales training and management.<p>Please note: I’m not very technical.<p>If you’ve got ideas, I’d love to hear them. Thanks for your time and consideration.",
