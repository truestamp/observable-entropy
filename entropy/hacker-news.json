      "text": "Hi guys.<p>A few months ago, I found a very interesting link on HackerNews which feature a cool drawing tool that can visualize the architect of &quot;normal&quot; web applications. I can vaguely remember these features:<p>- Can be drag-and-drop-ed\n- Written in React?\n- Interactive: put a frontend somewhere, a backend somewhere, and a database in anywhere else, and you can push a button to look at data&#x2F;dots that go from frontend to backend, and from backend to database<p>I have been looked around for nearly two hours at my bookmarks, my history, and even on HackerNews&#x27;s Algolia, but I could find nothing. Can someone please help me with the finding?<p>Thanks a lot!",
