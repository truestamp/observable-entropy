The cables that come with them are always crap (they fray just <i>looking</i> at them) and never last, but it seems like most third-party party brands aren&#x27;t really much better - they typically just stop working altogether after a while.<p>Are there any really good quality brands of cables for devices out there? What do you use?",

      "text": "In Latin America is not common to share salary information many times even between good  acquaintances . There are consulting services for companies that share specific salaries and benefits by role and with details on years of experience, that way companies can try to keep up with the market. But there is no such tool available for the public, at least in latam, to my knowledge.<p>I am thinking on building such a database but a few questions arised:<p>1. Do you believe glassdoor and similar services have brought more visibility on salary to the US?\n2. how to detect bogus input?\n3. is there a similar solution that is already available?",
