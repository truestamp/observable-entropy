      "text": "I have been using a 2012 Mac-mini with a copy of Adobe Creative suite CS6 which was fine* for what I wanted to accomplish. I mostly use Photoshop and a little bit of Illustrator; I intend to learn InDesign as well one day…\nThe problems I have are the latest version of OSX no longer works with CS6 and running OSX Mavericks is getting more and more dodgy as it is no longer being updated with security updates and I don’t want to shell out the huge spondoolies to Adobe (and I don’t want to be tied into a software-as-a-service deal anyway).<p>*+ I am peed off with Adobe&#x2F;Apple for never really sorting out a glitch in Photoshop CS6 see: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.adobe.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;photoshop-ecosystem-discussions&#x2F;help-photoshop-cs6-hangs-when-using-brush-clone-healing-brush-tools-etc-on-mac&#x2F;m-p&#x2F;4209121&#x2F;page&#x2F;16\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.adobe.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;photoshop-ecosystem-discussio...</a><p>I am thinking of going back to Windows. I have a legit copy of Photoshop CS5 that still runs under windows 10 fine and to be honest I think Microsoft for all their sins are better at enabling you to use your old software that you have actually paid for on there new OS’s than Apple. I would probably buy a new Mac-mini if I could still use CS6 on it, but alas I am too peed off with Adobe&#x2F;Apple right now.<p>I am thinking of shelling out on a New PC Rig instead and bighting the bullet and learning Affinity Photo and Design instead for the long term. I think this is goodbye OSX (pretty as you are) and Hello to Windows 10 dual booted with Manjaro -for giggles…<p>Does anyone have any other suggestions? I haven’t used GIMP for a while but last time I used it I didn’t get on with it (maybe I am a bit thick). I liked Krita a lot but it seemed a bit buggy- not complaining its free.<p>I am only designing like Youtube Thumbnails and the Odd poster doing a bit of WebDev HTML&#x2F;CSS and that sort of thing.. I don’t work in the design industry or anything.",
