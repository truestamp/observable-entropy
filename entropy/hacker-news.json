      "text": "Two thoughts after spending 2 years building a startup.<p>I think they apply to life in general. Let me know what you think.<p>1. Being more pragmatic.<p>Expect to sacrifice a lot of your idea for the customer. We first built this very exotic usecase for &quot;serverless&quot; tech we thought was really cool (you can find the old posts on my HN profile). But people kept using it to host plain web apps (much to our confusion). Eventually we built a product for that.<p>Imagine engineers at Apple or Samsung. They spend years on building groundbreaking batteries and chipsets. And then people use their phones mostly for TikTok. You have to be okay with that gap.<p>2. Doing what already has been done.<p>There&#x27;s this trend in startups to reinvent the wheel. In the beginning it&#x27;s very exciting (&quot;We&#x27;ll hire differently, and we&#x27;ll give stock differently...&quot;). But it gets tiring, and after a year you just want things to work.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re going fishing. You wouldn&#x27;t invent a new pole, a new camping chair, and a new way of catching fish. You would mostly use what is proven. Company-building is similar.<p>Jakob (building lightbottle.dev)",
