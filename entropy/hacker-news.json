      "text": "Ever tried to help a relative over the holidays to set up their home-banking? Lost in the juggling of your multi-factor device garden? Tried to get useful search results from Google recently to find yourself in advert hell? Longing for the old Amazon experience when today&#x27;s seems like running the gauntlet of grey-imports and scam-price offerings? Logged out of a site for 6 months and returning to a completely confusing new site where nothing is like it used to be? \nToday&#x27;s Internet experience has become user-hostile and it almost calls out for returning to the 90s: walled gardens aka Compuserve experience, dedicated devices for home-banking and standalone cameras.<p>What has led to this experience? On the top of my head I can see the following reasons:<p>* Release Often as KPIs for developers<p>The release often KPI for promotion and bonuses has led to constant changes to &#x27;systems that are working fine&#x27; to become ever-changing user experiences. While daily users can gradually phase-in changes, most sites that are casually used will confuse users with completely new error-prone experience.<p>* Payment Security and Financial Regulations<p>At least in the EU fraud has led to various tech-related regulation calling as an example for separate apps for IDs and for transaction verification. While it is well-meant, it leads people to check bank statements less often and anecdotally in my family confuses especially elderly users to the point of introducing more opportunity for scams and fraud.<p>* Patch-work nature of ID &amp; Verification<p>Captchas, Two-factor SMS, password rules and Authentication Apps have been patched onto the original user&#x2F;pass system. The experience has become truly annoying with some clear winners: anecdotally more and more people simply use Google&#x2F;Facebook OAuth as logins to sites. This is fine from a UI perspective, but lacks consumer regulation - what happens if you lose your access and who can you contact if your accounts get compromised&#x2F;scammed&#x2F;blocked?<p>* KPI switch from customer first to business model first<p>Having gained their audience share, Amazon and Google have switched from a &#x27;customer is king&#x27; perspective to one which suits their business model most.<p>What are other reasons?",
