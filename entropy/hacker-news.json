I feel Zapier has become a swiss-army knife product &quot;to do all things integration&quot; when most marketers just need it to integrate the form leads data.<p>Thank you.",

      "text": "Get ready to be bombarded with links :)<p>I&#x27;m a sixteen-year-old from Vermont. Yes, Vermont exists. I got a job programming, but the project died, and I was left looking for a new job which is pretty difficult without a GED or full-time working capability. Someone recommended I check out the Tweag open-source fellowship and come up with an application, so I started writing one. What I came up with was Fluidity, as described in the documents below. I don’t have a huge background in blockchain technology or writing interpreters, so I was hoping anybody sufficiently interested might be able to look over the technology and tell me what I’m overlooking or how foolish the idea is. I promise you it’s at least a little bit interesting.<p>Application: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;tweag&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4638654002#app<p>LinkedIn: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;bradly-ovitt-49185a22b&#x2F;\nOverview: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1O8yd5adg0WQAV7osLUQMzMD0uL-DzWMDBRwgzKSDOGU&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing\nQualifications: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1zWo8vgl-vF-2Eo_roj5ahYvNtb4dQS0M0S-A4uQMxCE&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing\nAnnexe: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1DMMIpaE1-PNlJpLoeTovJi5O8SqP0PzRfr7YARalAVw&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing",
