      "text": "Well, we all buy all kinds of things online nowadays, but a Home is probably the most expensive purchase most people will make.<p>I&#x27;d be more inclined to do this if it was a brand new home, which anyway you can&#x27;t visit and you make the decision based on the renders and reputation of the builder but I read that many people are also now purchasing existing (old) homes without even visiting them... especially in hot markets like Austin, where a lot of people out of state are making the transition and purchase a property as part of this.<p>Has anyone purchased a home online before seeing it? How was the experience?<p>Or if you are thinking of purchasing a home, have you given this option some thought?<p>What would be the most important things to verify&#x2F;check before making an online purchase of a home? I am guessing this is not something you can return just like at Walmart if you end up not being satisfied...or is there some kind of policy in this direction?",
