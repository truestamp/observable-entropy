While trying different things we eventually reached an impasse, with multiple of the following:<p>A: &quot;I&#x27;m pretty sure this won&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve tried it already. Here let me try it. See, it does&#x27;t work&quot;<p>B: &quot;Well, I was reading this article here and it said to try it this way. Maybe you&#x27;re missing something&quot;<p>-- Heated argument --<p>-- Apologies exchanged --<p>What are some methods&#x2F;strategies you&#x27;ve used to prevent the -- Heated argument -- phase before it happens?",

Like many others, I am appending &quot;reddit&quot; to almost every search to get useful results instead of low-quality spam.<p>Over the last few years I feel the same has been happening to Amazon. There have always been FBA sellers that buy from Chinese suppliers and re-brand the same base product, result in tons of different-looking-but-actually-same products. But it has never been as bad as now. It&#x27;s has become nearly impossible to find quality products in all the spam, sponsored ads, fake reviews, and rebrandings.<p>I am now finding myself appending &quot;reddit&quot; to my Amazon searches as well because I don&#x27;t trust the results! Does anyone else do the same?",

      "text": "The problem is that the Touch Bar is not in my normal view when I&#x27;m inputting text or using applications where it is useful. So I never built the habit pattern of looking at the Touch Bar where it is most useful. It provides a lot of use, I just never noticed it.<p>Now I look at it a lot more and realize it&#x27;s useful if the application developers built it correctly. Unfortunately, Apple doesn&#x27;t promote how to use their software very well. It&#x27;s just supposed to work. But when a new innovation changes the way you look at your computer, where your eyes move to, you have to deliberately tell a seasoned user to look there, to change their workflow. I never looked at the Touch Bar and I hated not having function keys. But now that I do use it a lot, I&#x27;m going to miss it I think, especially the volume and brightness controls. Long story short, Apple failed to properly change user&#x27;s habit patterns by just hoping the change would work naturally, it doesn&#x27;t.<p>All that said, I know the Touch Bar is a contentious subject, and people are going to post how much they hate it. But I really hope they think about how much they actually look at it for most applications. I will state that for VSCode I&#x27;d rather have function keys.",
