      "text": "Hi guys,<p>I have been suffering from CSCR, (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Central_serous_chorioretinopathy) for a few weeks now.\nThis is a disease that affects the vision in one eye. I am pretty sure it is related to stress at work.<p>Honestly I was very surprised because I always felt like I could take stress quite well. For now I try to reduce stress as much as possible but I&#x27;m scared to fall back in the future (I&#x27;m 27).<p>Has anyone similar issues? How did you handle it? Any ideas how to find the &quot;right&quot; balance of stress?",
