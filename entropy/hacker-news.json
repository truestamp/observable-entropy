      "text": "I work at one of the big tech companies. I make what I think is good money, and I generally enjoy my work (although it has been starting to feel like a bit of a grind). I&#x27;ve been here for over two years.<p>I got an offer from a startup that is doing well financially. The salary is good and the equity seems like it could be okay after some negotiation. I&#x27;m not sure precisely what I&#x27;d be working on but I do know the general area. The people seem intelligent and fun.<p>I&#x27;m trying to decide if I should make the jump. I really like having an office to go into, the benefits, and the pay of where I&#x27;m at. But trying something new seems like a really interesting change, even if I&#x27;m giving up quite a bit in my book.<p>Has anyone else made a similar change (or decided against it)? How did you come to your conclusion?",
