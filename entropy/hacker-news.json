      "text": "Battery usage&#x2F;autonomy is\n- a key component in UX, and\n- major driver of mobile device obsolescence (batteries get worn down faster, hence buying a new device sooner).<p>As a developer, I would like to easily assess my app and&#x2F;or web site impact on battery usage. Ideally, I would like to integrate it in my CI&#x2F;CD pipeline to drive continuous improvement.<p>What are my options ?<p>Here are a few related things I found:\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;S2-group&#x2F;android-runner\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.websitecarbon.com&#x2F;\n- http:&#x2F;&#x2F;luiscruz.github.io&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;20&#x2F;measuring-energy.html\n- http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecometer.org&#x2F;\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cnumr&#x2F;GreenIT-Analysis&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;README.md",

      "text": "My 12 year old daughter has covid-19 with a fever of 40.1 celsius (before putting down the fever with medicine), the doctor says she doesn&#x27;t need to be looked at closer since statistically very few children of her age die or suffer permanent problems from the infection.<p>I&#x27;m thinking this sounds like a categorical error, in that it should be very few children of her age suffer any negative effects whatsoever, but once you have 40 degrees fever, lose sense of smell and taste and so forth, it should be taken as seriously as if someone of my age was suffering the same.<p>But I can&#x27;t really prove this idea, so does anyone have resources whereby I can figure out if it is as I think, or if the doctor&#x27;s statement about the statistics are correct?",
