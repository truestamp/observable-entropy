      "text": "1.  Feelings matter, but facts and reality matter more.<p>Take education, for example.  The students&#x27; self image matters, even for education purposes.  Students who think they can do it learn more than students who think they can&#x27;t.  But actually learning matters <i>more</i> than self-image does.  There&#x27;s a real world outside of school that we&#x27;re trying to raise children to be able to live in, and the real world will destroy their self-esteem if they can&#x27;t actually do what the real world needs them to do.<p>Or take politics.  How the voters feel about your policies matters.  You can&#x27;t get them to follow policies that they feel are wrong.  But in the end, it matters more whether the policies <i>work</i> than it does how the public feels.<p>2.  In the long run, you won&#x27;t win zero-sum games enough to make them worth playing.<p>Again, this applies to politics.  In fact, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong with Congress.  They&#x27;re so busy playing zero-sum games that they can&#x27;t govern.<p>It also applies to the culture wars.  Both sides are so busy trying to gain another foot of ground that they miss that they&#x27;re destroying the culture.<p>Maybe two points isn&#x27;t enough for a manifesto.  What else should be in here?",
