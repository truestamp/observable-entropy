I use bootstrap which helps a lot.<p>I think the problem is mostly with the layout of elements on the page. I try not to overdo things with unnecessary elements, and I&#x27;ve gotten to a point where each individual piece of the webpage (e.g. a button, a logo, a navbar, a form) looks fine <i>on its own</i>, but as a whole it doesn&#x27;t look professional (for reasons I&#x27;m not yet perceptive enough to detect - I can tell it&#x27;s clunky but I can&#x27;t articulate <i>why</i> it doesn&#x27;t look great).<p>I know 30 minutes is ambitious, but I&#x27;m working on an MVP and don&#x27;t have a lot of time <i>right now</i> (in the future, absolutely).<p>Any recommendations for crash courses, videos, articles, or tutorials greatly appreciated!
