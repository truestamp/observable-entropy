      "text": "Hi all! I&#x27;m a data scientist (specialized in retail analytics) and I quite enjoy my job. However, recently, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of free time, and I&#x27;m looking for a fun (but challenging) long-term side project which is not 100% in my domain. I do not care about making money, and I would prefer it to have a &quot;physical&quot; dimension to them.<p>Some examples I&#x27;m thinking of: Building a face tracking drone, Using OpenBCI sensors, Adding functionalities to XGO Mini &quot;robot dog&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear more ideas from you, especially if someone has some practical problems they think are worth solving. If anyone is already working on something like this, I&#x27;d love to join you.",
