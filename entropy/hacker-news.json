      "text": "I have a name that&#x27;s apparently common in Europe. Every couple of weeks I get an email asking me to verify&#x2F;confirm my email address.<p>They never ever seem to have a button that says &quot;DENY VERIFICATION &quot; or &quot;Nope, that&#x27;s not me&quot;<p>Small shops I never heard of and big, international, well known businesses - they never have a &quot;Do not approve &#x2F; register &#x2F; verify&quot; button.<p>(Today I just got half a dozen emails from PayPal - apparently somebody is using my email address to register. Based on subsequent emails, even though this email was <i>never verified</i>,  they continue to do their business and register. PayPal won&#x27;t let me deny usage of my email, submit a ticket, or contact support for help without logging in, which obviously I cannot and do not want to do - I&#x27;m not to the one who got registered!).<p>So what is the <i>point</i> in email verification emails, if there&#x27;s no way to deny it &#x2F; indicate &quot;Nope that&#x27;s not me, don&#x27;t do it&quot;?",
