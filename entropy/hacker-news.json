      "text": "Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve been googling for the last 5 hours, trying to open an account for my girlfriend on a digital bank like Zen but my account have been rejected (I am from South America), we tried Revolut but it didn&#x27;t work, etc.<p>Basically I have a debit card and my girlfriend wants to travel with her sister. I can&#x27;t give her my credit card because the names are not going to match, so I&#x27;d LOVE to know if there is a service that would allow us to create a virtual card under her name that uses my card in the background (or any simlar solution - opening an account and me tranfering money to her would work).<p>We tried this last suggestion with Payoneer, Zen.com and Revolut without luck (Payoneer declined her account and Zen too, Revolut doesnt seem to work in our country).<p>Thanks!",
