      "text": "Hello all,<p>I have been working on a self hosted CalDAV calendar client Bloben https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nibdo&#x2F;bloben-app<p>This is mostly an alternative to other web clients like great AgenDAV with some additional features I wanted to use like email invites, alarms, webcalendars, etc.<p>You can play with demo (limited to read access) here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.bloben.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;v1&#x2F;users&#x2F;login-demo?username=demo&amp;password=Bg8v16a4q7gvC&amp;redirect=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.bloben.com&#x2F;calendar?demo=true<p>In the end it should provide separate clients also for CalDAV tasks and notes.<p>One thing I would maybe like to discuss more is adding encryption, which is obviously quite problematic when using standards like CalDAV. Initially I just added non-compatible fully encrypted calendars, but realised this might not be useful for many people using different clients.<p>Something halfway is adding an option to protect only some, say sensitive, events by encrypting fields like title, description or location. That way events will still be displayed via standard mobile apps and decrypted only in Bloben client (with link to open from description).<p>As part of this project I published also React calendar component https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nibdo&#x2F;kalend<p>Thank you, if you are interested and feel free to ask me anything.",
