      "text": "Hi guys. I&#x27;ve been to the WeAreDevelopers 2022 World Congress (day 1 out of 2) and just got back to the hotel.<p>Let me recap:<p>- there were approximately 8.000 people\n- ticket is 500 EUR approx. (+ travel cost for most)\n- 9.15 was opening but i waited in line till 10.45\n- technical difficulties: i received a QR code for checkin but that expired and i had to install the congress app otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t let me in (i was told)\n- ironically all of their congress apps and API crashed over and over again, it was bugged out, the feed repeated itself and so forth\n- it was WAY TOO CROWDED, some workshops were for 20-40 people but again, when there are 8.000 people around, you can imagine\n- there were 10 food trucks (and they accept cash only) for 8000 people\n- &quot;WE ARE HIRING&quot; basically every company there\n-<p>Some of my other personal impressions:\n- i attended the &quot;scaling with typescript&quot; talk and: damn it was bad. the code wasn&#x27;t clean at all and the speaker included some mistakes also; presentation was way too dark with dark text, basically unreadable on a projector. powerpoint 2005 skills be like\n- all the &quot;partners&quot; and companies there weren&#x27;t really about tech but &quot;we are hiring&quot;\n- most of the other talks were about marketing, that&#x27;s it\n- there was maybe 1&#x2F;3 code in the talks i attended and i choose wisely<p>What do you think? Have you been to the WeAreDevelopers World Congress this year? It was my first time and probably the last.",
