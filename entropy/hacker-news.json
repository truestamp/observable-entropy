      "text": "The last time I did web development from scratch for a frontend-heavy app (think unbundling Excel), the way of doing it was with a frontend in React&#x2F;Angular&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;etc, and a backend REST API in anything. It seems like things have changed a lot, and I&#x27;m wondering how I could learn about that and evaluate the different approaches. Nowadays I hear people talking about their frontend framework (React, lots of Next, things like that) and that&#x27;s bascially it. A few questions:<p>- How do you handle authn&#x2F;authz? Do you use auth providers? Who are they, and what are the tradeoffs? Do you deploy yourself an auth API? Which one do people use?<p>- How do you handle persistance? With database providers, like Firebase&#x2F;FaunaDB? How&#x27;s testing?<p>- Do people just don&#x27;t write backend anymore? I hear a lot about lambda functions, which seems great for one-off jobs (send an email, process an order), but I don&#x27;t imagine that people write all of their backend with it. Are backend not a thing anymore?<p>- If that&#x27;s the case, what are the tradeoffs compared to the &quot;old&quot; way of doing it, and the even older (server-side rendered HTML with lots of JS)? Do you gain development speed? Maybe you write more code specific to your &quot;problem&quot; and less plumbing that everyone needs? Would you consider this the best approach to develop a frontend-heavy app in 2022?<p>- How do you learn about all that? Read news often? Are there people making comprehensive reports&#x2F;tech radars of what&#x27;s used and how well it works? Are there good books on the subject? Blogs? Podcasts, videos?",
