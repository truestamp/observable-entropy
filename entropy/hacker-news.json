      "text": "I&#x27;ve been asked about suggestions for handling the versioning of documents for a group of people who are not engineers &#x2F; necessarily tech savy.  The major use case is the sharing (and editting) of documents using a tool that does not have collaborative features.  It also produces a file format that isn&#x27;t one that two edits can be merged easily.<p>The &quot;sharing&quot; will basically be edit, commit, next person edit.  Versioning is important in addition to sharing an existing file.<p>The current work is done using a shared drive (like google or onedrive) and risks edits writing on top of one another.  Additionally lacking any sort of history.<p>Github &#x2F; etc would likely be a bit of a learning curve.  Are there other suggestions?",
