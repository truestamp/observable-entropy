The list of things I have failed at my entire life is monstrous.<p>I have failed my way to amazing engineering jobs and then failed out. Either by way of being managed out or by leaving before things got too bad.<p>There was a time when I was fine with this. But now, with a family, I am having some real regrets. I have trained myself to be OK with procrastination in the moment. Always ready to be angry at myself afterword.<p>I am now so self-critical that I get caught in worry loops that keep me doing nothing productive.<p>I started seeing a therapist but it’s just embarrassing to fully say how I feel things are going and how deep this dysfunction actually goes. At this point my therapist is like a paid buddy who hears me vent. He offers many solutions I try but never stick to.<p>I need to break this cycle and I need ideas.",

      "text": "&quot;Musical dyslexia&quot; isn&#x27;t quite the right term (what is a better term?) I have trouble anticipating&#x2F;&quot;feeling&quot; music when (swing) dancing. So I have trouble recognizing&#x2F;recalling musical patterns; not necessarily reading musical notation.<p>Dyslexics can learn how to read, but they need to be taught differently. Is there some type of musical training for people like me? I managed to learn how to feel&#x2F;anticipate 8-count beats, but can&#x27;t get beyond 8-counts (while dancing). I even tried building a beat-aware video player[1] to help me learn musicality.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the argument musicality is acquired, not learned. I think acquisition would be better, but does not rule out learning. For example, I never heard about &quot;uncountable nouns&quot; while learning English as a native speaker; only in the context of ESL. This is English grammar native speakers acquire, but ESL students tend to learn. But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any &quot;ESL&quot; for music.<p>I can read sheet music and understand musical patterns at an intellectual level. However, despite taking piano lessons for more than two years, I didn&#x27;t understand some fundamental musical concepts (like the emphasis on the &quot;1&quot; beat) until over a decade later when learning how to dance.<p>During that whole time, I was listening to music all the time. Although vaguely aware of what a 3-count waltz beat was, my mind was blown when I learned you could waltz to a Bryan Adams song I had heard over and over before. So I think I have some type of music learning disability.<p>Often when music breaks dancers will stop with the music. I couldn&#x27;t figure how other dancers knew when to do this. Did they memorize the songs? Even armed with the knowledge that (big band&#x2F;pop) music often follows a very regular repeating 32-count pattern, it&#x27;s very hard for me to predict exactly when the music will break (especially while dancing at the same time).<p>Apparently another way to feel the music is by the relative intensity of major beats. The first beat in a bar is usually the strongest; the last beat the weakest. Likewise, in a set of 2, 4, 8 bars the first beat will be strongest and the last beat the weakest. I explained this in more detail here[2]. In addition, there&#x27;s often a &quot;ramp-up&quot; or &quot;ramp-down&quot; in the final bars of an 8-bar set leading to the big &quot;1&quot; beat of the next 8-bar set. So there is a spectrum of relative intensities correlated to position in the music.<p>Unfortunately, I either lack the ability to recall more than the most recent 8 beats and&#x2F;or sense the fine differences in the relative intensity of the beats. My mind seems to be better at processing visual information slowly and recalling summaries; not processing audio information in real-time and verbatim recall.<p>I would be happy just to be able to feel the basic 32-count beat patterns. But I know there are even more layers to musicality. Like picking out the melody or a specific instrument. Apparently songs have structure and &quot;tell&quot; a story (outside the lyrics) which just goes completely over my head.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phrasier.leftium.com&#x2F;\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cafe.naver.com&#x2F;hotcoolswing&#x2F;7922",
