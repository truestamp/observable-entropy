      "text": "Hey HN-community,<p>I am shocked by the current state of newsletter tools. Currently I am using Mailchimp for a ~350 subscriber newsletter and I hate it. It&#x27;s so bloated with tons of stuff no one needs and the visual editor is the worst.\nSubstack is even worse, since you cannot even disable tracking.<p>What I am looking for:<p>- simple, bare bones list management (self-service subscribe, unsubscribe etc)\n- no tracking or stats whatsoever\n- Markdown editor or plain text also fine<p>Any ideas? What are you using? I am SO CLOSE for building my own thing with AWS SES and a spreadsheet or similar ;)<p>Cheers and happy holidays,\nben",
