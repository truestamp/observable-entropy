      "text": "Hey all! I&#x27;m starting my first swe job out of grad school soon. From a few internship experiences, I found myself going all out on the project at hand while not doing anything else.<p>Now that I have a permanent job, I want to keep my job time restricted to 9-5 and outside of it, I&#x27;m interested in learning about multiple topics unrelated to the job like Natural Language Processing, Topics in Economics&#x2F;Finance&#x2F;Management, Information Retrieval, etc.<p>How do you all go about choosing what to read&#x2F;learn when you have many options to consider? Do you employ any framework for doing this? How have you been able to keep your job time separate from personal development time? Thanks!",
