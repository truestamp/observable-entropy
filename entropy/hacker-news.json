We were frustrated with text diffs on GitHub PRs, so we made DiffLens (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;difflens\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;marketplace&#x2F;difflens</a>). DiffLens constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree for each file, and uses that semantic information to intelligently diff changes. Checkout the demo on our website (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.difflens.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.difflens.com</a>).<p>Getting started with DiffLens is easy! Simply install the app on your repositories. The next time you open a PR, DiffLens will automatically create a diff for your changes. If you review code, especially TypeScript, JavaScript or CSS, give DiffLens a try!<p>We&#x27;re always looking for feedback. If you encounter bugs, or want to give us feedback, we&#x27;ll be around. You can also reach us at support@difflens.com.",
