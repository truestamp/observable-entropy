      "text": "Hi,<p>We are 3 people (2 developers + 1 trader) who are making trading tools intended to trade our own capital.<p>So far we have a desktop application which is a UI for the trader to interact with. And a modular monolith for the backend with MongoDb as a database. We also have a number of jobs that need to be run on the regular (mostly to keep required data up to date in mongo). All the source is in C#.<p>We only have a local environment. We want to expand to have a development and a production environment. What is the best way to do this?<p>We have some CI, but how do we do CD? Where should we run the backend? How do we deploy the UI to the traders desktop?<p>We want to keep the costs low and we got burned by an unexpected bill when trying to run this on Azure (which Microsoft luckily waived). We considered having a script which the trader runs which will essentially do a git pull and then run the build and run scripts. But that way we lose control over the backend.<p>Any suggestions welcome,<p>Thanks",
