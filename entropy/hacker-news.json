It is about a fictional world where, at some point, somebody invents &quot;color&quot; to paint their transparent houses and the government is passing policy to add surveillance. It shows how empty certain arguments from politicians are to pass laws to reduce privacy.<p>Can anybody help? (I will bookmark the story directly)",
