      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on building &quot;the fastest news website&quot; for a few reasons:<p>1. I got tired of waiting for news websites to load, so I made a text-only news website that only has major news headlines.<p>2. I wanted to demonstrate to the world that if you want to build something really fast on the web, you can do it without loads of JavaScript.<p>3. I wanted to show that you can design something that looks good without having tons of images, etc.<p>I put together the speed page at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legiblenews.com&#x2F;speed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legiblenews.com&#x2F;speed</a> to hold my website to be more accountable for speed, but it&#x27;s also interesting to see how fast other news websites are (or in most cases, are not).<p>Some feedback I&#x27;m interested in receiving:<p>1. What&#x27;s your take both on the speed ranking methodology for Legible News?<p>2. Are my descriptions of the metrics for a non-web developer reasonable? Example of that at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legiblenews.com&#x2F;speed&#x2F;websites&#x2F;associated-press\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legiblenews.com&#x2F;speed&#x2F;websites&#x2F;associated-press</a>, and if you click through the links on that table, you see a description like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legiblenews.com&#x2F;speed&#x2F;audits&#x2F;cumulative-layout-shift\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legiblenews.com&#x2F;speed&#x2F;audits&#x2F;cumulative-layout-shift</a><p>Sorry ahead of time, but I can&#x27;t fit all news websites on the speed report. I had to target general news websites, not ones for specific niches like HN for Tech. If there&#x27;s something you think that&#x27;s missing please post it, but I can&#x27;t promise that I&#x27;ll add it.<p>If you like it, please consider subscribing! Thanks!",

      "text": "A hybrid office is meant to serve multiple personas. Does anyone here work in one? What’s the dream setup?<p>A little cynical view follows. Many companies embrace hybrid and gather a lot of feedback. Yet there seems to be little new to serve engineering teams better. More crammed (beautifully designed) open floor plans and, if we are lucky, a bit less overbooked ”phone booths” and collaboration spaces. Of all the people, those that prefer or need to work at the office seem least well served.<p>There is an opportunity to reinvent the office concept for the better. Has anyone done it in a way truly inclusive of all preferences and functions?",
