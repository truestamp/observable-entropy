      "text": "Long time lurker, always pull inspiration from show HN.<p>For the longest time, i thought my career path was to be senior developer, an architect, maybe one day a CTO.\nOnce i got into some of these positions i had major imposture syndrome, especially because i never finished college and only worked with select web languages (PHP, JS, Python). Yet i could lead a team, do the work, and for the most part was extremely passionate about it.<p>After years of successes and failures i became burnt out putting in 12+ hour days, constant feelings of imposture syndrome, not knowing how to get to the next level (lack of mentorship or a good manager), and not knowing how to handle the failures; i switched careers. \nThought maybe going into management would feel better, so an easy transition was becoming a (technical) project manager. At first it felt easy, some of the responsibilities were the same as what i had been doing before! However, lately i’ve realized that both the place i am working and this shift wasn’t necessarily right for me, that i hadn’t been growing, learning how to be a better PM or even working on that many projects due to the slow pace of the company.<p>With that, i’ve tried to spend time figuring out what could be a natural career progression based off my experience - and honestly i’m so unsure of which way to go or how to build a solid career path.\nI keep thinking either going back to development (but i’m a few years rusty now and don’t know how well i’ll be accepted even if i spend a few months sharpening those skills) or trying out product management (which excites me, and feels very challenging).<p>Are there other paths I should consider?\nAre any of the mentorship &#x2F; career coaching services good?\nI’ve seen things like Pathrise, BetterUp, Mento - but really unsure if they actually would help.<p>i’m hoping someone on here can help me out or point me to some good resources.",
