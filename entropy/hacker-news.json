      "text": "I’m looking to make a new personal website and it seems there’s all sorts of opinions and different ways to do it.<p>Generally I want a lot of customizability but also the ability to add Pages here and there plus maybe a blog section&#x2F;hobbies (video). I know that people will be extremely opinionated, but was just curious what people thought on rolling your own full website versus using some CRM to manage content.<p>Any suggestions or advice welcome? \nOr even opinions on tech stack?<p>Fwiw I was thinking React, with some bucket based serving for heavier objects, and maybe some scripted CRM that I’d make",
