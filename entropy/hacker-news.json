      "text": "Hello HN!  We&#x27;re Sam and Kanyes. We&#x27;re building an extension to help you remember what you read online.   We&#x27;re calling it Ferret [1].<p>When you open Ferret on an HTML page, it generates recall-based questions + answers to reinforce key concepts with NLP.  Consider the following toy example where we open Ferret on an explanation of Bayesian statistics. [2]<p>Q:  What does the frequentist interpretation view probability as?\nA:  the limit of the relative frequency of an event after many trials<p>Q: What is often computed in Bayesian statistics using mathematical optimization methods?\nA:The maximum a posteriori<p>We do this by (1)  Parsing the DOM tree of an HTML page for &lt;p&gt; tags on the client, and segmenting these into preprocessed chunks (2) Performing inference on question-generation with a T5-base model pretrained on SQuAD (3) Extractive question-answering with the chunk &amp; question we&#x27;ve generated with RoBERTa, also pretrained on SQuAD.<p>No GPT-3 hereâ€” where&#x27;s the fun in an API call when you can do it yourself.  Ferret is built as a React.JS app deployed as a chrome extension, with models hosted on AWS Sagemaker.<p>Finally, why could this be helpful?\nHuman memory is lossy. Psychologists have shown for forever that your memory can be modeled with a forgetting curve.  If you don&#x27;t attempt to retain knowledge, you&#x27;ll likely lose it.  But most of the content we read online (technical blog posts, documentation, course notes, articles) gets ingested and quickly forgotten.  We&#x27;re interested in low-friction approaches to helping people better remember this content , starting with fellow engineers who depend on their ability to remember key concepts to do the best job.<p>We&#x27;ve open-sourced the full repo and are actively responding to PRs + issues. [3].  You can read more about the technical + product challenges we faced if that interests you as well. [4]<p>We appreciate all feedback and suggestions!<p>[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;ferret&#x2F;mjnmolplinickaigofdpejfgfoehnlbh\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bayesian_statistics<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kanyesthaker&#x2F;qgqa-flashcards<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samgorman.notion.site&#x2F;Ferret-c7508ec65df841859d1f84e518fcf21d",
