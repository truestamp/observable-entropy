      "text": "We use CircleCI at our company, but I&#x27;ve been pretty frustrated with their uptime, issues with jobs being triggered, VMs not being allocated, etc. We have a compact test suite that runs on every branch with an open github PR, and it&#x27;s really disruptive to the organization&#x27;s productivity when there&#x27;s a CircleCI outage. It effectively blocks our developers from making progress (or at least merging code).<p>I realize CI is a complicated thing to build, but I&#x27;m wondering: are there better alternatives out there that we should try? What have your experiences been with CircleCI or other tools?",
