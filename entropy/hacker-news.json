      "text": "Hello,<p>I would like to ask for your feedback on a website I&#x27;ve been working on. I recently developed a Spotify playlist sharing forum ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharelist.org).<p>The site functions as a social board where users can share and review playlists. The long-term goal is to create an active community for individuals to find new music they enjoy. The website is currently in beta, and I hope to launch soon. Please let me know your honest opinion and any thoughts on room for improvement!<p>Site to test: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharelist.org<p>(Note: So sorry for the repost! This was my first time using Hacker News and I meant for the post to go in the Ask HN section, I didn&#x27;t realize adding a URL would put the post in another section. My apologies!)<p>Thank you so much.",
