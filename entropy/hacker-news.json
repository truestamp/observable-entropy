And the more important mails I have to open during the day, the more I&#x27;m drained of my mental capacity to handle this stress.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is a crazy idea, but I thought about using sentiment analysis AI to read my mails before me, and tell me how positive or negative each message is without opening them first, so I can choose when I want to read bad news. Or sort my mails by priority.<p>Do you think that might be useful? or do you have better low tech solutions to that problem?(besides CBT, weed or xanax)",
