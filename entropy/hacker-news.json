      "text": "Hey everyone!<p>Like many data analysts and engineers, I love SQL and the dbt ecosystem. So it bothers me that we have to use separate tools for product analytics. We do our transformations, BI work, and ad-hoc queries in SQL, but when it&#x27;s time to look at funnels and flows, we have to use (and procure) a separate platform like Mixpanel or Amplitude.<p>This dbt package is a (very rough) start at fixing that. With it, you can create event streams and run funnel analyses via dbt[0]. More features like flows and retention are coming soon!<p>But I&#x27;m mostly curious how you all are doing product analytics right now. Are you using a dedicated tool like Amplitude? What could be better? Do you want to do product analytics in SQL in the warehouse or would you rather it live somewhere else?<p>Would love to get your thoughts, and thanks for taking a look!<p>---<p>0. (and soon, with dbt Server, in your favorite BI tool or SQL client): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MdSMSbQxnO0&amp;ab_channel=dbt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MdSMSbQxnO0&amp;ab_channel=dbt</a>",
