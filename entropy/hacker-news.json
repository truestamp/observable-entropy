      "text": "Many tech companies (Google, Facebook, Apple, Uber, etc) have set early September as the time in which employees will be required to return to the office. In a world before the delta variant it seemed plausible that vaccination alone could allow everyone to return to office. But looking at the data coming out of Israel, UK, and the EU, as well as variant data in the US, we can assume that COVID-19 cases are going to significantly increase in the US in the upcoming weeks, followed by increased hospitalizations (albeit at a lower rate than pre-vaccination). Tech companies could still decide to force employees back into the office but outside of Apple I find it hard to believe that they&#x27;ll force everyone to come back in the midst of an outbreak, which now seems inevitable.",
