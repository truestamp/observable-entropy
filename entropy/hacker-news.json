      "text": "Our bootstrapped SaaS is growing at 3-5%&#x2F;month and recently reached 7 figures. Was launched 4 years ago specialized on an under-served niche that for most it was too small.<p>Since then that segment grew and lots of competitors appeared on the market, some grew a bit faster than us because they had better marketing (we did no marketing) and a bit better UI&#x2F;UX, even though we were the first.<p>In the last year, 2 of the new competitors that are close to our size got acquired and even if we had no plan to sell it, I&#x27;m wondering if we shouldn&#x27;t do the same mostly because of the extra help in hiring, managing the business, etc.<p>we&#x27;re only 3 people, the business is very profitable but hiring is very challenging. As far as I know, those acquired businesses got access to an already built team of designers, developers, marketers and sales people..... something that will be hard for us to do. I&#x27;m afraid that our competitors will eat us alive with those resources at their disposal and when we are prepared to sell the business, we&#x27;ll be too far away from them.<p>Any ideas on how to handle this? Is there a way to do a partial exit and get access to an already built team?",
