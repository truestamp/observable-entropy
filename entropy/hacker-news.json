I&#x27;d like to work in NYC on-site, but don&#x27;t really have enough cash to pay deposit before starting to earn a paycheck.  Do you have any tips on getting a package that includes relocation expenses (or an apartment)? Is it possible in general?  I am a technical manager who worked as a startup founder and am returning to full-time work for family reasons.",
