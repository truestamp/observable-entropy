      "text": "I&#x27;m working as a data engineer and I realized I lack some skills when interviewing for a new job: design patterns, good practices, object oriented design, query optimizations...<p>On my job I&#x27;m very deep into SQL queries, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to learn those kind of skills on the job. So I&#x27;m feeling stuck.<p>I&#x27;d like to make some courses and read some books in order to brush up on that kind of skills but between my full time job and my one year child I&#x27;ve almost no free time to spend learning.<p>So I&#x27;m looking to optimize my learning path, finding myself on a paralysis of choice: I don&#x27;t know if the best would be to start reading books, getting through a series of online courses or practice by reading OS code. It&#x27;d be great to learn those skills on an incremental way, a bit of every skill for each iteration.<p>What would you recommend?",
