At first: I thought it was a lazy person&#x27;s dream, but more and more I realize a lot of the low hanging fruit that you can do with code has been done and there&#x27;s little left to make. I mean, why bother re-invent the wheel right? So now I just leverage software made by <i>other people</i> typically GUIs &#x2F; point-and-click tools and a bunch of online services to automate burdensome tasks.<p>I still write simple one-liner helper scripts in my free time though, typically userscripts that I place into Tampermonkey&#x2F;Violentmonkey to automate a bunch of stuff and make the web more accessible. I call this &#x27;low code&#x27; so I&#x27;m not entirely reliant on GUIs.<p>What&#x27;s your thought on the movement? Do you like the term &#x27;nocode&#x27;?",
