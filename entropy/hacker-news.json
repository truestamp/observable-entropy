      "text": "The idea of bi-directional links started to get popular beginning in 2019. Products such as RoamResearch, Obsidian, Logseq, and Notion applied this feature to link internal pages. I was thinking: wouldn&#x27;t it be great if bi-directional links could be used across apps (say: Slack and Notion). Instead of switching apps (causing loss of focus), people can navigate through apps with links in the order of their workflow. I am putting my effort into implementing this feature on my upcoming product; what do you all think?",
