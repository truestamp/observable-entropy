      "text": "I am not a climate scientist by any stretch. However given that all life on the planet is a direct result of the Sun and the energy we receive from it, it would make sense if that less of the sun&#x27;s energy was used to grow things (which must use up a lot of energy as chemical bonds are being formed) then there must be more energy used to just make atoms vibrate. So if we grew more things AND &#x2F; OR used really inefficient Solar panels OR used the sun&#x27;s energy to melt vast quantities of eutectic salts then we could reduce the rate of temperature change on the planet by putting more of the sun&#x27;s energy to state change &#x2F; energy capture. Just a thought.",
