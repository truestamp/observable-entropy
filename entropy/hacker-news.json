      "text": "Hello and Happy New Year HN! Hope all the bests in 2022. So I&#x27;ve been working on a minimal calendar app , named Clendar (Calendar without an &#x27;a&#x27;). I know, it&#x27;s not a good SEO name, but I will go with it :)<p>I&#x27;ve been building Clendar on my spare time. At first, it&#x27;s just a side weekend project so that I can learn new Apple technologies, but, the app came to the point of usability that I think I should publish on the App Store anyway for the world to know and use it. Besides, I have been trying to design the app for minimal and usability in mind. Also, the app is fully open-source, as a way for me to give back to the app developers community.<p>+ App Store: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;clendar-a-calendar-app&#x2F;id1548102041<p>+ Landing page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clendar.info<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions, thanks!",

      "text": "(I&#x27;ve clearly spent too much time with Feynman and quantum but...)<p>Quantum computing is statistical in nature. Experiments need to be performed multiple times to get reliable results.<p>Which got me to thinking... Quantum effects occur everywhere at room temperature. One example is the thermal noise in a resistor.<p>It ought to be possible to impose forces, such a magnetic fields, on the resistor to &quot;shape&quot; the thermal noise in various ways. Using this shaping effects it ought to be possible to impose some logic &quot;on the noise&quot;. From there, it seems reasonable that statistical measurements could yield &quot;computed results&quot;.<p>The useful point is that it ends up using quantum effects at room temperature, albeit somewhat slower than in a supercooled quantum computer. It seems reasonable that there must be a &quot;speed vs temperature&quot; curve for this &quot;in the noise&quot; computing.<p>One interesting experiment would be to create a Toffoli gate in a resistor using N vs S magnetic fields as the control elements. Since this would be symmetric it would also be reversible.<p>The end result is a &quot;room temperature&quot; quantum computer.",
