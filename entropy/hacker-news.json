      "text": "Reading a previous thread it got me wondering about defense startups and how they bridge the gap between garage office and desert testing ground.<p>For those maybe already in this field, I&#x27;d like to hear your experiences. Here are some questions that come to mind:<p>- What distinguishes a defense startup apart from just some nerds &quot;blowing things up in the desert&quot;?<p>- Aside from accidents in testing, what are the common pitfalls of this field of study?<p>- Are there stories that come to mind about notable contractors that encountered problems? Notable successes?<p>- What legal risks are there in the development and procurement process? I&#x27;d assume just by virtue of searching certain topics or even acquiring parts you&#x27;d be having some very serious conversations with officials. Do these startups have a formal way to announce their intentions ahead of time before trouble erupts?<p>- What is the general consensus of this field when it is not war time? Is it generally feast or famine, or is the demand for defense tech relatively constant?<p>- Are these startups typically VC funded on the open market, or does your government typically fund ideas it needs&#x2F;wants?<p>- What are the limitations of the concepts that may be researched? Surely you can&#x27;t just come up with an idea for a particle disintegrator and start vaporizing cacti in the wild. Are defense contractors generally limited to missiles and things of that sort?<p>- What are the dominant traits that contractors generally have that make them a good fit for this field?",
