      "text": "I&#x27;m setting up a Teltonika device for OOB access for a remote location. I wanted to go with Opengear but they don&#x27;t have anything in stock for 14-16 weeks!<p>Anyways, Teltonika is a pretty nice product and their RMS central hub makes using the product even easier by allowing you to connect to their device at all times.<p>But there&#x27;s one huge caveat for me. They allow the downloading of openvpn configs even after you create them and those configs contain all the keys in the clear, no passphrase required.<p>If someone were to hack their RMS app, they could essentially connect directly to all the internal networks of their customers by downloading these openvpn configs.<p>Am I right in being paranoid about this ? I suggested they stop storing what&#x27;s essentially their customers&#x27; passwords in the clear or at least add a passphrase but they claim their security is top notch and I shouldn&#x27;t be worried: about a third party having direct access to our internal network while they store all the vpn keys in the clear.<p>Am I paranoid here ?",
