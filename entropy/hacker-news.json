This recruiter likely has an arrangement to be paid ~15-30% of your first year&#x27;s base salary.<p>If you&#x27;re a candidate who found a company through this recruiter, do you prefer to let them help with the negotiations be pre-screening the offer, sharing comp expectation with them, or even letting them negotiate on your behalf?<p>How about the other way around? If you&#x27;re a hiring manager working with a recruiting agency, do you shop the offer to them before the candidate? Do you just negotiate directly with the candidate and sideline the recruiter (even if they ask you not to?)<p>There are multiple incentives at play here and I&#x27;m curious how folks approach this.",
