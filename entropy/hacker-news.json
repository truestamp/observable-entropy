      "text": "As I keep listening to various biology&#x2F;biotech related podcasts, sometimes the research related information is being intercepted with statements like &quot;...and on the basis of these ground breaking results in yeast&#x2F;mice&#x2F;salamanders&#x2F;axolotls&#x2F;etc animals&#x2F;a dozen of patients we founded a company for more in-depth research&quot;. There are no mentions about MVPs, business models, interactions with customers, funding, profits etc. I was curious how do such companies whose main activity seems to be the conduction of basic _cutting_edge_ biotech research with still a far goal of a broader application in humans do exist financially. Is it all about just getting a right long-term funding?",
