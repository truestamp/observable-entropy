      "text": "TL;DR: Play: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freeboardgames.org Repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freeboardgames&#x2F;FreeBoardGames.org Docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freeboardgames.org&#x2F;docs<p>Hello HN,<p>I have started FBG some years ago when I moved to the Bay Area and could not find a simple, cross-platform, no-registration way to play board games with my friends back in my home country. I also wanted to make it simple to create multiplayer board games online for developers in their free time.<p>Shortly after, I found out about boardgame.io with similar goals and decided to join forces with them. It became the engine of our board games, and we focused on publishing&#x2F;serving them. To be fair with everyone and inspired by Wikipedia, we made the project a non-profit with GPLv3 Affero license.<p>Since then, the project has gotten many amazing contributors that developed really cool board games, added translations, helped with infra, etc (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freeboardgames.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;about ...). My focus has been on the infrastructure (scaling, adding text chat, etc).<p>During the pandemic, we saw a large 30x increase in usage, and it also became more useful for me, as I started using it at work for (now virtual) fun team meeting events.<p>Please check it out and give any feedback! I&#x27;ve been postponing submitting on HN for a long time because I always felt it &quot;wasn&#x27;t ready enough&quot; as there are a ton of rough edges, but I came to the realization that this feeling might never go away.",

      "text": "Learn from a predatory loan victim and just teach yourself to program. Hindsight is 20&#x2F;20.<p>I get it; I made a bad decision and signed a $30k contract for for 7 months of &quot;Education&quot; under the guided assumption I would immediately (or at least quickly) get a job after with my newly developed skills (Web Development(Node.React)&#x2F;Computer Science Track 2018). I was poor af at the time and $50k a year was way more than I could ever make doing what I was doing. \nThis did not happen. I did not get a job making over $50k.\nAfter several months, I took a crap PHP job making $12 an hour. A family member worked for the company and got me the job. I figured, at least I&#x27;d be learning a new skill and decided it was better than making considerably more money bartending.<p>I worked there full-time for a year and then part-time for another year leveling up my PHP&#x2F;Laravel skills as well as devoppsy stuff (They had their own server. It was actually pretty cool). The reason I went part-time was to pursue a crypto venture with some friends, also written in PHP&#x2F;Laravel but included Vue as well. I got pretty proficient in Vue over the year and had that project as well as some others to show for it. Using these projects in my portfolio, I landed a much better job.\nI started doing some Vue contract work for an actual software company and, after a few months, they hired me full-time.<p>2021, over two years after completing Lambda School, I got a over $50k paying job which I was qualified for due to my two years of programming experience. For, the icing on top, the past two years haven&#x27;t even been related to what the Lambda curriculum was. I haven&#x27;t even used those technologies since 2018.<p>Here I am now, obligated to pay %17 percent of my pretax income for a course I did years ago that didn&#x27;t help me at all get to where I am now. How is that fair? I&#x27;m pretty sure I have no legal basis as a contract is a contract, but this is just wrong.<p>There has to be many people in this same boat; A lot can happen in 2 years, let alone 5! I&#x27;d like to hear some feedback on this.",
