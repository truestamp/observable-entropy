      "text": "I&#x27;ve looked at various graphs of COVID indicators (infections, hospitalisations, deaths) along with the dates of mask mandates and would expect to see some kind of effect of the mandates on these indicators, but I can&#x27;t personally see anything (even squinting).  But perhaps AI can detect such effects, given that it is able (unexpectedly) to detect a subject&#x27;s race from chest X-rays and other medical imaging [1] and no-one really knows how.  Has anyone tried this?  Train your model on indicators and mandate dates, test you model by attempting to predict the dates of mandates (if any) using only the indicators?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;wx5ypb&#x2F;ai-can-guess-your-race-based-on-x-rays-and-researchers-dont-know-how",
