I forget what I want to write by the time the app opens up, I click on new note, cancel the upgrade dialog box, click on the text area to type after accidentally clicking on the template icon and waiting for it to close. WTH Evernote!<p>Where to go next? I already use onenote at work and the stupid thing mixes my personal and work notes when I add my personal account.<p>I use a windows PC. So apple notes is out.<p>Google Keep is a fleeting product. The moment you feel settled in they’ll uproot it.",
