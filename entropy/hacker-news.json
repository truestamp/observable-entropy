      "text": "I’m trying to understand how to evaluate offers that include options grants, which I’ve never done before. I’m starting to get a handle on what pieces of data are useful in evaluating their value, but I don’t know what’s common and tactful to ask and what’s generally off-limits. I assume shares outstanding is a pretty common question, but I’m not sure about e.g. info on liquidation preference, purchase price, funding round values, etc. So: what questions do you ask a startup when evaluating their offers?",
