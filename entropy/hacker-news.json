      "text": "I&#x27;m building DoTenX, which is a platform to build no-code automations (like Zapier). Unlike Zapier though, you can use DoTenX to build automations for others!<p>This means you can use DoTenX automations as the back-end of your applications or you can just use certain automations as helper APIs.<p>At this stage, you can build automations, and we&#x27;re making the cloud version ready for high volume traffic. Soon the 2nd part which helps you use DoTenX as a no-code backend will be released.<p>If you&#x27;re using Zapier or other alternatives, would love to have a chat and we can give you the same integrations at a very different price. On DoTenX you&#x27;ll pay $15 per 100K tasks per month.<p>If anyone is interested to actively use the platform as well, happy to have a chat to give you access and implement the Tasks and Triggers you need. You can use 30K tasks per month for free.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotenx&#x2F;dotenx",
