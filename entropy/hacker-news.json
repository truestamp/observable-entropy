      "text": "After working for 16 years, I’m at a crossroads in my career where I want a change and have a few different opportunities in front of me. I have 3 kids and am very dedicated to my family (like to be a big part of their lives). One of the opportunities is new and challenging whereas the other is more familiar and cushier (roughly same comp and upside). How should I choose?<p>Wondering if anyone can shed some guidance or personal stories about having a really challenging career and the reward that came with it.<p>My gut feeling is to run towards the challenge because it makes you stronger and you generally feel better when overcoming them. My example is being a parent. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done and it’s by far the most rewarding. I seem to look back and find myself most proud of the difficult challenges. Would love to hear your thoughts.",
