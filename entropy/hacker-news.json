      "text": "Again searching for a not used-car-salesman-like company to use with my mother. She&#x27;s unsteady enough on her feet to warrant getting a medical alert wearable. But all the companies (Life Alert, etc.) I easily find online are pretty much the same as the last time I looked (5 years ago) save for https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unaliwear.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;kanega-watch&#x2F;. Unfortunately, mom&#x27;s arthritis makes a watch not very practical.<p>Any new companies, products, services out there disrupting the medical alert system?<p>Thanks, as always, for your help HN!!",
