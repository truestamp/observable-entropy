      "text": "Can you relax without a screen?<p>Today I did something I haven’t done for years:<p>I lay on the couch, put on my headphones, and listened to music.<p>Nothing else, just listened to music. Sure enough, I stopped after 2 songs. Got bored. Needed a little more stimulus.<p>They say it’s about dopamine baseline. Scrolling instagram is 10x stronger dose than listening to a good song. If you scroll Instagram every 2 hours, then just music is not really much of pleasure.<p>I think this just might be behind this burnout generation. I have many times find myself absolutely unwilling to clean my house or take out the trash. It wasn’t always like this. Years ago, I would’ve found pleasure in doing those things.<p>Now I simply don’t.<p>Is it really too much screen time? Is my dopamine baseline all out of whack? Or am I burnt out? Do I need to take 6 month sabbatical?<p>I wonder if anyone else is going through this sort of thing.",
