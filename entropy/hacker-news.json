      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I have recently came across [0] and loved the idea. I wrote a script that plays the tron game (bikes leaving a line of light behind). My script got me through to the place 486th out of 6790. I&#x27;m fascinated about this idea and would like to use the motivation momentum and I study the subject, can you suggest good books on this field?<p>I&#x27;d like to tackle more complex environments too where bot have to make decision between different strategies to maximize the chance to win. They had a contest [1] a few days ago where player was controlling 3 heroes to defend against spiders and other players. So I think it&#x27;s not something I can solve with some fancy version of min-max?<p>I have run search on amazon and found a few picks, I would love to get some worthy recommendations..<p>* Game Hacking: Developing Autonomous Bots for Online Games by Nick Cano [2]<p>* Game AI Pro 360: Guide to Tactics and Strategy by Steve Rabin [3]<p>* 75 pages of results when searching for Game Theory [4]<p>--refs--<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codingame.com&#x2F;multiplayer&#x2F;bot-programming&#x2F;line-racing<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codingame.com&#x2F;contests&#x2F;spring-challenge-2022<p>[2] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;Game-Hacking-Developing-Autonomous-Online&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1593276699&#x2F;ref=sr_1_5?crid=ONIHKGSP235&amp;keywords=bot&amp;qid=1651565248&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=bot%2Cstripbooks%2C91&amp;sr=1-5<p>[3] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;Game-AI-Pro-360-Strategy&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0367150883&#x2F;ref=sr_1_21?crid=3RPZIO8W1MJ2I&amp;keywords=game+bot&amp;qid=1651565682&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=game+bot%2Cstripbooks%2C90&amp;sr=1-21<p>[4] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;s?k=game+theory&amp;i=stripbooks&amp;crid=1DSAWKMLM9G7A&amp;sprefix=game+theory%2Cstripbooks%2C106&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1",
