      "text": "Hello, Belatedly getting into Kubernetes at a large corp ... for which there is support for K8s. However, it&#x27;s often sprinkled with Ansible, Terraform too. Now according to the books I&#x27;ve been reading, K8 does not need help from other deployment&#x2F;orchestration to tools to move in container images. This brings me to my question:<p>I want to stay lean and mean. To that end,<p>(1) True&#x2F;false: kubeadmn is sufficient to deploy new images and otherwise bring containers through their life cycle.<p>(2) If false --- I see the K8 REST&#x2F;HTTP API is very large --- is there a GO library that helps me make calls into K8 to take containers through their life-cycle.<p>I believe, in our case, Ansible and Terraform were sprinkled in to a certain task&#x2F;library set for reasons pre-dating K8. K8 was added later as an alternative, now preferred way to deal with CDCI. By answering those questions above I will be able able to assess whether I should or should not be distracted by this other noise.",
