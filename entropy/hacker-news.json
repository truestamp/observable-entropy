      "text": "Which social media app do you think has the best design? This can include UX or UI design. Apparently most people don&#x27;t pay attention to fonts, symbols and other stuff closely, but for those of us that do, which app speaks to you the most? This can really be any app, but preferably one of the more known social media apps.<p>For me, I&#x27;ve used Twitter probably the most by far, so I might be biased. They have a great black dark mode. The font is genuinely so cool. The high contrast labels and icons are so pleasing to look at.  The profile pages are cool and overall, the app layout makes the most sense to me in terms of the replies and features. Apparently Twitter is one of the more confusing apps to use, but Reddit is insanely confusing to me. When you look at social media and the internet overall, Twitter and Bootstrap seem to have had the biggest influence on app and website design, so many apps have similar features that Twitter does.<p>My least favorite is probably Reddit and Snapchat. Snapchat is pretty smooth to use, but the colors and bubble-like design just doesn&#x27;t do it for me, and the profiles and searching thing is very confusing. Reddit is just a horrifically slow app and replies to posts are insanely annoying to sift through. I find myself closing every first tier replies so I can read replies instead if replies to replies. It&#x27;s a confusing mess and there&#x27;s just about nothing on the app that makes sense to me, which is interesting considering Quora, Twitter and Reddit are essentially the same thing and apparently had some of the same people on their design teams.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of more stuff I like about Twitter, but the main thing is that fact that I prefer Twitter&#x27;s design in general over other apps.<p>What about you?",
