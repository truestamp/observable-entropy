Sure, there will always be a need for SRE&#x2F;DevOps folks at large corps, but more and more PaaS seems to eliminating the complexity that my role is tasked with tackling.<p>Add to this that I really just like writing code. I feel like I write less code than ever before, and it&#x27;s more an exercise in admin&#x27;ing services that come either prebuilt in the SaaS case or are generally stable in the run-it-yourself case.<p>Any advice on how to pivot? I&#x27;m still young and I&#x27;ve moved vertically pretty quick in my career. I just want to design systems and get in the &quot;nitty-gritty&quot; again.",

      "text": "This is an old lib I just rejuvenated, adding support for Unicode RegExps, properly handling back-references, and taking advantage of these to create helpers that make accessible things that are usually too impractical to use.<p>It lets you write anything you&#x27;d write with normal RegExps, but with a more readable syntax, and it lets you compose sub-expressions into larger patterns.<p>It also provides helpers like:<p>- `atomic()` that prevents the engine from backtracking into what you passed as argument. No more ReDOS.<p>- `bound()` works like `\\b` but for arbitrary character sets. E.g. `bound(&#x2F;[_\\p{L}\\p{Number}]&#x2F;u)` is a Unicode-aware `\\b`<p>- Set operations on character classes: `charSet.intersection(&#x2F;\\p{Lowercase}&#x2F;u, &#x2F;\\p{Script=Greek}&#x2F;u)` will only match lower case greek letters<p>I hope you&#x27;ll find it useful!",
