Snorkel.org were pioneers of this approach.<p>Would love to hear any real world tales of trying it! What worked well and what didn&#x27;t? How easy was it to get domain experts to write the rules? How did you mix ground truth data with probabilistic labels? that sort of thing.<p>context: we&#x27;re building tools in this space.",
