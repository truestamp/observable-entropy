But sometimes it just breaks down.\nEither it throws an error that I can&#x27;t debug.<p>Or it stops activating modes that I hooked to specific buffers. TBH, I don&#x27;t even know what major and minor modes are. And if two major modes can be active at the same time?<p>1. What are some good resources on Emacs?\n2. If you use Emacs as your primary editor, how long did it take you to understand enough internals to be able to debug issues?\n3. If you use doom&#x2F;spacemacs, do you feel the bloat?<p>Thanks",
