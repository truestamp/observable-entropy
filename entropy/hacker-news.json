      "text": "I found out a few weeks ago that Bing has removed the documentation site for the open source project benthos (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.benthos.dev) from search results. I set up their webmaster tools and tried to get answers that way but all I get is a vague &quot;URL cannot appear on Bing&quot; answer, I then opened a support ticket and they still haven&#x27;t answered after three weeks.<p>When I open a search (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bing.com&#x2F;search?q=benthos.dev) at the bottom there is a &quot;Some results have been removed&quot; link that lead me down a rabbit hole. There&#x27;s a reports hub with some documents regarding site take downs but I can&#x27;t find anything specific.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I can do now other than wait and hope the support ticket eventually gets answered. If I could narrow it down to even just a copyright claim versus harmful content maybe I could work out where the problem is.",
