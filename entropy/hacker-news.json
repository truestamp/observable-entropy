      "text": "I had an idea for a site with a UI modeled after the minimalism of Hacker News, but every user has their own syndication feed, and NO KARMA SYSTEM.<p>I cannot stress enough how toxic the karma system is. I believe online bullying is real, flag systems, and moderators are necessary. But Karma systems are often abused by punishing users for expressing opposing views. I believe this is part of what sculpts ecosystems into echo chambers. When someone gets downvoted, no matter the reason, they receive posting restrictions, bans, etc.<p>Why can’t there be a balance where users can post what they want as long as it isn’t bigoted and have their own personal feeds?",
