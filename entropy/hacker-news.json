      "text": "It&#x27;s a compiled language with Ruby-inspired syntax (but not identical to Ruby). It has fast performance and a good standard library. Version 1.0 of the language was released in March 2021.<p>Some disadvantages:<p>- Compilation is a bit slow<p>- Small community<p>- Few learning resources<p>- Windows version is still under development (not 1.0 ready)<p>I&#x27;m impressed by the language and find it very likable. It&#x27;s not often discussed on HN, which is a shame.<p>If you are using Crystal, or have taken a look at the language, what are you thoughts on the language?",
