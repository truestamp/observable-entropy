I like building products after all.<p>There are so many great tools and strategies, but almost all of them require you to have a person or even a team to support it - for example all social media automation tools require you to prepare a lot of content to be effective. I can&#x27;t do that.<p>Do you know any great tools that are more or less 0 maintenance, relatively short setup and deliver value?<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to necessary be marketing tool, but it&#x27;s what made me curious.
