      "text": "It seems in the past 3 months, Twitter now is showing a lot more tweets in your timeline from ppl you dont follow. Based on topics you’ve liked, ppl whose tweets you interacted with once, or tweets most of your followers interacted with.<p>As a result, when I now open Twitter the first things I see are these awful self-help type threads from “gurus” with their long threads giving out advice. Or gifs&#x2F;memes that were taken from TikTok.<p>It has really ruined the Twitter experience for me. I guess i probably need to cut down my followers or use lists more.",
