      "text": "I just finished the book &#x27;Stolen Focus&#x27; (link below), and one thing that caught my attention other than of course the algorithms working to keep us constantly looking, I was wondering if there would ever be an incentive to create a social media site that only allows it to use it once a week.<p>One of the things the book asserts is that individual control isn&#x27;t sufficient, and it is the system which is the problem.<p>Would a social media site ever be successful where you can post, etc, but the site would aggregate the content and you can only view everyone else&#x27;s content only once a week?  It would help solve some issues like infinite scroll.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Stolen-Focus-Attention-Think-Deeply&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B09FYHKYFJ&#x2F;",
