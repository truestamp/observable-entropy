The problem we are having however is that we can&#x27;t find a reliable source of data. I know big companies like google have web crawlers, but Netflix will not let smaller companies scrape their sites as far as we can tell. Do you guys have any ideas as to how to gather information about what online tv services have which shows, and then compile that into a database?",
