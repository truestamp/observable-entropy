Both reading articles or listening via text to speech when on the go.<p>I use Pocket currently to save articles and listen but it doesn&#x27;t have the ability to order the queue.<p>My problem is I always jump around just reading the latest things I saved or come across rather than building myself a stricter curriculum and sticking to getting through it in a logical order.<p>Does anyone else do something like this to structure your personal study and how do you do it?<p>Cheers!",

People say the hardest part is marketing but repetitive development is very boring. I will definitely choose a fun-ner side project than this if this fails. It&#x27;s such a tiring journey as a solo developer&#x2F;founder&#x2F;marketer.<p>The tech stack is Node.js and Angular.<p>Daspoll is a survey builder for everyone.",
