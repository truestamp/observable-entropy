      "text": "The recent discussion [1] on the Black formatter for Python had me thinking about whether there is any innovation still happening in the realm of code formatting. Most of the possible ways to format code in each language must have been tried by now, and I would expect we&#x27;ve converged on a narrow range of permutations purely for practical reasons. But recently I did see an interesting example [2] of Java formatting from the Boot library for Clojure, with a style that I had never seen before in that language.<p>Are there other major variants of code formatting style still being developed out there?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30130315<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;boot-clj&#x2F;boot&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;boot&#x2F;base&#x2F;src&#x2F;main&#x2F;java&#x2F;boot&#x2F;App.java",
