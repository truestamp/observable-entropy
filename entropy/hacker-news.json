      "text": "A recent thread[0] sheds light on how different hackers and crypto-enthusiasts see the term web3, or the future of the web. With VR&#x2F;AR entering the picture[1] this fragmentation grows.<p>This made me wonder how I see the future of the web, and would fellow HNers agree with?<p>For me the web3 term was already coined years ago with the Semantic Web. Then completely distorted &#x2F; replaced by reality: social networks. So what&#x27;s this web3&#x2F;crypto wave? Maybe we are already thinking about web4? Outside the web? Anyway, what is web1, web2, webX?<p>* web1 - Academic, hacker driven, early adopters<p>* web2 - Fully open to public, via blogs<p>* web3 - Semi-open, planet scale, mandatory social networks and apps built on personal data &#x2F; advertising.<p>* web4 - More divide: blockchains, various reality layers.<p>It&#x27;s clear we can&#x27;t go forward with the `web` term. It&#x27;s rather platforms than the web. Web1-2 went with the browser platform, web3 introduced the app&#x2F;portable device platform, the next paradigms will introduce new platforms and devices.<p>I guess we should say goodbye to the web idea, a generally available, `free` platform for all, with non-mandatory participation.<p>We are already in the mandatory era, where we all carry a device and connect to a network, being exploited 24&#x2F;7. Next, we will carry better devices (VR, AR) better exploiting us. If we say no to all devices, the the environment (IoT) will exploit us in a mandatory way.<p>I guess we can affirm the web, the ideal it represents, it&#x27;s dead.<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29727420<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ncoiotldS-8&amp;t=1s",
