I looked at one or two and then click the link for laurentiustamate94 &#x2F; serilog-enrichers-aspnetcore and eventually noticed it took me to this page:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;causlayer.orgs.hk&#x2F;laurentiustamate94&#x2F;serilog-enrichers-aspnetcore<p>A pretty exact copy. Everything works, though some links (like profile etc) take you to the real github.<p>Why would someone put that amount of work into this?<p>If you go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;causlayer.orgs.hk it&#x27;s a copy of the github home page with a fake login page!<p>Is this something github should be aware of? If so where would you report it?",
