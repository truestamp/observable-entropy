It was inspired by a post yesterday.<p>I have an idea that would cost me some money: a &quot;steelmanning&quot; educational institute. It would become a 501(c)(3) eventually, but of course it costs some money to get there. We would teach people how to do it, possibly with contests where experienced lawyers, judges, and debate coaches judge the contestants. What do you think?",

I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll give him a quick overview of what the company does and then maybe just chat about programming with him.<p>I&#x27;m also considering giving him a very easy coding task in Python - not for work, just to keep him busy? - but it&#x27;s difficult to gauge what&#x27;s appropriate here.<p>Any suggestions or advice from people who have done something similar in the past?",
