      "text": "As I am transitioning out of my father’s appraisal practice and starting my own, I am keen to modernize some of the workflow and build a second-brain to augment my own practice.<p>Part of this is taking work that we’ve done on spreadsheets and making it so I can have a mapped time series view of changes in the markets I serve (which help me fill out parts of the forms, and have a more informed view of how prices in different areas fluctuate over time&#x2F;historically&#x2F;etc). I have a bit of an SQL background, but that was more data wrangling than actual production work, so I fully understand I might not be informed on the best db for my use case.<p>Having it be self-hosted is my only caveat, as I would need access even if the internet is down, and I don’t trust cloud providers to do a better job than I can (used to work at one, so I am biased in that respect). Would most likely be hosting on a NAS&#x2F;Synology Box connected to my Desktop.<p>This would be nothing customer facing and is purely for my office to use as a competitive advantage over the majority of my older peers; Many of which while technically adept to an extent, but whose processes are still tied to “the way it’s always been done”.<p>If there are any things I can clarify or any additional questions you might have, I’ll be keeping an eye on the thread as I’m researching the houses we’ll be appraising later this week.<p>Thanks for any input!",
