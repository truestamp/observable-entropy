Of course this doesn&#x27;t mean that the specification can&#x27;t be acquired freely from elsewhere [2, 3], but it&#x27;s unfortunate if the authoritative source is down.

      "text": " Hi HN! We&#x27;re Sebas and Elias, and we are building Telekinesis: a serverless platform aimed to make it easy to deploy complex applications.<p>We love serverless because it abstracts away the infrastructure but we think we can take it a step further: abstract away the communication. Effectively, a place where you just code any function or class, we run it in the cloud, and then let you connect securely to it. To be truly easy, it has to support:<p>- stateful objects: you can instantiate classes and manipulate them through our secured websockets connection<p>- any pip&#x2F;npm package dependencies: we&#x27;ll keep a container with your dependencies ready to run your code when your service is invoked<p>Since now these services would be pure logic, we can efficiently compose them, just like with open source (pip or npm) packages. However, there would be one key difference, here you can put a price on your code. In this setup, developers could opt in to have their code become open source automatically after a certain amount of time or if it hits an income threshold.<p>We&#x27;re a long way from the &quot;function marketplace&quot; idea, but we have an early version of the serverless platform you can try at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telekinesis.cloud.<p>We are looking for our first users to try our product. We&#x27;re especially interested in working closely with anyone that&#x27;s building a prototype. If you are interested you can register for early access or email us at contact@telekinesis.cloud<p>Lastly, if you share any feedback below it would have an enormous value for us. Thanks everyone!",
