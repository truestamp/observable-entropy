      "text": "Hi HN. I asked a question here before. [my app is slow. What do I do now?](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29700098). HN users kindly instructed me to record logs about my api request as a starting point. I have done accordingly and found some slow api requests and fix them.<p>But recording api request and analysing them with custom python code is not as interesting as creating features for my app.<p>Are there any service that I can use to simplify this task?<p>I&#x27;ve used Mixpanel to collect and analyse my user behaviours. So far it is working great.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of using Mixpanel to collect and analyse my api request data. But I&#x27;m not sure Mixpanel is good fit for this task. (I&#x27;m not an expert in Mixpanel though).<p>Have you used any service to do such task? I would be happy to pay for the service.<p>Thanks :)",
