I tried uploading it on CodeCanyon but somehow they didn&#x27;t select it and also didn&#x27;t give me a reason.<p>I am going to start Google Ads soon with even more focus on SEO.<p>I got a few customers and improved the product as well from their feedback but the kind of traction I was looking for, I am yet to get it.<p>I want to take the opinion of experts here on what else I can do to speed up the sales.",
