      "text": "I know that there is a debate about storing all source code in a mono-repo vs multiple repos. \nI am thinking about it from a security perspective - a seperation to multiple repos reduces the risk of source code exposure&#x2F;leakage and enable more granular access. However, maybe this isn&#x27;t a high risk as having an insider threat or an account takeover that may inject a malicious code, so setting up codeowners will do the work even in a mono-repo.\nWhat are your thoughts?",
