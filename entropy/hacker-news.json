      "text": "Hey all.<p>Today the book on remote working that I wrote for The Pragmatic Bookshelf has gone into beta.<p>It&#x27;s called Effective Remote Working.<p>I didn&#x27;t plan on writing a second book, but 8 months ago during a conversation with the publisher we agreed that it was the right time for a book like this.<p>My first book was Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager, which I did a Show HN on before: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22033129<p>That book has so far been successful with lots of great reviews and over $100,000 in net sales.<p>A beta book with PragProg means that you get DRM-free access to the first 9 chapters, and the following 6 chapters will be delivered to your inbox as they&#x27;re finished off, along with any fixes.<p>It&#x27;s available with free excerpts here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pragprog.com&#x2F;titles&#x2F;jsrw&#x2F;effective-remote-work&#x2F;<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback, and if there are any bugs or errata then they can all be ironed about before the thing goes to print.<p>Once again, I&#x27;ve had a great experience writing for PragProg, and would highly recommend them for anyone who wants to write a book for our industry.<p>Thanks again, everyone.",
