      "text": "TL;DR: I am <i>terrified</i> of the possibility of being harmed as a result of exposing my (boring) thoughts on the Internet under my real identity. Should I do it anyway?<p>From time to time I get an urge to start some sort of &quot;online public brain dump&quot;: Make all my ideas accessible to anyone who may be interested. That would include anything from subjects I&#x27;ve learned to deeply personal things concerning my views on life and society, my mental health issues and so on. (For context, I&#x27;m in my mid-20s. I have zero online presence and not much of a social life.)<p>It seems what a lot of privacy-minded people do is keep the personal stuff separated, preferably anonymous, to protect their reputation, career or safety. I&#x27;d like to do <i>the opposite</i>, and have everything in the same place. These things are really inseparable in my mind and it just feels so wrong to pretend otherwise. I guess what I really want is to put myself out there, connect with real people in the real world by being friendly but genuine. I want to openly say stupid things not to argue but simply because <i>I actually believe in them</i>, I want to engage in honest discussions, I want to openly retract what I said when I change my mind.<p>But what I&#x27;ve been seeing done to people who are caught making mistakes makes me very afraid of showing that I, too, am human and make mistakes and have wrong opinions. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have particularly unique ideas, my opinions on most topics aren&#x27;t controversial and I&#x27;m very much against being inflammatory. Still, all I can think of when I&#x27;m about to make this idea concrete are horror stories: Being &quot;canceled&quot;, fired and kept from getting jobs, sued, doxxed, death-threatened, harrassed to the point of committing suicide... I&#x27;m no Snowden or Scott Alexander, but &quot;the Internet never forgets&quot;.<p>So, HN, what are your thoughts on this? Do you feel similarly? How &quot;yourself&quot; are you online? Is my fear just paranoia and I should &quot;just do it&quot;, or, in the contrary, am I being naïve for wanting to do it?<p>If you&#x27;ve read all this, thanks and sorry for the rambling.",
