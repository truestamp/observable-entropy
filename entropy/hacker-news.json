      "text": "Is anyone aware of a company like this that exists?<p>The problem:\nYou want to hire the best, and sometimes the best person is not willing or able to move to your country. International employment law is very complex.<p>You want to access hires who are not willing to work as independent contractors &#x2F; freelancers, or you want to hire a long term member of staff and would prefer to hire someone who likes to work perm.<p>Solution:\nThis company has virtual offices all over the world, and will hire your perm staffer, or create a company for you to hire them through. They handle the legals, payroll, etc - like an agency, and always use your branding to communicate with the new hire, giving them a direct hire experience.<p>Contracts between your company and the hiring company ensure that you are on the hook for any obligations the hiring company has to their employees.<p>Umbrella companies exist, and agencies exist. This is really just an umbrella with a bit of a branding twist and more mutual obligation.",
