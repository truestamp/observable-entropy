Right now I&#x27;m overwhelmed by the number of things that needs to be handled and learn and don&#x27;t really have many seniors I can lean on for help and guidance.<p>I&#x27;d like to look for a new role and a more suitable workload but even then I am overwhelmed by the interview preparation grind. I&#x27;d like to be able to resign and take time off to focus solely on finding a new role with a more manageable workload but I have bills and loans to pay and a family to support (though this is perhaps adding to my feeling of stress and overwhelm) and would like to burn my savings only as matter of last resort. (but how do I know if I&#x27;m at that point?)<p>Things I have tried or am currently doing:<p><pre><code>  - prioritizing sleep and exercise and eating well\n  - meditation, maintaining my mental health with biweekly visits to a therapist\n  - delegating tasks to juniors (which doesn&#x27;t end as well as I&#x27;d hope)\n</code></pre>\nThings I am working on:<p><pre><code>  - prioritizing. everything feels so important yet at the end of the day it just feels like I&#x27;m spinning my wheels without making much progress on anything\n</code></pre>\nAny tips or suggestions?",
