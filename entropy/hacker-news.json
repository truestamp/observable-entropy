      "text": "I have a BS and MS in computer science and I have been working part-time on my PhD in compilers for four years now. My research is about attribute grammars. I love my PhD research topic and it&#x27;s novel but I don&#x27;t see it being used for any practical applications. I teach basic compiler course part-time as an instructor at my university as well. I work full-time as a backend software engineer at Microsoft.<p>My goal is to actually use the concept I spend so much in my PhD in my career. Where should I start? What is a must know for a compiler engineer? What are the companies that do exciting stuff in compilers?",
