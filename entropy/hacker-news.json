      "text": "All I see on Twitter is people with massive MRRs sharing their experience. That is good. It&#x27;s remarkable to see their path.<p>But where is the reality? Where are the people with currently $0 MRR who are struggling? We want to see those. Community is at its best when supporting each other. When they share their wins AND the Loses.<p>I&#x27;ll go first. I&#x27;m taking on a short challenge for 30 days - The goal is to reach 100 followers by the end of the month.<p>Share your current challenge. I&#x27;d love to be a part of it.<p>Here&#x27;s mine: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;shubmakes&#x2F;status&#x2F;1477662969290846211",

In addition, we do regular user interviews.<p>All the feedback is super helpful, and we usually try to group it on a Miro whiteboard with post-its and some counter about how often a point gets mentioned.<p>Is there a better and more structured way to do that? What tools and techniques do you use to keep track of your user feedback? Do you have some kind of routine of regularly going through all the past feedback and comparing it with your product roadmap?",
