      "text": "For my startup, I have a project which has TypeScript server and client app. Workflow is much better while using mono repo with npm workspaces. Right now I am the only developer, thats fine. I am paranoid about the situation when I have multiple developer working on this project. With monorepo developers will have access to all code. Isn&#x27;t it risky when one of developer go rouge and use the code to deploy it in his own server and market it? Isn&#x27;t it especially risky for startup which less legal resource.<p>Sometime, I feel it is good approach to have server and client in different repo and have 2 different team dealing with it and have common code in git submodules. With this approach at least 2 developer have to go rouge, which is less probable.<p>What do you thing about this situation. Am I overthinking about situation? Is this the common problem, if so how organisations deal with it?",
