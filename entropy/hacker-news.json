The amount of noise in channels is extreme due to the low friction that Slack allows for one word channel responses, or people posting just an emoji or gif.<p>It seems like a huge amount of noise could be eliminated if Slack (or other work chat apps) required a minimum amount of characters for a channel post.<p>Does anyone know of a work chat app that allows for this requirement?<p>(For 1:1 chat, I can see not having this restriction. But having say, 100 character minimum post requirement for all channel posts seems like it would force really good chat edict - as well help reduce the “Slack stress” we’ve all come to experience)",
