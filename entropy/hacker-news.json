It can be lack of knowledge as well but to me blockchains just seem like extremely inefficient form of DBs<p>The only comment I have seen is that they allow decentralization. But then why would it make sense for them to use for private companies, banks etc. ?<p>Note than I am not talking about Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. I am more interested in the basic tech on which these platforms are built.",

Some people say it is a boring a job, other people may say it is stagnant. Also, even though there are very few COBOL programmers, it is hard to estimate how good or common are job offers.<p>So, the question is: Is it worth to learn COBOL?",
