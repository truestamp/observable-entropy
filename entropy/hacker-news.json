      "text": "Hi, I work on IT as, I think, 99% of the readers. That was my main field for the last 20 years.<p>So, for me, working in a tech field and in a inflationary economy was not a problem. I ask for a rise to pair that, if they don&#x27;t want to give me that, I move, period. It is easy.<p>The question is, how is your no-IT family, relatives, friends dealing with that? It is harder for them? How they approach the problem that, at the end of the month, their salary is less?<p>My question comes from my own couple, she is an occupational therapist, and the field is not unionized, and managed by nearly 4 big companies. Almost no rise for the last 14 years and when I approach my solution is obviously not applicable becaus the context.<p>Thanks",
