Public info is at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ghacks.net&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;20&#x2F;google-ends-the-g-suite-legacy-free-edition-leaving-users-worried&#x2F;<p>They intend to have a free tier, but without the most important feature, e-mail at your existing e-mail address. I&#x27;ve set up my kids with e-mail addresses from this domain, and have a couple accounts myself, for ten accounts in all. The cheapest paid option is going to be $6 (USD, presumably) &#x2F; month &#x2F; account, or $720&#x2F;year for the 10 accounts, which is a non-starter, as I&#x27;m not using this for a business.<p>If possible, I&#x27;d like to keep the e-mail accounts working. I am able to administer my DNS settings, so changing the, uh, MX records shouldn&#x27;t be too hard.<p>What options should I look at? I gather that running your own e-mail server is horrible unless you want to spend your life running the server. Are there inexpensive services that will host e-mail with custom domains?",

Unfortunately I do not speak French which makes it a bit hard for me to search trough the official Frech GOV websites.<p>I tried https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.gouv.fr&#x2F; - yet it _seems_ that it is not there. Is there please:<p><pre><code>  - a dataset (API) of district-wise results of previous elections? (Presidential, Regional, ...)\n\n  - is there a live API during the vote counting which provides information from the districts which already finished the count?\n\n</code></pre>\nI hope that there is a French crowd here as well :)<p>Thanks a lot!",
