Given that, I would like to ask you for resources about converting Markdown to HTML, maybe something like [2] or a relatively-small sized project like [3].<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28837760<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interpreterbook.com&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pypi.org&#x2F;project&#x2F;Markdown&#x2F;",
