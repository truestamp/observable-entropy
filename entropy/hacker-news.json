      "text": "VonNewmann&#x27;s architecture has been around for quite a while - and as a software engineer I am very grateful for that, don&#x27;t get me wrong. On the other hand, new programming languages keep popping up every year - okay, I&#x27;m being a bit dramatic here.<p>Is there any interesting project or study in the computer architecture space you would recommend? Particularly one where it could eventually compete with VonNeumann&#x27;s for the mainstream or more specifically to compete for personal computing in large scale?<p>My thoughts on this come from this paper - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;359576.359579 and this video from Bell Labs back in the day - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;tc4ROCJYbm0",
