I read a bunch of Reddit&#x2F;HN threads that are opinionated for high-res&#x2F;ultrawide&#x2F;high-refresh as ideal setups. I wanted to get an idea of the current consensus around this.\nWhat would you recommend?",

      "text": "My opinion about this constantly changes through my programming experience. Functions longer than 20 lines of code? Pffff, an algorithm&#x2F;problem can be such complex in nutshell and decomposing a function solving it will be non-relevant (see any std library of PL). Mutable global state? Pfff, anything in software is based on that, the problem is using it properly in target architecture (ex. in micro-controllers global state usually manages analog&#x2F;digital output, calling a function for this adds memory and time overhead especially in real-time systems). Copy-paste? Pfff, similar code != this code solves the same problem, sometimes it&#x27;s easier to include a change in &quot;copy-paste&quot; code than deciding how to include this in boundaries of &quot;reusable&quot; parts (ex. for the first time there&#x27;re two structures X = (A, B) and Y = (A, B) with similar logic but different domains, and then manager decides to include specific logic for Y working with B data).<p>Now my general principle which distinguishes &quot;good&quot; code from &quot;bad&quot; one, is how good it resembles a model solving given problem. It can be a non-neccessary complexity of code (ex. instead of &quot;if (isFinite(a)) { ... }&quot; writing &quot;if (a.toString() != &quot;Inifinity&quot; &amp;&amp; a.toString() != &quot;NaN&quot;) { ... }&quot; when &quot;a&quot; is simply a number). And contrary not-enough complexity of code, relying on blind faith (famous XSS vulnerabilities, SQL injections in web apps are examples of that).",
