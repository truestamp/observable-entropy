      "text": "I&#x27;m a British Software Engineer.\nI just discovered my South Korean fiance and has just been diagnosed with a terminal condition so I need to move over there ASAP.<p>I&#x27;ve got a CS degree and 1 and a half years experience at a large news organisation. In my team we manage a Web service written in elixir, all associated CI and aws infrastructure. I&#x27;ve been coding in python since I was 16 and java at uni. I&#x27;ve been learning Korean for the past year but its not business ready yet.<p>So my main question is, given my situation, how difficult would it be for me to get a job in Korea?<p>Other questions:\nHow common are English speaking software jobs there?\nCould I get a remote job for a company outside of Korea while still living there?\nDoes anyone here have insight into Korean job visa or marriage visas on here, that could point me in the right direction?<p>Sorry if this isn&#x27;t concise or the questions are easily googleable, I&#x27;m still reeling from the news. I just thought this is the most likely place to get the best advice!<p>Thank you in advanced, your advice is greatly appreciated!",
