      "text": "The recent shutdown of SSLPing and related comments made me think. There are so many generous individuals or organisations who host open source services for free on their infrastructure. I&#x27;m thinking of federated networks like Matrix or Mastodon or utilities like Jitsi, Cyberchef or SSLPing. Useful things if you know where to find them. I know of a few gists and pastebins floating around but this is a poor solution in my opinion. Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to have a centralized or federated database with such tools combined with servers where they are hosted? Does this already exist somewhere?",
