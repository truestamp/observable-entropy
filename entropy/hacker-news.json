      "text": "Hi all,\nI&#x27;ve been thinking very deeply lately about GUIs, command lines, life, leisure, and work. These interests intertwine surprisingly often, especially if you have a poor memory, frantic excitability, and aptitude for creation and creativity.<p>My current setup is using an amazing AutoHotKey tool called &#x27;Radial Menu 4&#x27; by Learning One. That coupled with &#x27;Adventure&#x27; by Algumist, which has a built in GUI maker, provides for a complete workspace in one executable.<p>This here is the foundation for my portable fortress, which allows me to call and command anything from anywhere. Anything I can dream up of doing on a computer, I am able to do, store, and replicate in the future.<p>This allows me to store all my previous memories in life, as well as to store, sort and categorize all my work hacks and exploits. And naturally all my macros. All with amazing ad-hoc detail and notations&#x2F;markings.<p>My question is, has anyone here delved into anything similar - that is, one single exe which can infinitely extend itself - safely and persistently. This is the best solution I have found thus far and it truly augments my ailing brain, whilst giving me the complete power and versatility of command lines and GUIs.<p>I am extremely interested to hear about other all-in-one power centres!<p>[0] Https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autohotkey.com&#x2F;boards&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=12078<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autohotkey.com&#x2F;boards&#x2F;viewtopic.php?f=64&amp;t=89901",
