      "text": "I recently graduated with a degree in computational math. I took about 8-9 computer science courses. The most notable are probably C++, operating systems, and algorithms. I started the major late -- end of my second year. That meant that I had to take summer classes to graduate on time and didn&#x27;t have an internship until my Junior year summer. The internship was good, but it wasn&#x27;t at a big, reputable company. Now, I am looking for jobs. I have had reasonable success, but haven&#x27;t landed anything yet. I&#x27;ve applied to a few hundred positions, but I&#x27;ve only been interviewed by 6. Of those, I&#x27;ve made it to the onsite 3 times now. I made it through one and got axed by the manager, didn&#x27;t pass another, and have the third coming up. I also currently have a job, but I really want to leave it because my manager essentially lied to, telling me it was a software engineering role when really all I do is excel all day.<p>I am wondering whether you think it is worth it to try a bootcamp if this next onsite doesn&#x27;t go my way? I&#x27;m desperate to leave my job, but I&#x27;ve heard mixed things about bootcamps.",
