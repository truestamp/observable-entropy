      "text": "I have been using excel + data from sql queries to spot upward or downward trends on business metrics (e.g. daily, week over week, month of month, actives, revenue, etc...) everyday.<p>It comes to a point that it&#x27;s prone error, missed oversight, or not catching it fast enough.<p>While IT &amp; Reporting team may eventually have an trend spotting &#x2F; alert solution, I wonder whether there are quick and dirty solution with existing frameworks, R packages, or some form of automation that I can install on my mac that would raise alerts on metrics that are in trouble based on rules that I set.<p>Of course, any cs101 student can create such program. But I wonder whether such a solution already exists that one can run quickly on their own machine before running it on a broader IT infrastructure.<p>Any comment will be appreciated!",
