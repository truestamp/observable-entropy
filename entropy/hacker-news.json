Yes, I was &quot;forced&quot; to switch from my old Android phone to something newer, and yes, I use both platforms - Windows and OS X (M1 MBA), and I had before an iPhone (old 4S), so I wanted to give it a try, picked an iPhone 13 and start using it.<p>And then, just last week, I realized on my vacation, shooting some videos, that you can&#x27;t pause the video recording. And I went crazy, like really, in 2022. where an Chinese Android phone for 150 USD can do that, the mighty flagship of Apple can&#x27;t do that, and you know what else can&#x27;t do? For some reason, iPhone 13 can&#x27;t switch from back to front camera while recording.<p>In the era of TikTokers and vlogers, this can&#x27;t be done..<p>Yeah, my rant is over, now I listen your rants :) Thank you!",
