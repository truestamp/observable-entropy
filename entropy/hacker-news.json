      "text": "I know that they never were excellent, but I remember them being quite good on day to day mainstream tech events. But now, whenever I open it, it feels like reading BuzzFeed or some other dumpster fire.<p>To give an example which was published just today: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;4&#x2F;5&#x2F;23011810&#x2F;elon-musk-twitter-sec-board-member-moderation<p>It starts with: &quot;Ahahahahahaha fine. Longtime shitposter Elon Musk, who has a side gig as the CEO of Tesla, is on the board of Twitter, a newly minted meme stonk, after filing the wrong form with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tremendous content.&quot;<p>So, question: does anybody else feel that way or was it always shit and I just didn&#x27;t notice or am I just growing old?<p>Lastly, any recommendations on good mainstream day to day tech sites&#x2F;blogs (as I won&#x27;t be reading this trash anymore)?",
