      "text": "My money is spread out over checking&#x2F;savings&#x2F;high-yield accounts. I have more in an IRA, but am not counting it since it&#x27;s considered off-limits.<p>But ever since I started working for myself, I can&#x27;t seem to shake the anxiety I have concerning money. It never feels like I have enough. I can never relax. Is this normal? Before quitting my job, I had about $60k, which slowly dwindled down to $2k until my new business was able to give me a livable wage.<p>Savings are slowly growing again, but I still have constant anxiety about money, which I never had before. Having watched my savings dwindle so far probably attributes to my subconscious anxiety.<p>What can I do? Any advice?",
