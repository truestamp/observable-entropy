      "text": "A comment [1] on a recent HN discussion got me to looking for a structured open source data set for guitar tabs. So far I have not been able to find anything too promising.<p>There are several great open source applications for creating and maintaining personal collections of tabs as well as several libraries and services that will scrape tabs from UG, but there does not seem to be any kind of community maintained set of guitar tabs. Can anyone point me to something I am missing here?<p>My vision would be something similar to the Radio Browser [2] which maintains a dataset (of online radio stations) used by several open source apps. When a user of one of the apps contributes a new station, it benefits all the users of the other apps too....<p>Would also be curious on folks thoughts on the licensing of such a collection. Does not seem like UG is paying any licensing fees for its user-contributed tabs, but it feels like if it was as easy as creating a public DB of tab files on GitHub, someone would have done it already....<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29469528<p>2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radio-browser.info&#x2F;",
