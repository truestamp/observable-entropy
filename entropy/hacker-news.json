Do small (but maybe significant?) differences or unique products (e.g. Spanner) make such a big difference that it has swayed someone to switch their cloud infrastructure?<p>I wonder how much these little things matter and how such a transition (in partial or as a whole) went along and how key stakeholders (who were possibly heavily invested in one cloud or felt they were responsible for the initial choice) were convinced to make the switch?<p>I&#x27;d love to hear some stories from real world experiences and crucially what it was that pushed the last domino to make the move.",
