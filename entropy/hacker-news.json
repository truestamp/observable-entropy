      "text": "I find myself technically smart, able to understand concepts and well suited for early stage development where I can follow the reasoning behind choices that are made.  When I join legacy or in process projects, I find myself questioning why choices are made.  Like most of you (I guess), a lot of the people I work with don&#x27;t document anything, or have limited documentation from the origin of the project, and middle &#x2F; upper management isn&#x27;t really technical.  I can follow high level flows, but I make lots of mistakes on projects with lots of moving parts.   I try not to get into the mindset that the more senior people on the project are withholding information from me, but that leads me to believe that I&#x27;m not where I should be technically.<p>I&#x27;m starting to second guess myself a lot more, more so on older projects that I&#x27;m throw into.  I&#x27;m reaching out to older teammates and asking them about my past performance and how my current projects are, and they all say I was ok, and that these projects are also the norm.<p>Is this usually the case?  Is there a direction I should go to avoid making the same mistakes?  Do you sometimes spend 2 days troubleshooting an error that you caused yourself?",
