They use Google Classroom for assignments and other communications.<p>I bought him a Chromebook for schoolwork, but also for other private things. When we logged in, the system installed GoGuardian monitoring software on the Chromebook without notice or permission.<p>And now I can&#x27;t remove it. I wrote to GoGuardian support, and they replied that I had to contact the school or remove my son as a user. The instructions for removing him as a user do not work; on the contrary, I see the message &quot;cps.edu manages this user and may remotely manage settings and monitor user activity&quot; and he can&#x27;t be removed.<p>I did a full factory reset, signed in to his account again, and now the system is once again locked down.<p>So now I&#x27;m in the position where I have to ask permission from a local government entity to please let me install stuff and don&#x27;t monitor the computer I bought and paid for.<p>Does anyone know how to refer these people to law enforcement for prosecution?",
