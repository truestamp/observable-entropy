      "text": "Gearing up for a round of interviews and getting more serious about my prep.<p>So far I&#x27;ve been sticking with the old standbys:<p>- Leetcode: Good repository of questions, useful for daily practice, but the educational content leaves a lot to be desired. Some solutions are well written and comprehensive while others are poorly written or incomplete. Had the same experience with HackerRank and similar sites, Leetcode seems to still be the best overall.<p>- Cracking the Coding Interview: A classic, well written, has a lot of helpful insights, but somewhat out of date.<p>Looked at Interview Kickstart, but it seems to be a synchronous webinar format, which doesn&#x27;t fit my learning style. Also, expensive.<p>What other new resources might I be missing?",
