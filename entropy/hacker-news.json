      "text": "Hello,<p>I work as a full-time full stack developer.\nI provide for my family so I started looking to work extra hours on my free-time as my current job doesn&#x27;t offer doing extra time.\nI found a job for mentoring students (1h X 4 times a week). I find it hard because I have to keep an eye  on 2 or 3 different students.<p>So I think that a 3 or 4 days a month &quot;mission&quot; would better suite me.<p>Do you have any advice on how can I find a 3 or 4 days&#x2F;month side-job ?\n(I&#x27;m also considering looking for a better full-time job but in all cases I want to over work).<p>Regards",
