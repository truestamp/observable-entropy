      "text": "It might come down to taste, but I feel like a lot of the &quot;features&quot; Twitch has been adding have cluttered the interface while offering little of value for someone like me who just watches streams occasionally and isn&#x27;t closely involved in community events.<p>But most importantly, I&#x27;m bothered by the non-dismissable popups that now appear over the video feed. They seem to be for extensions, but what features they provide evades me.<p>These two uBlock Origin rules (which you can add in the My Filters tab) will remove the main two modals that can pop up over the video:<p><pre><code>  www.twitch.tv##.extensions-dock-card\n  ext-twitch.tv##.prime-extension-root\n</code></pre>\nAdditionally, you may want to get back a chat frame without a leaderboard header:<p><pre><code>  www.twitch.tv##.channel-leaderboard\n</code></pre>\nTwitch generates random class names, possibly to prevent your blocking some elements, so I tried to find the topmost classes. I hope that&#x27;s useful to some.",

      "text": "I know that there is a debate about storing all source code in a mono-repo vs multiple repos. \nI am thinking about it from a security perspective - a seperation to multiple repos reduces the risk of source code exposure&#x2F;leakage and enable more granular access. However, maybe this isn&#x27;t a high risk as having an insider threat or an account takeover that may inject a malicious code, so setting up codeowners will do the work even in a mono-repo.\nWhat are your thoughts?",
