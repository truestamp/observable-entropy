For example a standard &quot;www&quot; record.<p>It is widely considered a &quot;sub-domain&quot; but I&#x27;d argue it is not, but a &quot;regular&quot; hostname (in case of aforementioned record types) instead.<p>Reason for that logic would be that a (sub-)domain is a domain&#x2F;realm of entities (records managed via its nameservers). An A record would not satisfy such a definition.<p>Taken from Wikipedia<p>&gt; A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet.<p>Though Wikipedia also follows the standard definition - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Subdomain<p>I wonder if this is a similar misnaming as when people regularly confuse traffic and bandwidth.",

The low quality of UX on the iOS app  also contributed to taking the wrong  cues. Whereas i tried the same route on Apple Maps and it worked flawlessly.
