Wouldn&#x27;t that have shown a real belief in what they are doing?<p>If there are current legitimate legal risks to issuing all their publicly-sellable equity via an ICO? Why not do only some of it as crypto coins?<p>What&#x27;s stopping them from issuing a few coins even now? They don&#x27;t need to need the money. They need to prove that ICOs can work. They are the best placed company in the world to do this: are at the intersection between tradfi and defi, and exist in a country where regulations do exist and do get enforced.",
