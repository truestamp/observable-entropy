Over a year ago, I decided to change job (many years working there) and, after two intents working with some other teams&#x2F;companies, I realized that I do not want to work as a team lead anymore.<p>Although I should consider changing industry or even job&#x2F;sector, I want to say that IT job recruiting sucks, tech interviews suck and, last but not least, people who deliberately use MongoDB as a relational database sucks too, and still our is the most beautiful job in the world.<p>With love",

      "text": "In the years before the cloud became the new and exciting default for big and not-so-big data solutions, we had a relatively simple way to design and build data management projects. You had a database layer, maybe a data manipulation tool (if at all), and your efforts went into understanding and modelling the data. This was for all but the largest data volumes.<p>Now, cloud providers seem to have moved on to selling us these super-complex multi-services modern architectures. To implement those we are looking at more than 6-7, sometimes 10+ completely different technologies. From including your file storage (and calling it a data&#x2F;delta lake) in the mix, through clusters of compute instances on top of it (eg spark), then an mpp system besides those, etc, etc, we seem to be making it all quite complex, when in fact neither the data volume, variety or velocity demand such treatment. It does seem like we are just throwing more and more software to solve non-existing problems and feeding an army of professionals along the way. Sure, for huge setups it makes sense, but I’m seeing companies handling data sets which can fit in sqlite buying into this and just going with it for dubious reasons.<p>It does make sense from the point of view of cloud providers and consultancies and I am wondering if it seems a little over the top to everyone or just me..",
