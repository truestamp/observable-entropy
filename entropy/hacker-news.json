      "text": "I&#x27;m working on a new app and it will require some short video clips; I&#x27;m semi-set on using Vimeo over YouTube&#x2F;other options and wondering if others have run into any issues, or if this is generally not a good idea.  The app itself is more&#x2F;less a &#x27;workout app&#x27; though highly specialized, and will only need to show very short video clips around 10-20 seconds in most cases.  Long-term I could see offering students the ability to record&#x2F;upload their own videos for feedback from staff members, etc.<p>From what I&#x27;m seeing the Vimeo api looks like a really easy, clean and inexpensive option.<p>Thank you",
