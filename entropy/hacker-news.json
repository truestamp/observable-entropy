      "text": "I&#x27;ve found the Eufy option with local storage and it looks great, but still I have some privacy concerns. Also some people is complaining about delay with the notifications.<p>If possible I would like it to run with battery but I guess I could pass a cable.<p>Another feature that I find interesting is to be able to switch off the internet access and only allow within the local network when I&#x27;m at home.<p>In the future I would like to setup more home automation devices like the thermostat and an alarm system. So I guess I should go for an open source approach. The problem I see too many options out there and the hardware part is even more confusing to me. My developer skills are also very limited but I think I could learn this part.<p>So I would like to start with a good choice for my first device since my regular doorbell stopped working.",
