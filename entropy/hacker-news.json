      "text": "I feel that 10+ years back there used to be a lot of talk of a lot of technologies that would change the world following in the footsteps of Moore&#x27;s law (although a bit more slowly).<p>In the decade since a lot of exciting developments have happened. Smartphones have become cheaper, world is so much more connected, EVs looking to finally breakthrough etc.<p>However exponential tech that takes us to something like &#x27;singularity&#x27; does not seem to come up any more. Most growth is incremental and we hype every single Lab output with rarely seeing commercial breakthroughs.<p>I was personally always excited about material science breakthroughs using graphene etc. but seems like it is difficult to manufacture at scale even today.<p>Any specific tech or breakthrough you are personally waiting for coming to fruition ?",
