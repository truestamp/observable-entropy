      "text": "So, my situation is quite rare I think. I was doing a CS degree between ages 18 and 21, passed all the required courses, had a pretty decent grades, but then I dropped out right before the finish line because I picked the wrong bachelor thesis and couldn&#x27;t force myself to finish it at the time.<p>Right now I am 23 and working in my 3rd job as software developer (previous two were part time jobs during university, right now I am doing full time). I never had trouble getting a SWE job (always got multiple offers I could pick from) and keeping it, as I am passionate about programming and always had side projects etc. going on.<p>Given this circumstances, I am confident that I can have pretty solid software engineer career on my own, without getting the degree. However, recently there is a voice in my brain saying I should consider getting back to school, mostly for 3 reasons:<p><pre><code>    There might be a time in the future when I will hit glass ceiling and (CS) degree will be a hard requirement in order to advance my career further. Then it is better to do it now, while I am still relatively young without mortgage and children.\n\n    I enjoy reading books and articles about programming and self-improve in my spare time and I am interested in some theoretical CS concepts I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to, while I was studying for the first time.\n\n    University is great for getting new friends and general networking. I did a poor job in this area during my first run as I was the typical socially awkward, self-conscious kid. I believe I grew a lot as a person during the last 2-3 years and would have much easier time socialising with others this time.\n</code></pre>\nIs there anyone who did something similiar? How did it go? I know it will require dedication and discipline, but I am optimistic as my current job is very flexible and I can do it properly with just 3-4 hours of work (from home) every day. Also, the uni I would go to is decent, but it isn&#x27;t MIT or anything, so it shouldn&#x27;t be super stressful.<p>PS: I am located in Europe, so altough I would have to pay some fees for the second attempt at getting a degree, it is nowhere near what USA universities require and I won&#x27;t have to take any loans for it or anything. It&#x27;s like 60% of my one month salary per semester.",
