      "text": "Hi Everyone, \nI am not here to start a debate about OOPS vs Functional programming. So if you are not doing functional programming and don&#x27;t like it simply ignore this thread.<p>This thread is for everyone who uses functional programming in their day to day life and have gone through the struggle of building mental models about functional way of doing things.<p>I am not looking for a guide to learn haskell syntax and any other programming syntax. I am looking for how to really learn functional programming how to build the mental models in order to think functionally. So that even if a language is not functional by nature, I can model my functions and data in functional way of building programs.<p>I myself write JS and Typescript for living and i came across this library https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gcanti&#x2F;fp-ts<p>But not even 1% of this library make sense to me. So if anyone of you have gone through the struggle and overcome it and using fp in your code. Please share the knowledge to fellow learner.<p>Thanks &lt;3 !!",
