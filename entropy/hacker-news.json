      "text": "I&#x27;d like to create a GUI utility to work with ID3 tags on mp3 files. I was looking for options and found out that programming for Windows is a daunting experience.<p>I can recall starting programming using Visual Basic a long, long time ago. By then I found it very easy to start with because of the drag-&amp;-drop nature of the GUI, out-of-the-box events, etc.<p>What are some modern, free alternatives to Visual Basic that would allow me to easily create a GUI and attach scripts and events to its controls?<p>Please excuse my dated references, I am a web developer unfamiliar with programming for the desktop",

      "text": "I&#x27;m not an expert in USB3 implementation details, but it seems to be a nightmare, even if you can afford to buy the spec. Meanwhile, power-over-ethernet has existed for a while. It seems like all we would need is slightly different connectors to fit into slim devices like phones, and PoE capable cables could fill the data-and-charging roles of USB3, with less weird proprietary nonsense, almost none except for the connector itself, which could conceivably (definitely in my fantasy world) be an open-source design. The software and most of the other hardware pretty much already exists, right? Connecting your phone to your computer is just networking, like plugging in an Ethernet adapter.<p>I&#x27;m sure it can&#x27;t actually be as simple as just CADing up some new connectors, but is there a reason besides inertia this couldn&#x27;t be done and be effective? Say, by a startup willing to abandon a bit of precedent to get a less-proprietary connector?",
