      "text": "Computer Science education at the undergraduate level is all over the place even in most renowned universities. The faculty direct a firehose of knowledge at the students, without considering how much then intake and create a sink or swim culture to weed out students, instead of actually trying to teach and make them learn. Even the programming and data structure courses are either instructor&#x27;s favorite language focused instead of teaching principles of both the science and the engineering.<p>There are guides like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teachyourselfcs.com&#x2F; but they are aimed at experienced developers.<p>Almost all guides assume that either you know programming or you will pick it up by looking at the syntax of a popular language and solving a few problems using it.<p>Mathematics is taught systematically at universities, but, I think CS doesn&#x27;t get the same treatment. That&#x27;s why we get so much junk in production systems.<p>If you were asked to design&#x2F;teach a curriculum to CS students that teach both the science and the art (engineering) how would you design it?<p>Ordering of topics, books used, anything that comes to your mind. Shoot!",
