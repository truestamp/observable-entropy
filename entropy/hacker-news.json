But I have only a basic understanding of how the stock market and trading exchanges work. I&#x27;m wondering what books&#x2F;resources I can read in order to have a thorough enough understanding to be able to create a custom one. I&#x27;m a mid-level software developer so I&#x27;m confident about my ability to be able to build this system once I know the scope. Thanks in advance",
