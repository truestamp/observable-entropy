      "text": "In a last couple of months, I see more and more information about Web 3.0. Mostly high-level discussions about the concept and decentralization. Although I initially attributed it to the hype, I have a stronger feeling today that it becomes an important and serious matter.<p>However, the resources are scarce and I want to understand what is the state of Web 3.0 as of now, early 2022? Is there any work, beyond the high-level concepts? Are there active projects in the domain (by startups or important investments from tech giants)? Research (institutional or not)?<p>Being a software developer, how is Web 3.0 being materialized in a sense of software engineering? Being interested in blockchain (not cryptocurrency), what are the things to look for today to stay up to date?",

I was shocked that after contacting airbnb, there is no recourse for us. They wouldn&#x27;t allow us to cancel or even change our reservation. We reached out to the host and he didn&#x27;t seem to care we had covid either. What&#x27;s shocking about this is we would be potentially taking a disease into a home. I always associated the airbnb brand with trust and safety. I no longer feel this way after this experience.",
