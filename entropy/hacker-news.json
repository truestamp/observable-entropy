Then in 10 years we can look back on it and see how close or far we were from reality.",

Can we please get an option to import and export device information (resolution, dpr, useragent, etc. - maybe even some nice device frames) for the Devices list in Devtools? I&#x27;m really curious about the logic behind deault choice of devices in the list: why are there no Pixel 6&#x2F;6Pro (c&#x27;mon Google, promote your own devices, maybe!?), iPhone 13&#x2F;Pro&#x2F;Max (aka: latest devices, not ancient models)? And, what about &quot;Show device frame&quot;? Seems to only be available for some very old models (or Nesthubs - who needs to see that?). Sheesh.",
