      "text": "I was interviewed for a senior position and one of the interviewers was smirking all the time, although nothing funny was being sad. The other interviewer had a blank&#x2F;sad face, not much facial expression.<p>As the last question, the smirking interviewer asked me if I considered myself junior or senior. I thought that was an odd question and I admitted I didn&#x27;t know everything in the world but I&#x27;d still rank myself senior.<p>I don&#x27;t know, it left a bad taste in my mouth. I&#x27;m not used to interviewing people so my first thoughts were 1) they didn&#x27;t like me and 2) they thought I was wasting their time.<p>I have other interviews this week and I&#x27;m trying to not let this experience get into my head. Any advice is welcome.",
