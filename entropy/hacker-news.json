      "text": "I’d like to aggregate best practices and experiences to scale engineering teams.<p>We’re working with engineering teams from 5 to 100 developers today and found out that almost every engineering managers face the same challenges:<p>- engineers’ well-being &amp; retention,\n- scaling new hires,\n- maintaining engineering velocity,\n- improving collaboration in a remote environment.<p>What is your best advice or piece of experience you’ve used to scale your engineering team? Do you follow specific metrics (DORA metrics, …) or framework (SPACE, …)? I’m particularly interested in helping engineers that start management positions without much experience.<p>Main takeaways we’ve seen so far:\n- following key metrics to assess engineering sprints&#x27; health,\n- regularly sending anonymous surveys to engineers for feedback,\n- creating dedicated timeslots for engineering managers to work on non-direct tech topics (hiring, management, …)",

Current process is manual - just remember the programs I need&#x2F;use&#x2F;want then download and install one by one. It&#x27;s tedious as you can imagine.<p>Are there any projects out there that ease this process? Ninite is pretty slick but the list of software is slim. Trying to find a better way to automate this task and looking to this group to crowdsource answers.<p>Thanks!",
