      "text": "I am a software engineer with more than 15+ years of \nexperience. While most engineers at my age tends to progress \ntowards managerial positions, it is not for me, and I still \nwant to be an engineer.<p>I have been trying to find a new job since the pandemic, \nhowever, the problem is some engineering manager and employers \nonly glance at my yearly contributions of my GitHub profile, \nignoring my contributions in the past and software projects \n(though not actively maintained but they are an important \ndetails about me.). Besides, I have other important things to \ndo, as I am a family man.<p>That green tile is always on the discussion with the EMs, \nasking me questions on why &quot;I don&#x27;t have enough Github \ncontributions&quot;, and &quot;they feel that I am not the right \ncandidate&quot; for the position. It is like a weapon they use, that \nworks against me all the time.<p>I filled that green tiles before when I worked on my previous \nemployers on their private repositories, however, it only lasts \nwhile I am employed at the company. That green tile will reset \nback to blank if they remove me from the company (removing my \naccess from the repositories).<p>I would be very happy if you could make it appear optional, as \nit will bring justice to my engineering experience vs. what&#x27;s \non that green tile.<p>I hope you hear me Github.<p>Thank you.",
