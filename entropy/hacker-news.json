      "text": "You&#x27;ve probably noticed a wave of high-profile layoffs including tech companies (if you haven&#x27;t, take a look at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3MSrKTc).<p>If your company were to announce layoffs today and you were one of the people affected, do you have an agreed severance package that&#x27;ll kick in? Would you want one? Or is it (severance) something you&#x27;re not bothered too much about (e.g. &#x27;cause you&#x27;re well and maybe have quite a bit in savings)?<p>---\n<i>Background: My startup (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;severance.co) is working on a financial product that lets companies provide a severance package for every single employee WHILE also saving them money on unemployment insurance payments, and some of the things we&#x27;re wondering are how commonplace severance is with tech roles and whether high-earning tech workers care enough to negotiate severance.</i>",
