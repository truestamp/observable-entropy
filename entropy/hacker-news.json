      "text": "After having sold my small business and having landed a well paying job, I find myself with some money to start saving for the first time in my adult life.<p>I&#x27;m in my late 20s, in a long term relationship, no kids, no money I can count on from my parents, and have ~70K sitting idle in my bank account. My goal is to preserve it, defend against inflation, and in general being responsible with it.<p>I could open a savings account and let the bank take care of it, but it looks to me that managing savings is not rocket science: ETF &#x2F; index fund should do the trick. And I could save in fees. Also, I&#x27;d like to learn.<p>Am I right? How can I learn how to manage my finances? What tools to use, what simple strategies to pursue, and whatnot. Tried to Google it &#x2F; find YT videos but it&#x27;s all a huge content marketing mess. Everyone pitching &quot;how to retire early&quot; or &quot;how to make money in the stock market&quot;. I&#x27;m not interested: I just want to be proactive and prepared with my personal finances, so that in 10 years from now I can buy a house (not interested in taking a mortgage now: I value flexibility more) and take care of my potential future family.<p>Would love to hear your strategies and your advice on how I can learn.",
