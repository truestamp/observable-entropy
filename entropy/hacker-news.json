However, multiplayer mode is not mentioned.<p>When I started the thread about multiplayer mode not working, and later suggested an alternate product, my response never gets approved to be posted. This has happened twice. And there&#x27;s still no response from Parallels on actually fixing multiplayer. Or making a note that MP does not work on their blog.<p>Instead, they just don&#x27;t approve comments that link to other software vendors. Or, I guess the &quot;I let my Parallels subscription lapse&quot; was too tongue in cheek. This is dirty behavior either way.",

So no way I can be charged any further.<p>Or so I thought.<p>I ping their Customer Service immediately for clarification. They admitted that it should not happened and will ask the accounts team to follow up. No refunds because it has passed 30 days since it was charged (WTF).<p>Ok fine whatever. My main concern is that I hoped this will not happen again.<p>I asked to cancel my subscription but the CS recommend me to just cancel my entire account (lose access to my invoices and conversation details) or just stick with the manual-renewal flow so that it will auto-cancelled next year.<p>The same faulty manual renewal flow that charged me for two years.<p>I was flabbergasted by this suggestion.<p>I insisted on cancelling the subscription and the CS has since stopped responding to me.<p>So if you were using the plugin and thought that you had already done your due diligence in &quot;cancelling&quot; the subscription, it&#x27;s best that you check your bank statement again.",
