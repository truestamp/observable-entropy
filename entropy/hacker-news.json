      "text": "Hello there. I am a high school senior and am interested in computer programming and linux system administration.<p>Sometimes I like to check the internship section on hiring positions available in the monthly _Who&#x27;s hiring_ post.<p>But every internship has certain specifications which usually include (at least) 4th semester of an undergraduate degree, etc. As you may imagine, I am yet to be in that position. I will be starting a CS Engineer Degree in the Fall of 2022, but I would be quite interested in gaining some experience from any Computer Science real workplace worlds.<p>I am looking for suggestions on how to start looking for these kinds of internships, from what I&#x27;ve been looking online I haven&#x27;t really found anything relevant. I&#x27;d be open for any positions (physically) near Mexico City and&#x2F;or virtually with international companies or even US! (I am a US citizen if that matters).<p>I am not (currently) living in the United States. I was raised and born there for four years but all my education has been in Mexico, near Mexico City.<p>If you&#x27;d like some tldr&#x27;d CV it&#x27;s:<p>- Highschool PrepaTec Toluca - Tec de Monterrey. 2019-2022<p>- Local Robotics Highschool team. Known as TECBOT [0]. I currently lead the teaching of rookies for the programming area and have been on the team since 2019 (since the end of middle school).<p><pre><code>  - tecbot github: [4]\n</code></pre>\n- Github: [1] trevcan.<p>- Self-hosted server website: [2]<p><pre><code>  - I have a blog @ `&#x2F;blog`, and a \n\n  - git server @ [3]\n</code></pre>\n- I&#x27;ll be starting a CS engineering degree in the fall of 2022 at Tec de Monterrey Campus Toluca (a.k.a.
