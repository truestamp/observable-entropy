Coming back into FF I noticed a lot of bugs that I wasn&#x27;t aware of before.<p>Often pages dont load CSS &#x2F; js correctly, I have to Ctrl + Shift + R<p>Often Autofill doesn&#x27;t work, it saves passwords under &quot;No user&quot; or not at all<p>Crashes at least once every 48 hours.<p>Is it just me? If not, any good alternatives more privacy friendly than Chrome?",
