      "text": "Using navigator in iOS has been a struggle for everyone for a while.\nStarting from issues that disallowed continuous phone calls with BT on while driving and made BT connections drop after few minutes, making drivers mess with the phone - was resolved long time ago.\nAnd going through the major pain of new iPhone 13, which has best in class camera but has put Apple&#x27;s attentions directed towards drivers&#x27; security, being held captive under a magnifying glass.<p>Many users has been complaining about the issues of making and receiving phone calls with Siri while driving and using navigator on cars that don&#x27;t have support for CarPlay, but rather for older Bluetooth connected builtin screen systems.<p>The issue was that even after un-aknowlegdly making a phone call with voice command while driving in a car, IPhone has been requesting for you to swipe up with your hands from the home screen, look at the screen for face attention that checks your eyes to take action or type in your password after enough amount of failed attempts of FaceID to give up and prompt for pass code - and if not enough, then eventually click the button &quot;I&#x27;m not the driver&quot; just to get access to running navigator on the high way and turn in the right exit.<p>Thank you Apple.<p>Indeed solving the pass code and FaceID is possible by setting up pass code to be prompted after 4 hours, say, to let you drive and if the phone was locked to not to be asked for pass code again.<p>But the driving mode won&#x27;t allow you to set driving focus in any other focus outside of driving focus because setting up focus automatically by connecting to car Bluetooth is possible only from the Driving Focus.<p>Meaning that you will need to swipe up from you phone home screen and click &quot;I&#x27;m not the driver&quot; while driving if the phone has been accidentally locked.<p>Solving it is possible, I&#x27;m not sure though from which version, by setting an Automation for Focus.<p>To eliminate the need to click the &quot;I&#x27;m not driving&quot; button while driving to access Waze or Apple Maps, download the app Shortcuts (similar to Automator on MacOS and OS X).<p>Once installed, setup a &quot;Shortcut&quot; while &quot;Enabling Focus&quot; for the Focus &quot;Driving&quot;. Make the action be &quot;Enable (another) Focus&quot; and be it a new one - the one you want.<p>That&#x27;s it, now you won&#x27;t be bothered anymore by &quot;I&#x27;m not driving&quot; or any other interaction that requires attention to the phone while driving. You&#x27;ll be able to operate now Waze and Apple Maps 100% by your voice.<p>I tried it and it works.<p>Yours,\nvitali.pom",
