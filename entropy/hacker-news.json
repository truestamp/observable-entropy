      "text": "It feels infuriating to think AI and machine learning are becoming the future way of the road. That instead of sound logic, cars will learn important behaviors exhaustively in the name of safety.<p>How about instead of 1000 cars on the road guessing and sharing “neural information” we have all manufacturers agree to make future cars equipped with a standard communication signaling system. One that describes turning, speed, dimensions, all necessities for safety. Then older cars can be the AI fallback.",

I am thinking of using Brave instead of Chrome. Brave <i>is</i> faster. But I live in my browser and it&#x27;s a big move. I use Windows, iOS and Linux - home, work and school - so I would be all in if I switched.",
