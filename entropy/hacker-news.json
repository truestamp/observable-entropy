      "text": " I have been writing software professionally for almost 3 years now at a small company. However, code quality and software testing are just not part of the culture in my workplace. I want to advance in my career and feel that I lack so much when it comes to writing tests. I am familiar with the idea and have done a few &quot;calculator testing&quot; examples in python. However, when a projects involve databases and various other components, I don&#x27;t know where to start. I would like to ask for any resources that help develop software testing skills for experienced programmers.",
