      "text": "What is your experience with one or the other approach of therapy? Thoughts, observations, information, anecdotes?<p>---<p>In Germany, therapists are differentiated between &#x27;depth psychotherapy&#x27; and &#x27;behavior therapy&#x27; (there are more, but those are the most common ones). I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a distinction made everywhere in the world, but here you go. If you wonder what the difference is - in my own words and simple terms:<p>depth psychotherapy: more of an analytical approach to find the underlying root cause and take care of it (bottom to top)<p>behavior therapy: improve your life by fighting the symptoms and let your restored mental health sink in and resolve the cause (top to bottom)<p>---<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not asking about the &#x27;better&#x27; way of doing therapy. The best way is the one that works for YOU. The decision about one of those approaches might not even be the critical point to make therapy work for you. Stay safe!",
