Is this because the metrics driving these sites are primarily user acquisition? Is this some UX trend I missed? I would say that it could be that designers don&#x27;t expect people to ever log out, but many of these sites won&#x27;t keep you logged in anyway, so you need to sign in every time you use them.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on an Open Source project[0] recently, and I&#x27;ve been wondering about the best way to actually talk with developers.<p>I&#x27;m a dev. I don&#x27;t really like to talk to people unless I have to. Getting me on the phone for 15 minutes with a stranger... is unlikely. Even with a $20 gift card incentive. I presume most other devs are the same.<p>So, what&#x27;s the best way to talk with devs and gather meaningful feedback to be able to improve the project? I want to know answers to questions like, &quot;Would you use this? If not, why not?&quot; or &quot;After reading the docs, can you explain back to me what the project does for you?&quot;<p>Maybe HN isn&#x27;t the place to ask this. Maybe this is too business focused. But, I figured I&#x27;d ask anyway. What ideas do you have for how an Open Source project could gather feedback from you? It&#x27;s a very good way to &quot;give back&quot; to Open Source, so maybe that&#x27;s the best angle to take?<p>Thanks!<p>0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lunasec-io&#x2F;lunasec",
