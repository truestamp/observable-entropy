      "text": "We created a marketplace called bringshopper.com where we bring shoppers to newly started businesses. We had a call with their sales team and as they suggested we used Stripe Standard Connect and direct charges. When we bring shoppers successfully we charged higher application fees to cover our costs and there was no upfront costs\nWe even built feature to cover negative balances of connected accounts by cutting their ad budget<p>And one day Stripe blocked our account, and disabled all our connected accounts and said they WILL NOT RELEASE OUR FUNDS AND WILL USE TO REFUND ALL CUSTOMERS. Now there are multiple things: 1) They didn&#x27;t refund anyone as we are a platform account we have no charges under us to refund 2) They didn&#x27;t release funds either<p>They TOOK OUR FUNDS, $159k to be exact They can&#x27;t refund customers of all connected accounts and use our funds as they advertise in stripe.com&#x2F;connect&#x2F;pricing that Stripe Standard Connect is not responsible for losses, disputes, refunds of connected accounts<p>There is no charges to be refunded or disputed and they simply took our funds<p>How is this even legal? Anyone had similar experience or anyone can help? Our company is struggling here due to this<p>Our account id is acct_1K7t9JC4s1I9dR5f<p>Updates:\nEdwin reached out in other thread I shared saying they can&#x27;t support our business but still didn&#x27;t say anything about release of our funds<p>I want to know when will we receive our money",
