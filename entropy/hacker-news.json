      "text": "Hey! I&#x27;ve had an idea floating around in my head for a while and I recently decided to see if I could quickly put something together, mostly just because I felt it could possibly help with my fun personal combo of ADHD and anxiety.<p>I&#x27;ve been calling it &quot;Programmable Thoughts&quot; and the core concept is essentially &quot;Thought to Inbox&quot;, relying on the ability to quickly offload thoughts so you can process them later in a place where you already spend time (your inbox). I realize it&#x27;s not a particularly novel idea (just found out about Braintoss) but the way it&#x27;s built provides near infinite customization on the backend. The frontend is an incredibly simple Android&#x2F;iOS voice recording app that allows you to tag recordings with user-defined strings, and then synchronizes with Google Drive. The backend is where things get interesting, as it&#x27;s built on a Google Apps Script framework and uses Google&#x27;s Cloud Speech-to-Text API. While I did already publish to the app stores, I really could use some folks to help test the app and the backend script, as well as feedback on the entire concept. Anyone who helps test will have their name credited on the GitHub repo if they’d like.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in helping out, just send an email to dustin@programmablethoughts.com and let me know if you&#x27;d like to test the Android or iOS app (or both) and I&#x27;ll send you an internal test build invite.<p>Check out the GitHub repo for more info - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MomentCaptureInc&#x2F;ProgrammableThoughts<p>Thanks in advance.<p>-Dustin",
