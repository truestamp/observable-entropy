The group&#x27;s insignia features the Wolfsangel and the Black Sun, two neo-Nazi symbols.</i><p>&gt; <i>Azov soldiers have been observed wearing Nazi-associated symbols on their uniforms.In 2014, the German ZDF television network showed images of Azov fighters wearing helmets with swastika symbols and &quot;the SS runes of Hitler&#x27;s infamous black-uniformed elite corps&quot;. In 2015, Marcin Ogdowski, a Polish war correspondent, gained access to one of Azov&#x27;s bases located in the former holiday resort Majak; Azov fighters showed to him Nazi tattoos as well as Nazi emblems on their uniforms.</i><p>Given that Amazon removes products with Nazi symbolism from their platform[2], selling merchandise that celebrates Nazi imagery in this context seems like a violation of their policy, too.<p>I&#x27;m posting this here because I&#x27;ve had no luck with contacting Amazon about their sellers in the past, even when they&#x27;re running blatant scams.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Azov_Battalion<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;amazon-removes-products-featuring-nazi-symbols.html",
