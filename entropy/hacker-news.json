      "text": "I am the founding team member of a small startup. I was thinking about using Linear as our project management tool. The UI&#x2F;UX is amazing and I&#x27;ve heard great things about it which makes me want to try it out even more.\nThe problem is, since we are a very early stage startup, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be able to afford Linear for maybe the next 3 months or so ( India based so the USD to INR conversion makes it worse ). I can see linear has a very generous plan but the things I am worried about is the 250 issue limit, and the 150 MB file upload limit. \nIs anyone using Linear Free tier one and have you faced any crucial issues with using it?",

      "text": "I am planning to buy a wasteland measuring 5-10 acres in India without a lot of water. I plan to save water using rainwater harvesting and hoping that I run into some groundwater. This land has no irrigation facility.<p>What would be the most efficient use of something like this ? I am planning to start a small library&#x2F; school for impoverished tribals but I was wondering if there is any way a land like this can be made self sustaining using new technological or other solutions that I may not be aware of.<p>I always ask myself questions like:<p>What is the best way to convert sunlight &amp; water to biomass ?<p>How to utilize solar energy locally ?<p>How much water can I reuse ?<p>The idea is to show that something sustainable can be done with right approach and hopefully support at least 4-5 poor people and more others (via education).",
