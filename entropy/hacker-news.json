What tools are you using to make sure that access is removed &#x2F; granted when needed?<p>Is Okta inevitable or is there a nice solution based on Google Workspace that saves us?<p>I&#x27;d love to hear how you are all tackling this issue in startup teams (10 - 50 people) and what has worked and what hasn&#x27;t!",
