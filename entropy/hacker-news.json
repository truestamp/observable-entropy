Launched small and trying to keep up.<p>I come from a B2B software world and so my mindset is programmed differently. Im looking for a mentor that can answer a few questions over email once a week. Probably would take you 15min. Questions will vary. From business, marketing, customer support to maybe more production related stuff.<p>Im looking for someone who has been there and built a successful B2C hardware business to 7-8 figures of revenue at least.<p>Would love to chat and feel free to let me know what a fair compensation would be.",
