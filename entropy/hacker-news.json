      "text": "Code reviews have become a pretty standard part of how dev teams operate. But I&#x27;ve talked to a bunch of developers about this recently, and it seems like everyone wishes the process was different&#x2F;better. For some it&#x27;s an emotional thing - no one likes to get critiqued. For others it&#x27;s a procedural thing - their company doesn&#x27;t have clearly defined procedures in place for doing code reviews. \nSo I&#x27;m turning to the HN community for some expert feedback. \nWhat do you hate most about code reviews? What would do do differently do make it better&#x2F;more effective?<p>Thanks!!",
