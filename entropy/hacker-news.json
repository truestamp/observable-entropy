For example in Android, it&#x27;s basically impossible to set a countdown timer if the phone is locked without using a voice assistant. Apple might have implemented this specific feature better by allowing users to access the timer through the Control Center. However, iOS&#x27;s calculator is just too cumbersome to use due its lack of features and lack of decent alternatives. What are your thoughts?<p>Edit: typo",
