      "text": "I share a Spotify account.<p>When the other person is using the account to listen, one of my go-to tricks is to enter a dummy IP address (usually 127.0.0.1 with a random port) to fake &quot;airplane mode&quot; - Spotify can&#x27;t connect to the internet and detect the other&#x27;s usage, and I can listen to downloaded playlists. Win-win.<p>But! Recently I noticed that filling out a dummy proxy IP will simply cause Spotify to show a &quot;Something went wrong&quot; modal, with an unhelpful &quot;Try reloading this page&quot; and &quot;reload page&quot; button, while disabling any access to other pages (including &quot;Settings&quot; page), so I can&#x27;t revert the proxy settings. Only thing to do is to completely uninstall and reinstall.<p>Just thought I&#x27;d share. Cheers!",

There&#x27;s a photo of him floating around at space camp, absolutely beaming, that really hit me. It made me realize just how much he was one of us - the type who goes onto become an engineer, a hacker, a futurist, an entrepreneur.<p>So, unlike before, I&#x27;ll have a drink to honor his passing, and I hope you will too.",
