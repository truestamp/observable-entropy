      "text": "Hi HN!<p>I know that companies use services like Lever, Greenhouse and other to manage candidates where you see their resumes, notes and feedback from other engineers&#x2F;colleagues who are in the hiring loop, schedule etc. \nAs a candidate, I feel all this is all over the place from my side. I apply for jobs and then I forget where did I apply and what was the job post (i eventually can hunt it down but it&#x27;s kinda painful). I want to be able to keep track of what questions i asked and answers I got, schedule, interview process, assignments, and other notes in a concise way. Is there a system&#x2F;method or a service that you worked for?",
