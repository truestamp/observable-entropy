      "text": "Hey, folks! I&#x27;m hoping to gather some career advice from software engineers.<p>I&#x27;m a web developer in my early 30s. I&#x27;m seeing my job slowly become replaced by no-code tools. I&#x27;m quite certain my job won&#x27;t exist anymore in 10 years. Plus, the job is terribly boring.<p>My goal is to transition into software engineering.<p>I&#x27;m in the process of joining a program to earn a post-bacc in CS. I would be done in two years. What worries me is that I&#x27;ll be entering an entirely new field a decade later than typical.<p>My only goal is to increase my earning potential (I&#x27;d like my next starting salary to be above 200,000 USD) and work on interesting problems.<p>What can I do to compensate for my late start and stand out more to FAANG employers?  How can I compete with new grads with Ivy League CS degrees? (I did go to a nationally ranked school for my BA, but my degree was in literature)",
