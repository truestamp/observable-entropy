      "text": "So It&#x27;s not ready yet, but I&#x27;m creating a new job board for developers. I&#x27;m looking to get feedback on idea itself....<p>So my hypothesis is that as a dev, I&#x27;d love to do some gigs on the side. But I&#x27;m not really in the mood to search for them, apply to 1000s of them and do all back and forth.<p>I literally want small jobs, that I can knock out in a day or two, and get paid $100-$1k.<p>Another extension to this idea I&#x27;ve thought about is, to have an expert dev on call.<p>Got stuck in your day to day work? Call in expert. The expert does screen share, fixes the problem hopefully. But it could be like a service that companies could subscribe for monthly N hours. (SQL expert, Wordpress, React, etc)<p>Which one do you think has more potential?",
