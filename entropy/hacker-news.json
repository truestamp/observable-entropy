We are trying to hire Software engineers and are using Leetcode type problems as a selection mechanism.<p>The problem with it, is if a candidate is very good at it she will be getting an offer from some of the larger companies who follow a similar process and there is no way we can compete with them on salary.<p>Additionally, internal Google research has also found poor correlation between such tests and performance at the job.<p>So question for HR and hiring managers from smaller companies - what alternative approaches do you use to interview employees?<p>One option is take home tests.   I have taken them while job hunting and wasted numerous hours only to get &#x27;we will not be proceeding&#x27; emails or even ghosted.  Too many hours wasted.<p>Any good alternatives?<p>Thanks.",
