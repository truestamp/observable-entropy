      "text": "I have a slight dilemma, I am a CS graduate with no experience in real software development jobs. I can&#x27;t get a job for two main reasons:<p>1) There are NO local jobs (I live in a shitty developing country).  \n2) Can&#x27;t relocate to a different country due to financial issues. Aka, I don&#x27;t have that much money.<p>What I am trying to do is get internships or preferably a remote junior position with only my CS degree.<p>Is this possible? Could you guide me?",
