      "text": "I&#x27;m curious who here knows the power of &#x27;necessary.&#x27; Here&#x27;s what I mean: if I asked what&#x27;s necessary for fire, you&#x27;d say some variation of &quot;oxygen, fuel, and enough heat.&quot; [1] But hidden is awesome potential for out of the box thinking.<p>For instance:<p>Say I&#x27;m camping in the woods, and I want to start a fire. Knowing what&#x27;s necessary, I look around me: my clothes can be fuel, and my glasses can concentrate the sun&#x27;s heat. [2]<p>Do you see what I mean? When I want something to happen, I supply what&#x27;s necessary. This lets me try new things and quickly learn why they work (or don&#x27;t.) It&#x27;s the fastest feedback loop I know.<p>Now say it&#x27;s 1833. Humanity&#x27;s tools for artificial light are candles, gas lamps, and fireplaces. They&#x27;re expensive, inconsistent, and a fire risk. But if I play with what&#x27;s necessary, I may notice that fire isn&#x27;t needed for artificial light, so I place some fuel and heat in a vacuum.[3]<p>So: When I want something to stop, I suppress a necessary condition. That&#x27;s a straight way to invent the electric light-bulb (based on nothing nobody&#x27;s seen) and change civilization forever!<p>I hope it&#x27;s clear that needs and causation are almost the same. Necessary is just a way to explain every solution that has worked or is yet to be invented for making or preventing what happens. Thus, it may be useful for learning to code.<p>So I entreat you, fellow hackers: what are things that happen to coders? I know bugs happen, so bugs have necessary conditions. We could invent a new way to debug. But I bet more things happen in computer science. What, though?<p>See you in the comments.<p>*Notes*<p>[1]: My version is oxidizer, enough fuel for a chain reaction, and heat at the fuel&#x27;s flash point.<p>[2]: Oxygen will be in the air, of course.<p>[3]: The first practical light-bulb was electric current (heat), passing through a carbonized bamboo string (fuel), inside a vacuum tube.",
