I&#x27;ve had several deals with this syndicate that has been stuck in closing for over 6 months.<p>Sundeep is just refusing to respond despite requests from myself and his own syndicate partners. He&#x27;s still sending out deal invites, so it is apparent that he is just ignoring us.<p>I have a small amount invested ($7,000), but I have to imagine that there are others out there with funds committed to deals that have yet to close. My next course of action is to file an SEC complaint, so wanted to see who else  might be affected.",
