      "text": "(taking into consideration all the personal factors like where your friends, family, work experiences are)<p>Within a given country, cities can be vastly different in terms of factors that have a significant impact on one&#x27;s life including: economic opportunity, cost of living, social opportunity, weather, types of activities people do, healthy living, culture etc.<p>Unfortunately, even if one may greatly prefer living in a different city, many people are tied down due to their friends&#x2F;family&#x2F;job and never seriously consider the option of moving elsewhere.<p>Sometimes this is sound. Friends and family matter a lot so even if you would prefer living in the mountains and have the ability to go hiking - it may be the case you are better off in a city without accessible hiking but being near your dearest friends and family.<p>Other times, its less sound. Sure, friends and family are nice - but in light of how many years you may spend in the superior city, and how much of an improvement it can be on a number of dimensions, it may be worth the loss of family&#x2F;friends for the greener pastures.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear how people in this community think about this question. How seriously do you think people should investigate and analyze if they are living in the &quot;right&quot; city? How much of a difference does being in the &quot;right&quot; city actually make? What steps and experiments can one explore to try and identify what may be the &quot;right&quot; city for them?",

Only easy todos like &quot;walk with a dog&quot; or &quot;read a book&quot;. I like taskwarrior and dstask as proof of concept, but come on, to add a task with needed tags and parent I need to write literally five times as much as task is. I don&#x27;t have such a good memory to remember all the tags and flags that are out there. I like Org-Mode, but I&#x27;m Vim user (un)fortunately.<p>So please, post here task&#x2F;project&#x2F;todo management software that you found really nice and useful. That have tags, maybe trees, maybe something else. CLI, TUI or GUI.",
