What ensued was someone uncommitted coming onboard and I made a bad hire I had to fire later. I decided its best to leverage the connections you build but I am at square one having focused heavily on side projects the past few years but just started college. Any advice on gettong really solid relationships set up and potentially down the line enabling us to work on something or trying to bring them onboard in a year or two?",
