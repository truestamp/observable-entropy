      "text": "If you&#x27;ve ever been dropped on a new or large Maven project or had to explain your Maven build to a new hire, you know how verbose and tricky to read the POM XMLs are. This plugin aims to simplify that by creating a simple visualization of the Maven build lifecycle that you can click through. It orders the execution of the various plugins, creates a simple website visualization, and creates an embeddable markdown visualization using Mermaid-Js.",
