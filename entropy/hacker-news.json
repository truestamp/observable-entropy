      "text": "Hello, i am a part time&#x2F;student worker as Frontend Developer. Apple products are my personal devices and habe a windows laptop from the company i work for.<p>I saw obviously material design on my sites. But for the first time a task given me to remove Bootstrat from a project and use Vuetify (Matrial Design flavored) instead.<p>My experience is more than awful. Who think that the bounce effect on click can be a good thing? Why button texts have to be uppercase? Is the border at bottom really means something?<p>I can’t really engage with this design system and i can’t really understand why is this thing so popular. Am i alone?",
