      "text": "Hello everyone,<p>When I am not working, I like to play the carpenter... Yesterday I finished building my first folding table, with a custom design I was so proud of. Unfortunately, once I was done I realized that the table is very wobbly. It looks like something generates a lot of torque on the legs (made of wood). I tried to make them stronger by adding some steel plates, but it didn&#x27;t work.<p>Before attempting more fixes, I&#x27;d like to simulate via software what would happen (for example: replacing wooden legs with steel legs). But I don&#x27;t know of any 3D physics engine that would allow me to do this kind of simulations.<p>Do you know something that might help me?",
