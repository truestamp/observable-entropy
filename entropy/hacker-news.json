      "text": "Russia has invaded Ukraine, and four days on I feel powerless to both do anything (in a country that is neither of those two!) and to look away from the news and social media coverage of it. It&#x27;s an abhorrent waste of human life.<p>News and reports today of Russian ICBMs and other nuclear forces being placed on high alert (and moved further towards the west of the country) [1] frankly scares me. While some observers think that this is &quot;overplaying&quot; his hand [2] I know that all of this is deeply concerning. The world does _not_ need another cuban missile crisis; it also does _not_ need to vanish in a pile of radioactive smoke.<p>I live in Europe. My father sent me a message to essentially ask if I&#x27;d had a thought about where my nearest &quot;shelter&quot; would be -- and I had. My partner&#x27;s family have too. It feels awful, but I can&#x27;t concentrate effectively -- I&#x27;m glued to the news and I need to put it down, convince myself that the world won&#x27;t end tomorrow, and get back to work.<p>Am I the only person affected similarly by events? How else have you been coping with it all?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2022&#x2F;feb&#x2F;27&#x2F;vladimir-putin-puts-russia-nuclear-deterrence-forces-on-high-alert-ukraine<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.veteranstoday.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;is-putin-overplaying-his-hand-by-moving-icbms-into-western-russia&#x2F;",
