      "text": "Hello;<p>This is one of those &quot;solve my own problem&quot; situations. I have always struggled with interviewing, which is kind of ironic since I&#x27;ve conducted at least 100 interviews, though none in tech.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in a world where, 10, 20, or even 50, interviews later, you keep getting the standard &quot;after careful consideration, we decided you weren&#x27;t a good fit.&quot; After the number gets so large, you end up having to explain why you&#x27;ve been out of work for 6 to 12 months... or longer.<p>You mull over the interview, and you come up with no reason that you didn&#x27;t get offered a take home test. I discovered early on that there is no one who will give any feedback due to legal reasons.<p>The concept would be simple: For $100, you do a 30 to 60 minute interview with a technical person who has done interviews before. Within 24 hours, you get a write up on what you did right, what you did wrong, and what you can improve on. The interviewer would get paid $75 for his or her time.<p>Is a service like this viable? It&#x27;s a definite chicken &#x2F; egg project.",
