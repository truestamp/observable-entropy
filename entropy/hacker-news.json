      "text": "What do you do in the following case:<p>- You have have gained some insights about a specific domain, to solve some challenges in this domain\n- You want to setup an organisation to solve this problem \n- The insights are completely paradigm shifting\n- The vision of what this organisation could be, and the change it could initiate drives fear in you\n- You are afraid of telling people what the idea &amp;  plan (how to) is because you think they will call you crazy!<p>* As an example :<p>We have a hypothetical world, tataoine. On tatoine there are tribes, and all tribes resolve conflict between each other by fighting. They never do anything else.<p>So an entire industry has popped up in order to build swords\n - 95% of people are building swords in the same way for generations.\n - Some forward thinking folks have come about and said your methods of building swords are not optimal. So they have optimised the method of building\n - Some other folks have come about and said maybe we need new types of swords, so now they are building light sabres<p>NOW: \n- This insight began with some first principals thinking. What should this thing actually be, no other assumptions. How can we actually solve for the right problem (resolving conflict)\n - The realisation is that sword makers are producing swords for a world that no longer requires swords, but everyone still continues because they think its best\n  -  Because there is so much swords produced, organisations spring up to architect &quot;conflict&quot; so that they can leverage the swords\n- This is what keeps the system going\n- Along comes someone and says, hey instead of first resorting to war. Maybe we should just speak to each other first. \n- Completely different paradigm on how to resolve conflict)<p>Insight was gained due to my own struggle with trying to solve this in my own personal life.<p>* This is just an example, the insight has nothing to do with ACTUAL war. Just wanted to throw in the light sabre reference :)",
