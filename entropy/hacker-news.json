      "text": "Hi HN!<p>Any recommendations for getting up to speed quickly on data engineering &#x2F; ETL system design? A course with exercises would be great as would a book&#x2F;blog with example real-world architectures that has some depth to it, discusses tradeoffs.<p>My goal is to maintain and eventually improve a system that just fell in my lap. It&#x27;s using Kinesis&#x2F;Glue&#x2F;Parquet&#x2F;S3&#x2F;Athena to process telemetry data for hourly reports (non-realtime) and ad-hoc querying. All my experience so far is with rdbms-backed web apps.<p>Thanks in advance for any links&#x2F;tips!",
