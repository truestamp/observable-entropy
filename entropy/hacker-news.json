      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m thinking of making a Mac app that will allow users securely save their photos and videos, not just save but encrypt every bit of data saved into this app. Also, I was thinking of adding synchronization, so the users can sync their media across all devices and only can access their files with a password. However, I don&#x27;t know if someone will use some kind of app like this for Mac. I saw a lot of Photo Vault on iPhone but I don&#x27;t know if Mac users are interested in these kinds of apps.<p>Would you use a Mac app to protect your photos and videos in an encrypted vault? I will appreciate it if you can share your opinion if you see this as something you would use.",
