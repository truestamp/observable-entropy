If I don&#x27;t replace a filter after two months or less, I will get allergies (stuffy nose) because of the particles getting re-released back into the air. Has anyone had similar experience and&#x2F;or decisions? I&#x27;ve been following the advice of just adding more ventilation and cleaning the house more often. I honestly find that less annoying.",
