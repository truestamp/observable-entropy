      "text": "I have always had a dream of having a self-built blog where I share what I learn. Not for any ulterior motives but just to share my experiences, as I do not like the ecosystem social media platforms have built.<p>But now, that I am all setup and have written a few articles, I am concerned if I should be spending time writing articles just for fun.\nAll the &quot;blogging as a career&quot; content out there seems to make me feel like aspiring to just blog as a hobby is a pipe-dream.<p>So I want to ask, is anyone out there blogging for fun anymore?",
