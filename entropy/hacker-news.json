      "text": "So if you think about a complicated application like Microsoft Excel, how do people learn that for the first time?<p>If you&#x27;re coming from Microsoft&#x27;s side, and you&#x27;re getting it integrated in some company, would a person go there&#x2F;do some kind of group presentation and present it?<p>We&#x27;re currently doing that, although trying to make the onboarding self-explanatory, make PDFs (how-to guides), videos, things like that.<p>But if you wanted to inform users of known issues, feature updates as they come out... is something like an email weird?<p>I know some apps you get an in-app popup about features, maybe you can get fancy and do the feature highlights... however our app is not a leisure type use. If you use it you&#x27;re directly connecting two people eg. user&#x2F;their customer.<p>So I&#x27;ve been trying to think of ways to make that process more legit. This way people can gradually add on the new features that come out to their existing knowledge of the application itself.",

      "text": "A group of my friends made this platform as part of a course we’re taking that teaches us about open source software development practices, and we would like to announce that we’ve finished its basic functionality.<p>We created this in response to the Rythm bot for Discord being shut down, and intend to have it so that you could use our API to stream files on a remote machine to multiple clients. We provided an example client as a Discord bot.<p>Demonstration video (apologies for the bad quality!): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1BElcWOi4bPMGhvmtrWqdAZ5P-9I80xB4&#x2F;view<p>We’re hoping to grow a community on this, since it’s great to have actual users and contributors (if possible!) We opened a few issues, and think it would be cool to see people eventually start making their own clients if they have preferences for audio streaming other than Discord voice channels!<p>Here’s the organization repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;raudio-project<p>Here’s the landing page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raudio-project.github.io&#x2F;<p>And the Discord server link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;invite&#x2F;FM78JTfU9X<p>Any and all feedback is appreciated! Also, please feel free to join the Discord and have a chat with us!",
