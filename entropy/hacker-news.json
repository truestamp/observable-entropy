      "text": "I was looking through the CNCF tools and certificates, with all the cloud deployment options, and realised the main advocates are Google and Amazon.

By sexy, I mean people like to build things how Google builds things and Resume-driven development means that this can result in higher salaries for the people using these tools.<p>This might be a cynical view, but is the modern approach of software engineering just a giant sales campaign ran by cloud providers to increase their profits?",
