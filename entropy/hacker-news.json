One of the most common pieces of feedback we received was that the pricing was way too complicated.<p>Based on this feedback, we decided to simplify it quite a lot, as well as add a new tier.<p>Here&#x27;s the new pricing: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;v2.envkey.com&#x2F;pricing<p>And here&#x27;s a summary of the changes:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;eec5d70dc70b&#x2F;envkey-v2-is-live-20224903<p>If you saw our Show HN and thought EnvKey was interesting, but were confused or turned off by the pricing page, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts! Questions or feedback on any other aspect of EnvKey are also welcome.",
