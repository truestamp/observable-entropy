      "text": "Hey HN!<p>The metaverse is not one app. It&#x27;s a network of thousands of virtual worlds people visit daily to play games, work, and collaborate. To unlock the full potential of the metaverse, those worlds need to be connected. Today we&#x27;re making a big step towards making that happen.<p>Ready Player Me is an avatar platform used by 260+ companies, including VRChat, Somnium Space, Mozilla Hubs, and others. Today, we are launching our biggest update ever, taking us closer to our vision – create a platform that allows you to keep a consistent identity in virtual worlds and the Metaverse. The Ready Player Me Hub allows you to create one or multiple avatars and use it in all supported applications in a few clicks. We shared more details on our blog.<p>We are very excited about this big step towards making the Metaverse dream real.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;readyplayer.me&#x2F;\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.readyplayer.me&#x2F;3d-avatars-from-photo-metaverse-hub",

It&#x27;s a pretty ingenious workaround.<p>This is way more lucrative than any other scam in the world. A single video can make $300k , or about the same as a large ransomware payout, but without having to worry about the Secret Service, the FBI, or having tainted crypto.<p>YouTube is trying to stop these videos by algorithmically detecting certain characters and other markers indicative of the scam, although the huge profitability of this scam ensures scammers will keep finding ways to innovate and stay a few steps ahead of YouTube.",
