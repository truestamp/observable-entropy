      "text": "Most of the articles about this seem to just summarize now dependent everyone is on Russia. I haven&#x27;t seen much discussion about actual preparations for this possibility.

Biden also included in his announcement of sanctions that they would try to work on increasing oil supply from other nations at least to help Americans somewhat at the pump, but I haven&#x27;t heard much from Europe on how they&#x27;ll deal with potential fallout of natural gas supply from Russia decreasing or shut off completely.<p>With tougher sanctions and everyone sending weapons to Ukraine, this has to be something Putin is considering, shouldn&#x27;t we be trying to mitigate this before people&#x27;s homes go cold?",
