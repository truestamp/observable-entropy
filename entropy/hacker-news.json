What would be analogous in &quot;modern&quot; data pipelines? I think this DMX is from Syncsort from like 2010 or so, I found some YT tutorials from 2012 but that&#x27;s about it.<p>We have a database that&#x27;s being cloned, the clone is helpful to make faster queries and as a protective backup, I suppose? I am still a beginner, would love any resources you may have on this older technology.",
