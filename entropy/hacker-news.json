      "text": "As the title states. I use Tor purely for privacy, so that I can conduct searches (sometimes just for health stuff) without everything being logged in my Permanent Internet Record&#x2F;getting fed into ad networks. I do understand that Tor is not guaranteed to be 100% anonymous.<p>Are there any hacks that tell you if ad networks have connected your &#x27;real&#x27; identity to a Tor session? The only idea I had was going to Youtube and seeing if they suggest the same videos that they do for my normal Chrome sessions, but that appeared to not work. Do you try turning off adblock, say, and seeing if ads suggested on Tor are the same as you see in regular browser? Anything more technical that one can try with the ad networks? Would be curious to see if any of my Tor session has been compromised yet or not",
