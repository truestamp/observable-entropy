But when they talk about a topic you know very well, you realize they aren&#x27;t that smart.<p>And, if this happens to the topics you know a lot about, what about the other topics you don&#x27;t know  much about? Are they wrong about those too?<p>So my question is: is there a name for this &quot;effect&quot;, that you &quot;lose trust&quot; on someone you regarded as knowledgeable when they talked about something you know well?",
