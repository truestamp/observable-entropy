There exist several programs that are similar (see the listing in the README), but none of them do it quite the way I like, and often they have a very complex UI and a ton of features. I tried to make something that is obvious how to use and gets out of your way. (I also wanted an excuse to learn Rust.)<p>Let me know what you think!",

I&#x27;m not keen on moving around for postdoc positions so this seemed like a good option.<p>I am satisfied with the work but I&#x27;m an idealist and my long-term dream is still a faculty position at a university.<p>1. Did I throw a wrench into that by choosing an industry gig over a postdoc? \n2. Are there any (recent) examples of research engineers transitioning into a tenured position? \n3. What should I optimize for in my current position to better my odds of achieving that?<p>(I&#x27;m EU based &amp; working for a US company in case it matters.)",
