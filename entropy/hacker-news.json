      "text": "I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a frontend dev, but I do have experience with ReactJS, Svelte and also server side templating languages like Jinja.<p>I haven&#x27;t done much frontend work in a while and I am wondering what the landscape looks like now. What do people here like working with?<p>This is regarding building highly interactive web apps.<p>---<p>I used ReactJS before the introduction of hooks. I found it quite nice, though I am sure I wrote some terrible code. I found Redux a bit cumbersome to use and very lengthy to write out the whole process, even if you just wanted to update the state of a button.<p>I will reiterate that a lot of my time with React+Redux I was asking myself: &quot;Surely there is a better way to do this, I must be doing this wrong&quot;.<p>Svelte felt... lighter, simpler. But maybe in some ways too simple. I found the lack of a router a bit odd and was a bit confused about the stage of the project, which didn&#x27;t encourage me to keep using it.",
