      "text": "Hi,<p>I recently started an internship in a private research company and I&#x27;m supposed to write an article for a conference in the next 6 months.<p>This is a process that confuses me. How do people look at some data and then come up with some ideas that they find worth publishing?<p>My work involves applying complex science measurements on some environmental data. There are around 40 measurements of complexity that I found so far, with 4 types of entropies. How is one supposed to believe that they have a proper understanding of all of them, have a proper understanding of the existing research and also come up with some novel insights?<p>Some content about the scientific process in general  or about personal experiences would be highly appreciated.",
