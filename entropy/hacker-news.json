      "text": "Hi everyone, I was already talking about it on ItaliaPersonalFinance, I&#x27;m thinking of starting a small business to supplement my income.<p>The idea is to help other people improve or build from scratch their CV, resume (and LinkedIn profile) at a price yet to be determined. I would start with a couple of free consultations and then try to figure out the price at which to offer this service.<p>By now I have quite a bit of experience and also having some colleagues and friends in HR, I know that my work has actually brought some results.<p>Can I kindly hear your opinion?<p>Thank you!",
