      "text": "I have a degree and was a professional full stack .NET for 10 years. I used to think I wasn&#x27;t getting hired because I looked like a job hopper but now they tell me it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t been working as a developer in two years. I am still just as knowledgeable and I don&#x27;t apply to jobs that require me to know the latest tech anyways. So I am applying for things I am qualified for and know how to do.<p>I&#x27;m pretty much on my last limb and really need a job at this point. I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t convince anyone to hire me. Like, I&#x27;ve seen your guys&#x27; code, lol. Like, I can&#x27;t even find work fixing someone&#x27;s junky windows forms app. I can program, really.<p>I am considering doing a personal project. I don&#x27;t know if that will even help because I suspect 9&#x2F;10 hiring managers aren&#x27;t even considering me.<p>I don&#x27;t have any friends or a LinkedIn. I just know how to program. I will do a great job wherever I find work. How do I trick these people into doing their job good and recognizing a good developer?",
