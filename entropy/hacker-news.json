      "text": "I’m currently working as a dev at a non-FAANG (but still big and well known) tech company. The job pays really well, work life balance is great, and it’s overall a very cushy gig. But… I hate it. I don’t like the day to day work and am completely uninterested in the larger company mission.<p>So I started job hunting and got an offer doing dev work at a small nonprofit. It feels like a perfect match, but the pay is going to be much lower (My total comp will drop from 300k to 100k USD), and I’m surprised to find myself getting nervous about the financial consequences.<p>It’s still a six figure job, so I won’t be living in poverty but I’ll clearly need to make some lifestyle adjustments.<p>I’m hoping some other HN users have made a similar transitions and have tips&#x2F;tricks&#x2F;stories about undoing years of lifestyle creep and resetting some of the hedonic adaptation I’ve built up? Is making such a career switch a stupid idea?",
