      "text": "Every time I come across a mention of Telegram here, most of the comments vehemently attack it for bad encryption approach and misleading users.<p>Smoothly running a communication platform for 500 millions MAU with unlimited uploads volume seems to be a huge technical endeavor. I would expect people working in tech to be interested in it and support the ingenuity behind it. I guess many of us would say that it’s a too complicated task to handle. Somebody who actually can do it, like Nikolai (Pavel’s brother) Durov, a multiple winner of international programming competitions, may rightfully consider himself to be smarter&#x2F;more knowledgeable in this area than most other people. There was no major leaks or downtime yet during their rapid growth, so for now his calculations hold true. (This doesn’t assume a proprietary protocol was a right decision).<p>I’m not saying that security flaws should be ignored; I’m just surprised no one tries to get in their shoes and treat the project as a whole.",
