I&#x27;ve really only read novels though, where I&#x27;m just there to have a good time, and I don&#x27;t care if I can remember every detail.<p>When reading technical books I feel like I need to take notes, make Anki decks, take breaks to play with things I&#x27;m learning. But I get a touch overwhelmed with the feeling that I should be doing these things without really knowing if that&#x27;s an effective strategy to reading technical books. How do I best do this?",
