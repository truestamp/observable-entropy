      "text": "Im after suggestions for a good advertising network who serves trustworthy ads, for websites that have low volume of traffic that dont have much content. The obvious answer here is Adsense, however they tend to be approving sites which have lots of content these days according to the adsense community forums (and thus my website which could be described as a free service offering gets rejected).<p>I have tried a few of the common alternative ad networks such as Adsterra, PropellerAds and generally end up with NSFW content or full page content on my site when all I’m after is a simple banner ad.",

      "text": "According to the media and from watching my professional circle, it seems that many are indeed changing jobs with significant pay raises--the so-called Great Resignation.<p>I&#x27;d like to hear from HN about job changes and raises. Anecdotes are welcome, but ideally one of us works in HR and has systematic data.<p>But more importantly, I&#x27;d like to think through the reasons driving the Great Resignation. Below are several explanations with my own assessments.<p>1. People die from Covid, reducing the labor force. \n-&gt; Irrelevant for tech workers<p>2. People get large checks from the gov and are not pressured to find job. \n-&gt; Irrelevant for tech workers<p>3. People avoided changing jobs during the pandemic. So the high turnover now is simply making up for low turnover in 2020.\n-&gt; This does explain the high turnover, but not the significant raises. Indeed, the number of workers and jobs remains the same--people are shuffling between places. To be convinced of this theory, I&#x27;d like to see that raises are flat.<p>3. Senior workers are retiring early due to pandemic-related revelation. Mid-level workers are thus getting more promos than usual.\n-&gt; Seems plausible. To be convinced, I need to see mid-level workers getting raises, and entry-level workers NOT getting raises.<p>4. [My theory] Remote work allows better matching of people and jobs. Imagine that person A can deliver lots of value to company B, but is hitherto prevented to do so due to location. With remote work, Person A can now work for Company B and get paid higher accordingly.\n-&gt; To be convinced, I need to see that remote job offers have higher comp vs comparable non-remote job offers. If this theory is true, then the Great Resignation&#x2F;Remote Work makes the job market more efficient, creates value for society, and should be celebrated by employees and employers alike.<p>5. [My theory] The pandemic pushes society forward in terms of tech adoption, making tech workers even more valuable than before.\n-&gt; Seems plausible, since tech has become more valuable as a whole (e.g. stock price), not just salary. If this theory is true, then it is again a good thing for both tech workers and the broader society.",
