Previous courses have exposed me to beautiful ideas like Russell&#x27;s paradox, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem, and the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondance.<p>I&#x27;m currently slogging through the final chapters of Hofstader&#x27;s Gödel, Escher, Bach. What are some good next choices if I am interestred in diving deeper into the philosophy of mathematics?<p>Thanks!",
