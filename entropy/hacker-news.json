Since we only incorporated in February, nothing has vested, but we are both on the board.<p>What is the course of action here? Is there a place where I can find a template for some sort f a separation agreement that would detatch them from the company completely, including any shareholding and board positions?<p>Product is built but pre-launch, and, unfortunately, we are also in the middle of our pre-seed.

They did it in all sorts of ways: free courses, paid courses, books, schools, etc.<p>Almost all of them quit within weeks or months.<p>An interesting observation was to hear them describing why they quit too abstractly, too broadly. &quot;I didn&#x27;t like it.&quot; &quot;Couldn&#x27;t make the time to learn.&quot; &quot;Too hard.&quot; Things like that.<p>I&#x27;ve always felt that there&#x27;s so much more behind those answers. So much we could learn about why programming is so hard to enter, apart from the inherent domain complexity.<p>What&#x27;s your story, or that of someone you&#x27;ve seen quit?",
