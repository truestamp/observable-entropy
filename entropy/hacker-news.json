This got me thinking.<p>There are loads of maintainers out there feeling burnt out, but they can&#x27;t abandon their project since people are depending on the project to be maintained.<p>In an effort to combat this, I built a website that lists projects looking for new maintainers. It&#x27;s still quite empty and has some rough edges. Any feedback is very welcome!",
