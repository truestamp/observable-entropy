      "text": "Last year I started brainstorming a possible business idea in the fintech space with a friend.\nWe came up with a name and set up a static page with a form. We never formed a company.\nEventually, we decided that the idea wasn&#x27;t good enough. Last month we killed the landing page.<p>Last week, we received a letter from a French legal firm, asking us to stop using the name because it is somehow similar to their client company&#x27;s, which operates in a similar space.\nThey also request that we &quot;surrender&quot; the domain names that we purchased to the company for free.<p>Since the landing page is no longer online and the business idea is buried, I don&#x27;t worry too much.\nMy question is: do they have any right to order us to give up the domain names?<p>It sounds like a bullshit move to me. They can have the domain names, but they have to pay for them.<p>Note that the landing page was targeted at the European market, with a focus on Italy and Germany.",
