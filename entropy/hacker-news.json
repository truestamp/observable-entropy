In 2021, Portland moved up again to 6th-highest salaries.<p>How does the median SE salary of a place go up more than $40k&#x2F;yr in a couple years? What is the mechanism behind this sort of change? Is it companies opening new offices? Is it existing companies increasing their compensation package by a huge amount?<p>References: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.levels.fyi&#x2F;2021 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.levels.fyi&#x2F;2020&#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.levels.fyi&#x2F;2019&#x2F;",
