      "text": "A side project i&#x27;m working on is maxing out memory bandwidth well before cpu.   It reads data from a 43GB binary data file (cached in ram by OS), does some processing and generates an output file. On an AWS r6gd.16xlarge instance (64 cpu, 512GB ram) it takes 14 seconds to run with 64 threads.  I can reduce the number of threads down to 32 before it starts taking longer so it seems to be memory bandwidth limited.  The application is interactive so shorter run times are highly desirable.  I want to buy&#x2F;build a server to maximize performance, what are my options?<p>For the sake of discussion let&#x27;s assume the program is optimally written (Ha!).  Porting to GPU is also out of the question because some settings require 300GB of ram or more during processing.",
