      "text": "I&#x27;ve been contemplating relocating my job to Austin from the bay area, and I&#x27;m wondering others&#x27; experience with finding new roles once they&#x27;ve gone remote from the bay area? For me finding a role in the bay area was simple, fast, and generally well compensated... My fear is if I choose to find a new role with an Austin address I will either 1) get pigeon-holed as &quot;not bay area quality&quot; or get offers that assume I don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m worth etc.<p>Anecdotally I&#x27;ve had a friend who moved here and has since found it extremely hard to find a marketing role whereas he had his pick of them in the bay area.<p>Anyways, any stories to anecdotes to share good or bad?",
