      "text": "I&#x27;ve never used Twitch before other than seeing them on youtube, but I&#x27;m starting to get more curious about using it as a platform for engaging with an audience and&#x2F;or building a community etc..<p>I&#x27;m not a gamer and won&#x27;t be using it for that. I&#x27;m still not sure what <i>I</i> want to use it for, and that&#x27;s why I wanted to see how your experiences are with this, what kinds of live-streams you watch or know of, what topics, what format, using what types of features?, etc. And also why people even watch live-streams?? No judging, just curious because I don&#x27;t do it myself.<p>I&#x27;m also clueless as to how I would go about actually <i>starting</i> it. &#x27;Cause it&#x27;s not like youtube where I can clean up a video and present it and share it etc etc. Clearly when I start off there&#x27;s no audience? So I&#x27;m live-streaming to myself? Feels so sad haha. Is it normal to share this afterwards? How does one attract an audience?<p>Sorry for all the questions! Of course I can just start exploring Twitch myself but it&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother world and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be nearly as wide-scoped as asking on here.<p>Thanks!",
