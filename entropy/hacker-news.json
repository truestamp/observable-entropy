      "text": "The hoax behind fossil fuels, nothing more than a marketing gimmick to create the impression of scarcity and thereby drive the price up<p>Despite what we&#x27;ve been taught in our education system, &quot;fossil fuels&quot; do not in fact come from fossils nor of the transformed remains of long dead organisms.<p>The term &quot;fossil fuel&quot; was made up in 1892 by John D. Rockefeller, Standard Oil Company single owner, in order to induce the idea of scarcity easing the increase of oil price.<p>If everyone knew  oil was self-replenishing at a rate as fast as we wisely use it,\nand is the second most prevalent liquids available on earth after waters, we would have not been paying the amount we&#x27;ve been paying up now.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;abduAlbadii&#x2F;status&#x2F;1541313250742403073",
