      "text": "I mostly program on the side and basically every eight years or so I find the tech I comfortably use out-of-date. I &#x27;surface&#x27; to find a completely new world of platforms and technology and try to pick a new one to learn. The advice I get is mostly based on big commercial projects and the latest fancy tech.<p>Current example: \nWeb: I use AngularJS and can very quickly achieve what I want. I love its capability to run without a server from a local file. I cannot stand node.<p>Migration Decision: So far I believe I will migrate to Vue.js.<p>App &amp; Server: I use Google App Engine Standard, but the tools are getting worse and worse. I work on a shared Java codebase with Android Java, APIs on Cloud Endpoints work instantly. Google now pushes Kotlin on the app, I missed platform changes for 4 years.<p>Migration Decision: I am ready to abandon it all and go Flutter on the clients and Spring Boot on App Engine as the server. Or is that a good idea? Flutter is moving too fast. Whatever I do will likely be out of date in a year....<p>And there are many other platforms (Firebase Realtime, Firebase Auth, SQL server) that have had iterations, were acquired and have had so many iterations it&#x27;s impossible to catch up &#x27;after a tech coma&#x27;.<p>Anyone have a good idea how to deal with this? It&#x27;s almost as if you review and update detailed Architecture Decision Records....",
