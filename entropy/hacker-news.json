Have tried my hands at a few startups but haven&#x27;t made it yet.<p>I am planning to file for US green card using the $500K investment EB5 visa. The KEY requirements for EB-5 direct investment visa are that:\n- one invests $500K in a existing or new business\n- generate and sustain 10 NEW full time jobs for 2 years. this is key!\n- located in a TEA ( targeted employment area)\n- should have active role in management of the business (at least on paper!)<p>I don&#x27;t want to invest in my own company because - 1. 500K would be insufficient to sustain 10 jobs as tech salaries are too high. 2. 500K is all i have, and with my track record so far, can&#x27;t risk the startup failing and loosing both my investment and consequently the green card.<p>So any advise on safe business ideas or startups that one can invest in considering the above requirements!",
