It makes me assume quality of life isn’t factored into the mental illness equation. I think that not doing so is wrong because it makes healthcare used as a scapegoat to ignore that certain quality of life shouldn’t be lived. Unless we humans think that any quality of life regardless of how bad should be lived?",
