This means I have no company-provided health insurance and after recently finding that my local private and public health insurance options are lacking, I&#x27;ve come looking for better options.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Bupa, Allianz, Best Doctors, SafteyWing, etc - but many reviews are not necessarily from people who use these services, so I&#x27;m asking here if anyone would like to share their experiences or thoughts on the subject of international health insurance.",
