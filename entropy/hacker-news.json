I also had a programming course.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve enrolled for weekend school for Data Visualisation. Where I learn Jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib etc.<p>I live in Europe, my parents are stuck in Ukraine and I need to start working asap.<p>- How would you suggest going about internship &#x2F; junior position? I still feel like I&#x27;m not good enough to work.<p>- Any Data science blogs &#x2F; job boards that I should follow?<p>- What makes sense in the portfolio? Some homemade projects in Jupiter &#x2F; kaggle? Does is make sense to link them to cv?<p>thanks",

Durability: battery life is important to me as well as general longevity of the hardware i.e. I would like it to last a long time.<p>2. Linux support: I use Linux as my OS of choice and I have <i>no</i> intention of using Windows&#x2F;MacOS<p>3. Optimized for intensive computing usage.<p>Other things of note:<p>I looked into the Framework laptops and so far it looks like they are still a bit beta.<p>However, I <i>am</i> curious about users&#x27; experiences with:<p>* the KDE Slimbook 15: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slimbook.es&#x2F;en&#x2F;store&#x2F;slimbook-kde&#x2F;kde-slimbook-15-comprar<p>* the Purism Librem 14: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;puri.sm&#x2F;products&#x2F;librem-14&#x2F;<p>* Kubuntu Focus: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kfocus.org&#x2F;order&#x2F;order-m2.html<p>* the StarBook 14-inch – Star Labs®: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starlabs.systems&#x2F;pages&#x2F;starbook<p>Also tips about maintaining battery life would be appreciated. I&#x27;ve read too much conflicting advice about that lately :) Thanks.",
