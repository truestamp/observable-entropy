      "text": "Any thoughts or suggestions for which industries, use cases or systems could be potential targets for our customer discovery?<p>We are working on a data integration solution to connect systems that are hard or impossible to connect. We come from the nonprofit space where we encountered this need first, where social workers have to manually copy and paste service-related data daily&#x2F;weekly into a government or another compliance system that does not have APIs or is otherwise not accessible. We have successfully built an RPA-based software to integrate their CRM system with their compliance system.<p>We are aware of other companies (UI Path etc.) that offer RPA capabilities. While they are more broadly focused on automation, we are focusing on the data integration space.<p>We would like to more widely understand the potential of such a solution and are looking to talk to folks in other industries that have encountered such systems that may lack APIs or traditional means of integration.<p>Do you know of industries other than Nonprofits that can benefit from our technology? I’d appreciate any feedback.<p>Here’s our website (www.quinteo.com) in case you are interested.<p>Thank you!\nDanny",
