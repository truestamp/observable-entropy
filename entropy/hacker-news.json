Probably will only be a blimp in the long run, but still, at the moment, not a way to boost morale.<p>I know there is a whole industry of &quot;good news&quot; side, but they usually concentrate on &quot;heartwarming stories&quot; of child helping puppies, veterans coming home  - this is not really what I&#x27;m asking for.<p>What would be the slow-moving, unspectacular, long-term good,covid-indepedant trend that everyone glued to the news site would be missing those days ?",
