      "text": "Hi all. I&#x27;m a mid-20s Economics major who has been thinking about transitioning into software engineering, and am wondering what the long-term career prospects are like for someone without a CS degree. That is, even if I managed to find an entry-level job, would I ever be taken seriously for promotion?<p>For background, I&#x27;m currently working in finance, but have been coding as a hobby since grade school and have started to think about making a career out of it. My sense is that some tech companies are willing to hire people without CS degrees if they have the requisite skills, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what their attitude was toward the same people after they got their foot in the door. I imagine a CS degree has both substantive value and signalling value, and wasn&#x27;t sure how disadvantaged I&#x27;d be to lack that background.<p>Thanks in advance for your input.",
