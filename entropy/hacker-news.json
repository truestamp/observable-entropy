      "text": "It is my impression that there is organized crime occurring within Samsung and&#x2F;or Samsung&#x27;s Customer Support associates.<p>I placed an order for 870 QVO SATA III 2.5&quot; SSD 8TB (total amount charged to my credit card: $816.19) on April 18th, 2022. On April 26th, 2022, I received 870 QVO SATA III 2.5&quot; SSD 1TB, an item which I did not order. The item sent by Samsung is only a 1TB SSD (retail cost: $109.99). In plain English: Samsung charged me for a product advertised as containing 8 terrabytes of storage capacity and charged me $816.19, but they sent me a product containing only 1 terabyte of storage capacity (retail cost: $109.99).<p>I contacted Samsung via chat and by phone to request a full refund. I received email tickets of both the online chat that occurred through Samsung.com, as well as an email ticket following up on the phone call. The email support person also asked for my name, address, phone number and email address. The phone support person asked for the same information. She also asked for photos of the box and FedEx label, as well as a photo of the one terrabyte SSD.<p>I noticed that the email tickets were from two different domains:<p>support@seaecomm.zendesk.com and support@samsungamazontradein.zendesk.com.",
