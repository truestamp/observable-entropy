I am struggling to load some websites when I have a few programs running.<p>I have also noticed that when I first launch it is almost UNUSEABLE while it struggles to handle mouse input, keyboard input, audio delays, and frankly....this is one of the worst experiences I have had with a computer.<p>Windows SUCKS! But as a fan of Lenovo for the past 10 years and an ardent linux fan - I was expecting that this mac would compete....<p>---<p>Previously Macs don&#x27;t slow down...so Its either the latest OS or its the M1 itself... but something is getting worse and worse.<p>Am I crazy?
