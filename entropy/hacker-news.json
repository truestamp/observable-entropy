How do you approach this problem and how do you even talk about it?<p>This is very specific to my EU&#x2F;Singapore experience so I am not sure how big of a problem this is in the US&#x2F;North America.<p>Even though the working language is english there&#x27;s usually teams where one person decides to always hire people of his ethnicity or people that speak a specific language.<p>Meetings with such team is always awkward as they internally discuss the topic in their own language during the meeting. Also their hiring practices are essentially discriminatory.",

My requirements are:<p>* decent support for multiple accounts<p>* Support for IMAP as well as Exchange<p>* Exchange calendar sync, all other features are kind of optional (lean would be preferred)<p>I tried those alternatives, but none seem to do quite what I want:<p>* Windows Mail: I actually really like the app, it&#x27;s leaner and faster than Outlook, but it has one major bug on my machine: it&#x27;s using the same &quot;Sent From&quot; name on all accounts and doesn&#x27;t let me edit it. I found an blog post describing the same problem and how a reinstall helped them, but for me not even that does the trick.<p>* Thunderbird: this would be my favourite, but it doesn&#x27;t support Exchange",
