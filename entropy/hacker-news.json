      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for a web server to use for local development and testing. My requirements are:<p>Simple to configure with one config file<p>Included as a package in most distributions<p>Supports CGI, access.log, HTTP Basic auth and htpasswd format, SSI, HTTP 1.1, setting expire headers, rewrite rules.<p>Stable configuration format<p>I&#x27;ve been using lighttpd for a while, but I am frustrated by its configuration churn. Every couple of version some option becomes &quot;deprecated&quot; with another one to replace it. This results in warnings when I launch it, extra work I have to do to get rid of them, and then managing these changes between all the different lighttpd versions I now have to support.<p>Does anyone know a good alternative?",
