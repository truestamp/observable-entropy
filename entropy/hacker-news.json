It seems that in Europe and especially parts of Asia people still expect business cards and not alternatives... some we thought of were:<p>Card with info printed on but also on nf and as a qr code (or with fancy conductive ink)<p>Goodies like USB Sticks&#x2F;cards with pre prepared stuff<p>Useful everyday items like... aluminium Multitool cards, post it, bottle openers (not great for formal settings) or whatnot<p>Coins, wooden forms, alu poker chips and other alternative shapes and materials<p>Nothing-&gt; exchange via mobile<p>Anyone has experiences or ideas on alternatives that engage?",
