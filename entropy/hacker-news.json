      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Fastmail with wildcard aliases on a custom domain for over a year. In general, I love it, and I have few complaints. One area that I&#x27;ve run into trouble with though is accessing emails when I&#x27;m offline. This can be especially bad when I need to access tickets or other documents from my email in a place where I have no signal. Almost got stuck at the airport because I couldn&#x27;t pull up a covid test that I&#x27;d saved to my email. Since the Fastmail app on iOS doesn&#x27;t support offline emails, I&#x27;m looking into a third party client that does. There are so many clients out there, but one feature I&#x27;m having trouble finding is the ability to send emails from wildcard aliases. Are there any clients out there that support this?",
