      "text": "Why does my brain refuse to turn off? What purpose is my brain if cannot preform such a basic function as turning off. How is it that my consciousness never seems be repressed. The moment consciousness is programmed to go out from the chemical hormones and biological systems, my consciousness is there to interrupt this. I give up on believing that my conscious thoughts and actions have any effect on whatever unconscious errors that unpredictably malfunction because of what? Genetics, stress, idk. How can I reset this brain and let it do one of its most basic functions that for some reason decides to not work regardless of any activity, hormone, sleep quality, circadian rhythm. I give up and am reporting an issue with my brain or the DNA replication that failed when i was born or something.",

      "text": "Over the past few weeks I&#x27;ve been in five separate instances where I needed a company to help me something, and I could not reach a human.  Instead, I had to open tickets that went nowhere, reply to tickets via email, be told conflicting things by different people via email...  It&#x27;s so frustrating, and I&#x27;m sure there are others who experience this.<p>Part of me thinks (perhaps naively) if I had the ability to speak with a real person over the phone, we could sort this out instead of constant emails or creating tickets that go into a black hole.  As more companies outsource, automate, or severely cut their customer service department, there needs to be some kind of pressure to stop these frustrating experiences from happening.  Voting with our dollars doesn&#x27;t work when these companies are so integrated with our lives.",
