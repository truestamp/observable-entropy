Been fun exploring what’s been done since 1972. However, based on what I know, Cryptocurrencies are a dangerous scam. Way too many ways to cheat people who don’t have a clue what they are paying for.",

      "text": "I was thinking about a concept lately I would refer to as type coverage.<p>The idea behind it is to measure how well a python function is tested by recording all inputs&#x2F;outputs during a complete test run and comparing the values with the annotated types.<p>e.g. a function `foo(a: Optional[float])` which is only tested with `foo(5)` gets a low coverage because `foo(None)` is not being tested. Or it could be hinted that a more feasible type annotation would be `foo(a: int)`.<p>As a use case I was thinking of testing APIs, to make sure you covered all use cases of your API which you advertise by the annotated types.<p>An extension of this concept could be that you check how extensive you tested a type. Like did you test `foo(a: int)` with negative, positive and zero values? \nIf not it could be a hint that your test coverage is too low or you have a wrong type, maybe a enum would be suited better.<p>I am curious to hear about your thoughts about this concept.",
