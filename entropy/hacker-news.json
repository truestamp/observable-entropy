      "text": "I&#x27;m a new grad (this spring) from a state school majoring in CS. I love software development, and although I only started in college, it&#x27;s what I want to do in my career. However before then I wanted to be a &#x27;sysadmin&#x27; and did a lot of Linux&#x2F;DB&#x2F;cloud stuff (starting with game servers and forums) so I have a good amount of experience in I guess what would be called &quot;systems engineering.&quot; Hence why I was given a good offer at a proprietary trading firm doing just that. But I&#x27;m worried that I won&#x27;t feel fulfilled or I&#x27;ll have my professional growth stunted by accepting the position, and that recruiters&#x2F;peers will see me as &#x27;just&#x27; a systems engineer; even when I have a CS degree and will likely be writing code (just more along the lines of automation&#x2F;scripts&#x2F;some APIs) every day. On the other hand this is the best offer I&#x27;ve had yet (including over SWE roles) and I don&#x27;t want to let it go.<p>Am I just overthinking this first professional role or are my fears that I&#x27;ll be pigeonholed later justified?",
