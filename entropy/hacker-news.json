It would help spread knowledge about the features that come with familiarity, and provide some explicit notions of reasonable UX design for new UX designers.<p>*What do you like about HN?*<p>I&#x27;m a fan of HN&#x27;s user-centric design. I really appreciate the favorites feature in particular, specifically about how favoriting a thread brings you to your favorites. It&#x27;s a very functional bookmark system.<p>*What would you like to see improved?*<p>There are only two features I wish HN had: a way to remove the karma counts, and some method to receive notice about replies to comments&#x2F;submissions. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to cobble it together, given the user-centric design; there&#x27;s probably a way to cobble these features together, it would just be nice to have natively.<p>Wishing everyone and your loved ones the best! Hope y&#x27;all are having a good day, and stay safe :)",
