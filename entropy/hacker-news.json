I&#x27;ve looked at quite a few bands, rings and watches, and haven&#x27;t found anything good.<p>Problems:<p>Very uncomfortable to wear that it affects sleep<p>Not accurate enough<p>Data not easily exportable, or behind paywalls<p>Privacy issues (although this one can probably be worked around by not providing real identity)<p>In particular, I was eyeing on the Oura Ring, which had pretty good reviews. But they recently switched to a subscription model. This really puts me off because it tends to get downhill from there.<p>Have you found any good ones?",
