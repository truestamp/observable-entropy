It led to this silly little website [3].<p>I am sure that this deserved to be taken down and was a clear violation of the rules and&#x2F;or culture here, do not want to say anything otherwise.  I just thought it was enjoyable and a kind cathartic thing, and I realize that, while it has no place in the professional world of HN (presumably), I wish I knew of a place like HN where this kind of stuff was ok.  Does that exist? A HN with maybe more workers than bosses&#x2F;founders, with a wider threshold for maybe critical and&#x2F;or silly writing, that&#x27;s still in the general world of tech.<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31424170<p>2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brutalist.report&#x2F;<p>3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;limadrive.com&#x2F;assessment&#x2F;",
