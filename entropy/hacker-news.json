Currently, I am cold-messaging via LinkedIn CTOs of these companies but the approach doesn&#x27;t feel very efficient.<p>This leaves me wondering the following two things:<p>1. Am I getting in touch with the actual target customers? What do you think would be the most efficient way to quickly validate or refute my hypothesis?\n2. How would you efficiently contact startups and small businesses developing iOS applications and&#x2F;or building their QA team?<p>Thanks a lot in advance",
