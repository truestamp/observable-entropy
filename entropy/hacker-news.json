I get that that’s nowhere near the money most people on here make, but I am only 20 years old.<p>I have the advantage of being extremely flexible, I can make changes in all sorts of ways to optimize for a certain goal… usually it’s only my own discipline (or lack of) that stands in the way.<p>Lately I’ve learned that I have a taste for an expensive lifestyle and I want to explore that angle a bit more which is why I’ve been looking for ways to use the money I already have to invest and get a return on it.<p>With time on my side, I don’t mind making investments that won’t see returns until a few years down the line, I just have no clue where to start.<p>I don’t care about being filthy rich, I want a GTR not a Lamborghini.",
