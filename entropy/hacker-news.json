      "text": "Is that time of the year when I have to buy my landlord&#x27;s kids presents in exchange for him buying me Romanian unhealty food and booze :)<p>The youngest one, about 11, seems to like robots&#x2F;computers. I want to get him a starting programming kit of sorts. Myself I started with a ZX Spectrum clone, that came with a booklet with some stuff I could do with the computer. So I was thinking to get him something like a RPI with a keyboard and preinstalled dev environment he can play with. Anything like that?<p>I don&#x27;t have lots of time atm to do it myself, thus I&#x27;m looking for an already made solution.",
