      "text": "Non industry person here, basically curious about the question in the title.<p>With all the hype about coins, defi, and NFTs, I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding information about projects using blockchain technology for an actual functional purpose.<p>For example - I&#x27;ve always imagined there would be a lot of value in the intersection of blockchain&#x2F;mesh networks&#x2F;content-centric networking to create a sort of &quot;co-op&quot; decentralized mesh network. The distributed ledger would serve as the map of content, and allow some financial benefit to accrue for providing&#x2F;supporting an access node to the mesh network. But it doesn&#x27;t seem like we&#x27;re yet at the point where non-blockchain people can use the technology for other purposes.<p>Am I wrong in this regard? Is there a better way to sift through all the hype&#x2F;noise? And does anyone have any interesting examples of blockchain being used in functional, or at least in not-purely-financial, ways?",
