      "text": "I am a FAANG tech worker bee (experience as software engineer, tech lead and engineering manager) who is growing significantly tired of the corporate rat race, and the fact that I have really no control over pretty much anything I do all day at work, I am at the whims of corporate politics that make every effort I spend objectively pointless, if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that it pays my salary. As such, I am looking to start some sort of pet project to satisfy my craving for ownership.<p>I think over the years I gained a unique perspective when it comes to personal finance, financial independence and passive investments, working in tech, tech compensations, startups and equity, and similar topics (a few snippets of this &quot;wisdom&quot; are available in my other comment down below). I routinely get calls from friends&#x2F;acquaintances&#x2F;ex coworkers asking for advice regarding one of these topics.<p>I am trying to understand if it would be worth starting a blog that covers these subjects. The goal would be to eventually monetize this in some way (ads, affiliate, consultations, …) just so that I could consider it worth my time.<p>Do you think this could be a viable strategy, or am I embarking on a sad journey that after thousands of hours spent creating content would leave me with nothing valuable to show for? A brutally honest answer would be highly appreciated, since I haven&#x27;t started yet.<p>Thanks",

      "text": "I&#x27;m a software engineer with 20 years experience, 8 years at my current employer. I am happy with my position and employer. That is until recently. I was notified I would have to start taking a week long 24&#x2F;7 on-call rotation with 5 other team members. So, I am on-call 1 week out of 6 weeks. The alerts are generated from DataDog&#x2F;New Relic monitors. I have never handled on-call after hours and I&#x27;m not excited to start at this point in my career with many family obligations and a desire for clear work&#x2F;life boundaries. I was offered no additional compensation for the added responsibilities. I find being on-call invasive and disruptive, not only for me but also my family. When on-call, I sleep in a separate room from my wife so that her sleep is not disrupted. I also have a hard time falling asleep knowing that an alert could go off at any time.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear how common this is in the industry. Are you on-call? Was it part of your initial hire responsibilities or added later? Did you receive any compensation for your duties? Am I going to be in the same situation if I change jobs&#x2F;companies?",
