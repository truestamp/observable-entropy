      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m curious to learn which companies use big multi-language monorepos these days? (not javascript &quot;project monorepos&quot;, Bazel like things)<p>If you work in such a company and can share any of the following it&#x27;s even more interesting:\n- Roughly how many engineers share the repo?\n- What languages and tooling do you use? (Bazel? Pants? git? GitHub? Jenkins?)\n- Do you personally feel like the setup works well for the company? (and is this the general sentiment among engineers in the company?)<p>Thanks!",
