      "text": "If there are about 4 generations per century, there are about 80 generations since Caesar&#x2F;Christ. With every parental generation the number of your ancestors doubles. So you have 2^80 ancestors going back 2000 years. That is 10^23. With estimates of all humans ever in existence being about 10^11 that means everyone is directly related to everyone multiple multiple times.<p>Anyone on earth who had reproductive children back than is now your ancestor, to varying degrees of course. Even Caesar. Even jungle people from the most remote places, because one single contact half way connects the graphs.<p>So if someone asks you if you are related to Caesar the next time you have to answer with a resounding Yes!",
