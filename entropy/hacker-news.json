      "text": "Been out of touch in this area, for a while, i.e. since my last &quot;private cloud&quot; project, during which I had available solutions like HCI of the likes of Nutanix, Cisco, HP and an immature (at the time) AWS Outpost, all with their own HA and storage solution.<p>I am now in position to revisit and maybe reconsider options, for replacement (if not expansion of existing, if solution allows for such) of what appears to me as a *non-scalable* design at this time. The solution consists of a 3-nodes Proxmox cluster (KVM cluster for VMs and containers), with CEPH shared storage, sync-ed over infiniband, using some local disks. I would really like to end up with a much more scalable solution (add components more easily, as demand on (v)CPU and mem grows), with HA preferably not only &quot;inside&quot; a DC, but also across multiple (active&#x2F;active, if possible) DCs, more scalable storage, etc., etc.<p>Simple Q, after long description: what is your source of latest updates in this space? I started my search with TechField Day and GreyBeards&#x27; sites, but would appreciate some more info ...",
