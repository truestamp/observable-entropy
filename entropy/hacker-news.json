      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m currently working on Letlang[0] as a side project, TLDR: this is a general purpose programming language which compiles to Rust.<p>Right now, the repository is not open-source, mainly because I have not chosen a license yet.<p>Most of the time, I release softwares or libraries under the terms of the MIT license, because I do not really care about who can use the code. Sometimes I release them under the terms of the Apache Public License 2.0, when I care about the name but still not about who can use the code.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if this software should be released under the terms of the GPL (2 or 3? i don&#x27;t know), I want to keep things open, included external contributions, so this seems like a good fit.<p>What I&#x27;m not sure about is about the &quot;contamination&quot; of the GPL:<p><pre><code>  - does the templates I use to generate Rust code would &quot;contaminate&quot; the produced code? (I don&#x27;t want to)\n  - does the runtime crate I link statically with the generated Rust code would &quot;contaminate&quot; the final library&#x2F;executable? (I don&#x27;t want to)\n</code></pre>\nIf the answer is yes to the previous questions, then the GPL would be a bad fit. Then, what license should I use?<p>Thank you in advance HN :)<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letlang.dev",
