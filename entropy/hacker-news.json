      "text": "I complained the other day on HN that one of my video files hosted in some company that specializes in hosting large files was blocked as copyright violation and our clients could not download it even though we have produced this file ourselves. And no we did not film anything even remotely copyrightable. It happened few month ago and all complaints went to a black hole and they kept repeating this copyright mantra.<p>Lo and behold. Today I get an email from a company saying that said violation was reported to them by Google and they restored the file and more than that are giving 3 month free hosting. Kudos to that company. They did very respectable and graceful thing in the end.<p>Google on the other hand seems to have reach that goes beyond reasonable.",
