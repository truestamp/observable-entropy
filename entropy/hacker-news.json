      "text": "Hey all,<p>A project I&#x27;ve been working on for the past few months just entered the beta testing phase and, since HN with its insightful and helpful comment section is one of the inspirations, I wanted to share it with you!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;test-convey.aletheiaware.com<p>Convey is a Communication Platform that Incentivizes Quality Content, Collaboration, and Discussion.<p>The two aspects that set Convey apart from the status quo are the incentive mechanism and the digest.<p>Incentive Mechanism<p>Unlike most platforms, authors pay per byte to post on Convey which incentivizes brevity. Similarly commenters also pay per byte to comment but half of the coins they spend is paid to the author of the parent post so quality content that generates collaboration, discussion, and debate rewards authors more than spam, harassment, and hate.<p>Digest<p>Each month, the posts with the highest yields are published into a digest enabling authors to reach a larger audience while readers enjoy quality content covering a diverse range of topics.<p>As always the code is open source and hosted on Github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AletheiaWareLLC&#x2F;conveyearthgo<p>I hope you&#x27;ll try it out and share your feedback!<p>Thanks,<p>Stuart",
