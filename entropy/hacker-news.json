      "text": "I recently became a Canadian citizen. (Toronto, ON)\nUpon visiting a friend in LA, a thought of living permanently in the states came to my mind, for two reasons, generally better pay for software engineer and better climate. My wife and I are eyeing TX and WA. I just wanted to hear HN&#x27;s input on it, preferably those who has gone similar paths. For background info, my wife and I are both Canadians, both age 31, no kids. Wife is a RFP manager and I&#x27;m a senior software engineer (E-comm, serverless, distributed, typescript, php, python) both of us have 4yr Uni degree in Canada.<p>My questions are:\n1. What states do you recommend considering the weather &amp; tax rates.\n2. How should I start? Do I start interviewing asking them for H1B right away?\n3. Any employers to avoid on?\n4. Any concerns&#x2F;tips on moving to the states from Canada.<p>Thanks in advance.",
