      "text": "I&#x27;m doing a bit of an introspective at work in my behaviour around meetings.<p>I have 3 to 5 meetings&#x2F;calls every day, with both colleagues and external parties.<p>Sometimes I walk into a meeting fully prepared (I look at notes from our last meeting, prep some questions to ask, look them up on Google&#x2F;LinkedIn if it&#x27;s someone new, etc.) and sometimes not so much prepared.<p>For the unprepared ones, it often feels like last minute (&quot;oh shit I have this call in 2min, where is the zoom link, what&#x27;s this about again, I should have checked 30min ago&quot;),ultimately making me feel bad about it - a feeling that sticks before, during and after the meeting even though the conversation might be productive.<p>Does anyone else get a similar feeling? If you do, do you think this feeling is because you&#x27;re not on top of things (which you take pride in) or because you might look unprepared and foolish to the other(s) in the meeting? Did you implement small hacks to never miss a beat?",
