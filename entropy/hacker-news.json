I couldn&#x27;t ask anything else about it because I got a pit in my stomach and waited till the end of the session and then dove in, the artist is young college age and has a group with other young tattoo artist, and they were laughing in it about how accurately they can nail how many doses people have had and when (including me) by how their skin and blood reacts to the tattoo.<p>Am I right to feel a bit weird about this?",

A good indicator is the huge amount of very popular &quot;how-to-x&quot; videos on YouTube.<p>2. A small group of people has very elaborate setups. They often use multiple tools, code plugins, or self-made solutions and after many iterations find their system. They often end up with amazing workflows and probably amazing outcomes.<p>In short, the potential is huge but most users don&#x27;t reach it. It’s a pain for them because they struggle while they see others magically succeeding (on YouTube, Twitter, ...).",
