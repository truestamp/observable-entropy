      "text": "Hello HN. I did the big mistake of being signed in to my work Google account when I created my YouTube channel. The channel in question is my artist channel where i publish my music etc.<p>I didn&#x27;t realize at the moment I created the channel, that I was signed in to my work account. And now I&#x27;m worried that I would lose access to this account one day if I where to get fired, quit etc.<p>I can&#x27;t seem to find any way to transfer the channel to my private account. Is this just plain and simply impossible?",
