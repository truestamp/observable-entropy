      "text": "I thought I&#x27;d give it Apple Music a try after the recent Spotify-Rogan-Young debacle. Overall, I&#x27;m finding the experience to be pretty good, however these small things are really quite annoying when coming from Spotify:<p>* Mac Music app &amp; iPhone App don&#x27;t sync up what&#x27;s currently playing. So, I can&#x27;t control it from my phone while playing from my laptop.<p>* No Liked&#x2F;Loved Songs playlist that automatically adds songs I&#x27;ve &quot;loved&quot;.<p>* Loving songs should be an icon on desktop app, not a 2-click thru a drop-down.<p>---<p>On the flipside, things I like:<p>* Easily access recently played history<p>* Seemingly better sound quality<p>---<p>What are your pro &#x2F; cons?",
