      "text": "Get funded?<p>I created a few scripts to automate my personal take on music marketing and to market my musical releases. Observing my results, a few musicians asked me to do the same for them and I charge them for it. I am actually making money running their marketing campaigns and I am starting to think of creating a platform out this. I talked with a few music labels too and I got some excited people waiting for the platform to be ready.<p>The problem: I got a 9-5 programming job that pays the bills and I got a recently born baby, no free time (and no mental capacity) anymore to work on my platform, despite having people asking about the progress of almost daily. Also I have not enough savings to quit my job.<p>Dream Scenario: I would love to get some funding so I can pay my bills and dedicate 40H weekly on developing my platform.<p>Is it dreaming too much? Do you guys think it would be possible? How so? I’m open to suggestions.<p>Cheers",
