      "text": "Hello HN,<p>Due to the pandemic and an influx of stress recently, I went into self contemplation and tried to find what I don&#x27;t like about my life. One of the things that stood out was that, regarding my career and my love for computing, my knowledge feels wide but shallow. I feel that this is limiting my creative capacity and my ability to create fun and interesting things. As an example, I see articles here about reasonably complex subjects and am mostly capable of following them, but lack the inspiration to create something of my own that would not be a copy or close derivative of the articles I read.<p>In contrast, I see that some people find their niche, be it creating a site with auto-generated fractal art or their own text editor or even entire operating systems. I admire them but at the same time, I struggle to understand how they get their motivation.<p>If I spend a sizeable amount of energy exploring a niche subject and I end up not finding it satisfying, the energy feels wasted as the knowledge does not always transfer to the rest of my activities. At the same time, since I cannot relate my current activities to something I&#x27;m not familiar with, it&#x27;s hard to judge before hand.<p>I&#x27;ve tried the approach of trying out everything I find interesting, but combined with full-time work and the amount of information online, most attempts have remained very shallow with little to show for it.<p>For people who feel that they have found their niche(s), what was your path towards them and how do you know if a project will be something worth pursuing for your personal enjoyment?",
