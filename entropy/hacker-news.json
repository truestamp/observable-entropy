      "text": "So I searched for site on Google, for a couple reasons, I’d rather not disclose the specific site, but it’s been up for years and is typically the first result when you search the sites name.<p>I’ve been to this site many times, but today, something odd started happening. If I search the site in Google, the correct site is indeed the first result.<p>The problem is when I clicked this link, it sends me to a different URL, one that gives me spammy vibes. At first I wondered if the site was hijacked. It has never supported HTTPS, so I figured maybe they just got hacked. But strangely, and hour or so ago, I didn’t have this issue.<p>The part where it gets strange is when I browse the URL directly, I get the correct page, not the spam site. Also, if I long press the google result link and wait for the Safari preview, it shows the right site, as does opening in a new tab. I hopped over to my PC, searched for the site and clicked the link, and it all looks good there.<p>I can’t even begin to imagine what going on. Maybe some strange UA&#x2F;referrer&#x2F;etc. hack, but this has only been observed about an hour ago.",
