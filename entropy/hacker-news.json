And I hear about people creating them and using them with much success in their business. I&#x27;ve never really used one, and I&#x27;m not even sure how they&#x27;re being used. I realize I&#x27;m at risk of sounding really silly here, but they sound like great tools that I&#x27;m not taking advantage and I&#x27;m not sure how.<p>I&#x27;ve used SOPs in operations before. Checklists and requirements and &quot;thou shalt do X&quot; and what not. But I&#x27;ve never been &quot;wowed&quot; by a system or really seen its benefit firsthand.<p>As an engineer, I understand the benefit of having a system you can iterate on and improve over time, but how are people actually implementing these in their business?<p>I know this is a vague question, here are a few concrete ones:<p>- Are you currently using playbooks?\n- When?\n- How?\n- For what purpose?\n- Have you ever created one for your company?",
