Given that I&#x27;d like for you all to understand and remember that the vast majority of the russian population has never voted for this government and it&#x27;s actions do not represent the will of the russian people.<p>This is not a conjecture, it&#x27;s a mathematical fact, you can explore the results of the recent elections yourself and see the scale of the perpetrated fraud: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ruselection.herokuapp.com&#x2F;russian-election-anomalies?locale=en<p>Most trusted russian election analyst Sergey Shpilkin estimates that without the &quot;election anomalies&quot;, the current government has likely received around 31–33% of the votes with an estimated real election turnout of around 38%.<p>Considering that turnout that comes out to around 12.8% of all eligible russian voters that actually voted for the current ruling party. Despite the complete government control over almost all russian media that has been spouting non-stop propaganda for well over a decade, only a tenth of the population has willingly given them their votes.<p>If it was up to the russian people, this government would not be in power right now, making the decisions it is currently making.",
