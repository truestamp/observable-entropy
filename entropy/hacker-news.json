      "text": "I&#x27;ve just recently bought my first house. Nerd that I am, I want to smart home it. But I don&#x27;t want to use existing solutions, either because of (perceived) lock-in (google, amazon) or because of &quot;internet of shitty things&quot; &#x2F; privacy concerns (ADT, &quot;Unauthorized Bread&quot;). So I&#x27;m looking for resources (code, tutorials &amp; articles, and hardware) to make this happen.<p>Main categories are:<p>- Lighting: Both cool (colors!) and functional (remote on&#x2F;off). I hear Nanoleaf makes some cool stuff.\n- Gardening. The existing automation for watering is good, if not everywhere, but it&#x27;s old and I want to measure soil health, moisture, etc.\n- Security. I want to know which doors and windows are open, and then from there, determine security rules.\n- HVAC. Ties in with the above - get more granular control over which rooms gets what, as well as, say, turning off HVAC to rooms while windows are open.\n- Modeling. It&#x27;d be super cool to have everything displayed on a 3D model of the house. Plus, there&#x27;s all the old dreams of augmented-reality diagrams, plans, and etc.<p>I appreciate any advice and links folks want to toss my way!",
