      "text": "I recently migrated from a longtime Spotify subscription to Tidal after getting sold on the CD bitrate. After going through the common procedure of paying a third-party to migrate my saved tracks&#x2F;playlists&#x2F;artists it was a pretty rocky experience as I really started to get the hang of the suggestion algorithms and feedback loops. The general flavor of the songs and artists popping up on track radios was so alien to me. Streaming services have replaced radio and the algorithms used to feed the listener have taken on the role of the DJ.<p>I&#x27;m curious if there is a way someone has found to use one service&#x27;s algorithm to fetch content that is consumed on another. I am ready to dig deep into the APIs of Spotify, etc. but I want to know if someone else has gone down this path before? What were the largest hurdles?",
