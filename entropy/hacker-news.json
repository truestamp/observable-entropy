      "text": "I know there are several attack vectors on public Wifi, but these days are they mostly mitigated?<p>- Man-in-the-middle attacks: thwarted by certificate authority checking by the browser and&#x2F;or certificate pinning in mobile apps. Browser will not let you advance if the certificate is invalid. \n - Replay attacks: OAuth tokens expire and good sites will use nonces.\n - Packing sniffing on open networks: thwarted by TSL over http and encrypted traffic (unless you have a root certificate installed).\n - DNS lookups are somewhat plaintext, but now started to be done over https. Even then, attackers would know what you&#x27;re connected to, but not what you are saying.\n - Port scanning&#x2F;direct attacks: Firewalls by default lock down ports and well-patched machines prevent this\n - Email (SMTP) and other protocols: are all encrypted as well to prevent snooping.<p>Is using public Wifi actually dangerous? If so, what&#x27;s the attack vector?",
