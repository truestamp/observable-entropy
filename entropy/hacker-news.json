      "text": "I hear a lot of people here talk about the ethics of meat consumption and I tend to agree that it would be better to produce less emissions. However I have also heard people who had autoimmune issues get much better from trying a carnivore diet. I have some such issues that make me want to try this but I also want to consider the impact this will have on others. If I am eating meat to maybe solve a medical problem then maybe that is less bad than somebody who eats it just because it tastes good, but on the other hand the lifetime impact of somebody eating essentially all meat is significant for carbon. Thoughts?<p>Btw I hope that in the long term lab grown meat will make this less of a problem.",
