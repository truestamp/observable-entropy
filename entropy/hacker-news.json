Like many of you, I&#x27;m spending almost all day sitting or standing still at my computer and I enjoy it as long as my body cooperates.<p>There are enough scientific proof and personal experience showing while I&#x27;m losing muscle it starts getting harder and harder to sit and work. Back pain, shoulder pain, etc. no matter how correct I sit&#x2F;stand.<p>I hate gym and exercising (even though I used to be a serious gymnast between ages 9-18) but there&#x27;s no choice but to be active and build enough muscle, otherwise, I can&#x27;t continue sitting and doing the work I love for long hours.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a reliable, trustworthy, and scientific guide or program for building muscle. I&#x27;m not necessarily looking for motivation or coaching, just a proven program that helps me gain and maintain enough muscle to stay healthy. Also, it doesn&#x27;t need to be an app.",
