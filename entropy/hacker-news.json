      "text": "As a developer with less than two years of industry experience, I&#x27;m considering to open source my side project and add a new line on my CV.<p>Having only worked in one company, a fellow colleague could argue there&#x27;s a resemblance in the code design and tech stack used in my side project.\nI started my side project before I started this work, but after getting used to some patterns and technologies doing 9-to-5, they started getting used on side projects too. The resemblance ends there and the products are not related.\nConsequently, I quickly got experienced in the technologies used in my team&#x27;s scope.<p>Is this kind of similarity, using the same &quot;toolbox&quot; you use at work for side projects, an issue when deciding to open source a project?",
