      "text": "A close friend of mine recently had their Instagram account hacked — they clicked a link in a DM from a friend&#x27;s account that had already been compromised, and the attackers managed to change his email and phone number and are not busy churning out crypto scam nonsense (including in DMs, story posts, you name it). I&#x27;d helped them set up 2FA on their email and other socials in the past but this one must have been forgotten, so the password compromise let them take over.<p>Any human review of his account would be able to tell in a matter of seconds that it&#x27;s a textbook account hack, but he&#x27;s emailed via the formal support channels to no avail so far. If anyone works for Instagram and can help, he (and I) would really appreciate the help as his account dates back to 2012 and of course, the photos aren&#x27;t backed up! Thanks for reading.",
