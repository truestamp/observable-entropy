      "text": "I have an LG G4. It&#x27;s not a fancy phone bit it has more than enough resources for a mobile phone IMO.<p>The problem I have is that many apps consume a lot of resources, to a degree that it gets absolutely ridiculous.<p>The Outlook app for example goes from 150mb to +300mb easy. The IVOOX app also gets in that range, sometimes even more. It happens with many of them, although the ones I use from F Droid tend to be way lower, so I&#x27;m guessing tracking and ADs BS play a role here.<p>So for this reason I must use the android task manager and force close many of this apps if I don&#x27;t want the phone to hang. But many of them keep reopening themselves!<p>It drives me crazy, it&#x27;s just ridiculous.<p>Is this the same on Iphone? Those of you who have android, how do you deal with this? Doesn&#x27;t this problem make you angry? Do I need a high-end phone just for having two f** simple apps opened?",
