      "text": "When starting a startup, there&#x27;s typically a slog time where you got some funding but the startup progress is kind of slow.<p>This time period can be short if you got lucky with your parabolic growth. But often times it could be multi years.<p>How do you shrug the self doubt that tells you: You would have done so much better financially if you just keep your FAANG&#x2F;Unicorn job.<p>Financially, the probability of capturing the upside of making a startup seems small compared to just keeping a day job. I am having a hard time justifying it in my head.<p>Any opinion or suggestion on how to overcome that feeling?",
