And it is because the moon landing.<p>We are very proud to celebrate that day, because we are very, very friendly. Friends to us is everything, we can be noisy, we have the motto to be &quot;too full of himself&quot; and we keep doing the same mistakes. But we are really friendly.<p>And today and thanks to Enrique Fabbraro that was the guy that started today this celebration, it is a day to be with friends. And we need to thanks science too and a lot of people that worked for the Apollo program, because that inspired this celebration. In his own words: “I experienced the moon landing as a gesture of friendship towards the universe and at the same time I told myself that a town of friends would be an unbeatable nation. Then it was decided: 20th of July is the chosen day”<p>So, happy friend&#x27;s day! Happy science and keep the memory of those that inspired other people to be better ones.",

I read this and for me it wasn&#x27;t great but still interesting, so in the end I liked it, at least 10000 times more than &quot;logo and learning&quot; (which I glanced over).<p>I don&#x27;t like the current ranking :(",
