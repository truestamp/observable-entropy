      "text": "More than a week ago my girl&#x27;s blog was terminated. She was kicked out of the session then at login got greeted with the stern message &quot;your account was terminated. You can contact support here&quot;. Or something along the lines. Well, support didn&#x27;t come around answering all these days and she slipped into a reclusive episode, because in her major depression, she believed the blog was her only accomplishment in life. Yeah, the hellsite was known for supporting those in trouble, those lonely, those misunderstood. Until now, at least. On the other hand I&#x27;ve been (on my own tumblr) contacted in the last week by the regular amount of hookers (dozens) and they&#x27;re all fine, spreading their porn and spam, against all the reports I ever did. But no, instead they had to terminate an active account with 9k followers, posting daily for the last three years original street photography and reblogging classical art, flowers and cats. Maybe also Tumblr is going the way of big social media, random automated moderation and zero humanity? The messages I got from other fellow tumblers tell me this was not a singular case, so looking from here and squinting a bit it seems like becoming a warmer home to hookers and crypto spam than to original creators - or to simple people trying to find a little bit of appreciation from strangers. Oh yes, I&#x27;m upset, upset for seeing her thrown out with the garbage, actually rather no, thrown out INSTEAD of the garbage. But is there something one can do to reach some human in Tumblr support? I&#x27;m level zero on Twitter so I tried to reach through engineering - which politely sent me back to support, and support doesn&#x27;t bother replying (yes, I sent reminders). Ironically, when in the past I reported wrong button colors I had answers within two days...",
