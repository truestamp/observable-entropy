      "text": "Progress.org must be one of the oldest sites on the Internet, and quite likely the oldest site that has continuously advocated for economic justice.<p>A few years ago, I took it over and gave it a new facelift (thanks, Webflow!)<p>So today, it’s my great pleasure to announce a next chapter for Progress.org  Earlier today I transferred stewardship of Progress.org into the capable hands of Floyd Marinescu, a man whom I deeply respect and admire. Floyd is a successful entrepreneur and the founder of UBI Works (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ubiworks.ca), Canada’s preeminent basic income advocacy organization.<p>While basic income was the start of Floyd’s journey of economic discovery, his journey didn’t end there, but continued to develop once Floyd discovered the inequities created through our contemporary system of property ownership. His interests have grown to encompass the teachings of JM Keynes, Henry George, and other economic giants. In their spirit, he intends to continue Progress.org’s legacy as a source of information and inspiration on economic and social justice.",
