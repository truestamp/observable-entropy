      "text": "Obviously, whats happening in the Ukraine right now sucks - reading about civilians being killed just leaves me incredibly scared, angry, sad and most of all helpless. It feels hypocritical to me to continue my daily life as before while there is a war going on in Europe. But is there anything that we - &#x27;normal&#x27; people - can&#x2F;should do? Should I donate a part of my income? Any other ideas?<p>Sidenote: I don&#x27;t want to support Ukrainian government but ordinary civilians. Judging from all I know, Russia are the &#x27;bad guys&#x27; but all my information comes from western media so it is likely biased. Thus, I do not want to support any kind of war actions in itself, I rather want to help people that have to suffer from the consequences.",
