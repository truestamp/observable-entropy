      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I tried teaching my daughter coding using Swift Playground as well as Python. I am a university professor but my problem is that I exclusively teach to masters and PhD students and I have no idea about how to teach coding to a child. My daughter liked some of the stuff but I quickly realized that I was unable to make my teaching relatable to her in any manner. It was way too abstract for her and also very boring.<p>It would be great if you could share your experiences and advice on how to go about doing this. I don&#x27;t want to push her lest she starts hating coding (and me!)",
