      "text": "We received this message from Apple appstore a few days ago.\n=================\nWeâ€™re reaching out because either your bank, an intermediary bank, or our banking partner will no longer process payments to the bank account you provided for vendor number XXXXXX. If you need to update your banking details, visit Agreements, Tax, and Banking in App Store Connect.\n============\nApple explicitly refuses to give any info on the reasons of blocking. Needless to say, the bank account is in good standing and was used for like 8 years to get the payouts.<p>I know firsthand that Valve stopped (supposedly, temporarily) payments to Ukraine as well.<p>Did anyone other here (especially Ukrainian devs) received any similar message lately? Managed to resolve the issue?",
