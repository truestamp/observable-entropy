      "text": "Apparently this EtherNet&#x2F;IP protocol is all the rage in the industrial&#x2F;IoT systems world.  But it&#x27;s closed source, requires friendship dues to get into the club and use, and most egregiously it claims to &quot;trademark&quot; Ethernet&#x2F;IP even though there is already an Ethernet IP protocol (as in the Internet Protocol).<p>I&#x27;m curious if this is so great if anybody has looked into making a more standard protocol that doesn&#x27;t require some single-vendor proprietary bizarrely trademarked and confusingly named thing?<p>There is ModBus&#x2F;TCP but it&#x27;s, yikes.<p>Anybody familiar with these things?",
