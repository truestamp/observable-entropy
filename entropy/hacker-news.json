Say we created Omicron light in March of 2020, or soon thereafter, would that have saved lives?",

      "text": "I&#x27;m building a new product service in relatively well established space.<p>I&#x27;m struggling with one decision -- should I launch it but not splash the internets with word about it or should I be open and post it to HN&#x2F;product hunt etc.<p>I know the prevailing wisdom about if there is even a demand for it, so stealth would be foolish. But let me elaborate.<p>This is a 2-sided platform, so yes there&#x27;s the chicken and egg problem. Launching to HN and other forums has the advantage of getting past the hump somewhat quicker but it will also bring it to the notice of more players quickly. I&#x27;m an indie developer and don&#x27;t have a ton of resources to compete if someone moves quicker to launch a similar thing before I&#x27;m ready to take them on.<p>On the other hand, one approach is to selectively reach out to customers and users and grow it that way, at least for a little while. But the downside is that it&#x27;ll take me a lot longer to seed the platform with sufficient demand and supply.<p>How do you weigh such a decision? To be clear, I&#x27;m not trying to protect my special snowflake idea. I&#x27;m just trying to be tactical about what approach makes sense given my resources to move faster than a more well funded platform.",
