I believe that humanity will only survive long-term if we move to an economic system that is antifragile and importantly orients towards reducing rivalries. We should be building protocols that solve problems today and move us in this direction. The key seems to be to change the way we pay for things. I&#x27;m thinking about an open-source approach to all work where customers pay for future developments instead of past work.\n2. I did work on it but got stuck because I wasn&#x27;t confident enough to share it with the world and involve other people. This time around I will push myself to build in public.",

So I thought if I can hand-pick &amp; send one best resource every day, it’ll help product managers not miss anything great.<p>Plus an article a day would be a great way of learning a little each day.\nP.S. At the end of every newsletter there’s a “meme” related to product management to cheer you up!<p>So please shower your support by subscribing to it! Checkout here  (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itsrabbithole.substack.com&#x2F;)",
