      "text": "Hey all! We&#x27;ve been working on this browser extension with a friend for the last three years and we&#x27;ve made a few updates recently, so I figured I&#x27;d post it here :)<p>We&#x27;re building it as an open source and more modern alternative to things like Momentum. There&#x27;s still a ton more we&#x27;d like to do and we&#x27;re looking for constructive criticism or advice, both to improve it and make more people know about it.<p>We&#x27;re really proud of it and hope you like it. Cheers!",

      "text": "Structures like linked list, trie, binary trees, stacks, etc.<p>One approach is to convert them to json and serialize it and save it as a string or binary file. But then if you are dealing with TB of data, or just large amount of data, now your program needs to load the entire thing in ram&#x2F;memory first.<p>So Second approach I think could be like regular databases, on-disk. Are there on-disk data structures? Can you make any data structure to exist on disk.<p>Suppose I have a huge decision tree, terabytes of data. How can I use it without loading the entire thing in memory.",
