      "text": "Hi, hoping to benefit from your collective wisdom and experience here.<p>I need to buy a rack-mountable machine (ideally one) that has at least one decent GPU (A6000 or A100), a good CPU (thinking Epyc or Threadripper) and &gt; 40TB of storage.<p>Usage will be all over the place - medium-sized offline (batched) data processing, deep learning with language and visual models, inference, and live data ingestion. Possibly all at the same time.<p>What should I buy? Budget is 20-40k.<p>I&#x27;m wondering in particular:\n- Is the HBM2 memory on an A100 worth the 2x price over a A6000?\n- Should I go for a tower (such as the Lenovo P620) or a 2U rack? (space and power are irrelevant to me)\n- Are there hidden costs with major suppliers (I really don&#x27;t want to pay $1k for a 4TB dell hdd)\n- Are there any gotchas with report to lights out management? I.e. can I remote reboot a threadripper machine?<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "Based on conversations here, lots of you are upgrading to M1&#x2F;2 MacBooks, even if you had a relatively-recent x86 MacBook. I&#x27;ve been tempted to do the same.<p>But Apple&#x27;s trade-in prices for them are abysmal, and I assume they aren&#x27;t selling well online either (are they?). But they&#x27;re still solid laptops, all things considered, just significantly less awesome than what&#x27;s now available.<p>So: for those who&#x27;ve upgraded, what did you do with your &quot;old&quot; one?",
