      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I’ve been working as a software developer for the last 10 years. Fullstack with a strong tendency to Python in the backend.<p>I’ve never really worked for a company as an employee. All I have done is working as a contractor&#x2F;freelancer or for my own startups (with one semi successfull exit). Currently I’m working for a multi billion dollar company as a contractor, leading a small team of four people.<p>I love programming but I was always interested in the security kind of things (the startup was security related). Is there a good way to transition from software development to security? What are my chances on getting an employment in a large-ish organisation without real job expierence in security?<p>As a contractor, I’m currently making 120k EUR&#x2F;year from Europe (100% remote). Is it realistic to find a remote position paying equally?<p>My current contract will probably run out in around 6 months. I’m currently trying to get a CompTIS Security+ certificate. Does that make sense or can I spend my time better doing something else?",
