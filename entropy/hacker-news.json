I spent 7 years as a software &#x2F; network engineer. However, over the last 3 years I have been pivoting into the lower levels of analog circuits and embedded systems. I have been mentored by Chris Gammell of Analog Life LLC in circuit design and starting my own electronics business; Armatura Electronica. This experience has taught me a lot about what goes into a good circuit analysis, circuit design, circuit troubleshooting, schematic development, PCB layout, and what it takes to be a consultant.",
