But when I play games, I often go for FPS or other, violent games.<p>I wondered why, but it turns out, I am more drawn to the story of these games than anything else.<p>So I wondered if there are more games which have a great gameplay and deep story to keep me engaged and are fun to play which don’t have gun or violence involved.",

Indeed, try this: 1) Launch DrRacket 2) Launch Microsoft Visual Studio 3) Start Task Manager and look at memory consumption.<p>You will get the result as in this picture: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;ZLdTPGB<p>You’ll see that DrRacket consumes an enormous 648MB of memory while you haven’t even done anything in it yet! Visual studio consumes only 240MB (which is still a lot, to be clear, but still significantly less than the pathetic DrRacket).<p>Why is this so???<p>Is this the best argument that the whole Racket thing is failed project, maybe?<p>(Especially, given that the performance was even worse before, but the core team decided to switch to excellent Chez Scheme recently, being unable to produce decent compiler by themselves.)<p>It is especially interesting that the Racket community always says that they are superior, but they are obviously not able to make a more memory efficient editor than, according to them, the poor Visual Studio (which is much more than an editor and has many more functions than DrRacket)!",
