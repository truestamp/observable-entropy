      "text": "Hi, my name is HÃ©ctor, I&#x27;m currently running an agency that I look to transform into a startup. My goal is to help 1,000 smb&#x27;s increase their sales by the end of 2022, currently I&#x27;m at 4 businesses who have grown with my agency. However, the only way in which I can accomplish my goal is by building something that is scalable. Hence the idea for Qusek: The Online Tool that will audit the digital presence of your business in only a few clicks and in less than 24 hrs.\nIf you know any startups or businesses that provide a similar value proposition I&#x27;d appreciate it if you leave their names in the comments. Thank you. I&#x27;ll be posting weekly updates.",
