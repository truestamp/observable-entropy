Utopiops helps you deploy your applications to AWS in a minute, with a built-in CI&#x2F;CD, monitoring and notifications (The very first deployment takes longer than all the other deployments).<p>Utopiops is going to be a replacement for services such as Heroku, Render, Netlify and Vercel.<p>For the first two to three weeks, we&#x27;re planning to give access to 10 users and work closely with them. Depending on the progress we might increase the number.<p>All you need is an AWS account and 30 minutes of time for initial on-boarding.\nThe users will get one year of free access to the service.<p>Please let me know if you&#x27;re interested.",
