What to do today: Change your mindset<p>- You’re not a bottle floating in an ocean at the whim of the wind. Be a buoy\n- It&#x27;s extra important to be a diligent leader today.\n- Don&#x27;t create fear or spread rumors. But do due-diligence on your function to get ahead of things.<p>---<p>2. What to do this week: Do an audit\n  A) Goals: How are you tracking? What&#x27;s best case, most likely, and worst case? Whatever it is, build a plan to get back on track starting now.\n  B) Team: It might be time to kick some of the nice-to-have projects down the road 6 months so you can stay hyper-focused on your goals. Make sure your team knows why they’re essential to the operations of the business - it will help focus.\n  C) Expenses: Cut what you don’t need. In reality, you should consistently be doing anyway. But take this time to re-set.<p>And tally the total… you’ll need it later.<p>---<p>3. What to do this quarter: Take action<p>Don’t get paralyzed by analysis.<p>A small action now is just as meaningful as a large action much later.<p>---<p>There&#x27;s so much more that you could&#x2F;should be doing including...\n   Discussions to have with your team\n Get serious about managing up\n Use your network for any hires\n Questions to ask your boss\n Make diamonds<p>There&#x27;s actually so much of this other stuff I wrote an article to cover it (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercontext.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;modern-manager-community&#x2F;how-managers-should-prepare-for-layoffs)<p>---<p>What&#x27;d we miss?",
