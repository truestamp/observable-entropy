I don&#x27;t know how anyone manage to work full-time for a long period of time at unrewarding jobs that just don&#x27;t matter.<p>People who have really great jobs(not talking about money ofc), how did you find them?<p>People who work 8 hours a day, mostly for a paycheck, how do you cope without wanting to off yourself?",
