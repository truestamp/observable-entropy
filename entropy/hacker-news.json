      "text": "What do people on here think are the best &quot;intermediate-level&quot; tools for teaching kids to code?<p>There are some great beginner-level apps like Box Island, Lightbox and programmable robots. My son loved those, but outgrew them.<p>After that, Swift Playground does a great introduction to coding with actual text. My son loved it, but there isn&#x27;t much to do once you&#x27;ve finished the Learn to Code activities.<p>There is also Scratch, but my son tended to just diddle around with the games rather than learn anything.<p>Then when you get really advanced, you can solve puzzles in Leetcode, and do various coding tutorials that assume you can code pretty well. My son isn&#x27;t ready for that stuff yet.<p>So what is the right stuff for a kid who has outgrown the Learn to Code 1&amp;2 tutorials in Swift Playground, but isn&#x27;t ready for Leetcode? He&#x27;s a kid, so he needs structured exercises he can complete, or otherwise he&#x27;ll just diddle around. And he needs something visual so it&#x27;s entertaining.",
