Introduce Big O notation, introduces concepts in the abstract and show isolated implementations in code.<p>At work I find myself wishing I had some more insight&#x2F;guidance on the following problems:<p>1. Decision making when requirements aren&#x27;t clear or may be subject to change. How do I avoid giving myself problems in the future?<p>2. I don&#x27;t know all the data structures and algorithms off the top of my head. After reasoning about the requirements how do professional developers do research for the implementation?<p>3. How do I make trustworthy measurements? What tools do I use?<p>4. How do I combine multiple structures&#x2F;algorithms to solve the specific domain problem I&#x27;m facing?<p>In short, I&#x27;d appreciate recommendations for resources that focus on using DS&#x2F;Algo knowledge in real work scenarios.",
