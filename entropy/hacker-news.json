      "text": "Hello everyone\n My name is Semih.  I am an 18 year old hacker.  Actually, it would be more accurate to say SCADA&#x2F;ICS and OSINT hacker.  Today I&#x27;m going to talk to you about hacking critical industrial control systems.  When I first started this business, there were not many resources on the internet, so I decided to write this blog.  I want to inspire you by writing an incident that happened to me First of all, I must say that scada hacking is not like other types of hacking.  Thanks to the scada system you hacked, you can sometimes cut off the electricity of a city, and sometimes cause dozens of planes to crash at an airport.\n I was doing bug bounty when I was 16 years old.  I suffered many injustices and did not receive any money.  I wanted to focus on a more serious field.  First, I targeted a sector (health sector).  Then I chose a country and chose India.  The reason they chose India was because they produced thousands of unsafe software.  I then identified a suitable company (www.meddiff.com).  Then I found the ip address of the software the company sells (I won&#x27;t tell you how I found these ip addresses).  I then discovered an incorrect security configuration in the system.  I was able to enter the hospital system by taking advantage of this vulnerability and I was very surprised.  Because I had the citizenship information, phone numbers, loads of connected devices and bank accounts of thousands of patients and doctors.  I discovered 100 more hospitals affected by this vulnerability.  I infiltrated all these hospitals.  Later, I wrote an e-mail to the company that produced this software, but even after 6 months, there was still no progress.  I reported this to the Indian consulate in my country.  They also directed me to the ministry of defense.  I was promised a monetary reward by the company, but they did not. And they closed the gap.\n                                                    If you have more questions about Scada&#x2F;ICS hacking, you can reach me on Instagram.\n  @32smh32",
