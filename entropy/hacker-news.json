      "text": "Personally, I&#x27;m very impressed both as a gamer and a Linux user.<p>Highlights for me include:<p>- Console-like consistency of experience, but PC-like customizability. You can google how a game performs, and it will be that way for you, no unique hardware quirks to consider.<p>- Valve have done some magic with the proton layer. They even fixed a stuttering issue on Elden Ring and Dark Souls 3 that has annoyed me for years on my Modern Desktop. [1]<p>- It&#x27;s Linux! Fromsoft  never integrated steam cloud saves to Dark Souls 3, so I whipped up some bash scripts to sync over SSH.<p>- The community looks to be rallying with projects like emudeck.com.<p>- This thing is an emulation beast, and with 0 configuration, you can emulate pretty much any console up to PS3&#x2F;360, without having to invest time setting it all up.<p>It&#x27;s still very much a beta, early adopter product. Negatives would include bugs and battery life.<p>But Valve are iterating the software so fast, you can see the momentum swinging - this could be something special.<p>As a technical, Linux-enthusiast audience, I am particularly interested in HN&#x27;s own experiences<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=o1HuX2_Hhss",
