      "text": "Hi all,<p>I&#x27;m a penetration tester and I want to create a service using vultr. Where I just want to give the IP address and the port number and it will give me back all the results about the target. For example: Nmap,DNS,shodan,virus total,metadata,possible IP subnets and SSL-testing. Also, one excel spreadsheet with the data.<p>I&#x27;m doing this work repeatedly. And I want to know if other people also do this task repeatedly? So, maybe I can create some service.<p>Sorry, if this question is stupid. This is my first time asking any question here.<p>Please let me know, what you guys think?<p>Thanks in advance.<p>Shazeb",
