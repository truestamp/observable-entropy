      "text": "Hello everyone. I am Kyle Hogeboom, the founder of Summa (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theeducationstartup.com), an education startup making humankind smarter.<p>For you fellow nerds out there, we are making Asimov’s Encyclopedia Galactica real, our very own Encyclopedia Humanum, a summary of human knowledge that we can navigate like a map and learn from in a personalized way. Our goal is to universalize knowledge and personalize learning so anyone can learn everything - because the only way to solve more problems create more culture is to have more ideas in the minds of more people.<p>Right now, we&#x27;re in development mode...and a catch-22. To get seed funding to build the demo product, we need traction, but to get traction, we need a demo product. (I know, I know, what a terribly unique problem in the startup world.) So, we&#x27;re releasing everything but and collecting names of those interested in being the first to try the revolution in education we&#x27;ve been waiting for. Just type in your name and help us launch this thing.<p>Summa is also hiring, so if you&#x27;re interested in what we&#x27;re doing, feel free to reach out through the website. Or, if you have thoughts&#x2F;criticisms, leave them below. In the meantime, keep on learning.<p>Thanks!",

      "text": "I&#x27;m considering making an application that should be very cheap to make and not costly to run, that will be of use to families. Trying to figure out the pricing by looking at similar things. Cost of running the service would be something similar to serving each logged in user a single page customizable message - so probably less network traffic than a simple ToDo app - although we might allow serving of images, embedded youtube videos at some point this would probably not be in the MVP.<p>I was thinking 5 a month, 25 6 months, 45 a year, but considering Netflix base price is not much more than 5 a month and their operating costs will be significantly higher than mine per user I am wondering if it is too much (but also worrying too little a price will make people not willing to pull their wallet out)",
