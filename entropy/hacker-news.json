I&#x27;m at the first year of my studies.\nI&#x27;d like to ask you for advice on how to make the most out of the time during my studies, so that I won&#x27;t have trouble with employment.<p>What are some of the things that would make me stand out from the rest of the potential candidates in the future?\nI&#x27;m partaking in one of the scientific clubs, where our main focus is game development. In my team, I fulfill the role of 3D artist with occasional programming sprinkled in.<p>Should I be focusing on my GitHub portfolio? What ought to be my main focus?",

Nothing fancy — it&#x27;s just one HTML page with a few links. But I like the end result (yes, I&#x27;m 100% biased): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevin.tw<p>Fun technical facts: the page is entirely self-contained (except the favicon). It doesn&#x27;t have any JavaScript at all. And it weighs 35Kb total (52Kb if you include the favicon).",
