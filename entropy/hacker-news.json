Would you be interested in seeing care-plan stats from different practices too?<p>I&#x27;ve been building out an EMR from scratch with a private practice and I was surprised to see doctors sharing care-plans. I&#x27;m thinking of having the ability to share care-plans that don&#x27;t include any patient information (only variables) across practices. Please chime in if you have thoughts about how this might play out!",
