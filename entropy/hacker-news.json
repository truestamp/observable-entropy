      "text": "Can anyone suggest a tool to generate these types of diagrams[0]<p>A parametric communications modeler would be best.  What I mean by that is that it should understand packet length and transmission time and draw the diagram accordingly.<p>I am currently developing a custom communications protocol for an industrial device and need to generate a bunch of these.  At the moment, for lack of a better tool, I am using AutoCAD.  I could use SolidWorks sketches and figure out a way to use equations to make them parametric, but it just won&#x27;t work well to produce these illustrations.<p>The ideal tool would, for example, understand that it takes, say, 1 ms to transmit a byte and 12 ms to transmit a 12 byte packet and, say, 4 ms for the ACK response packet and draw the graph accordingly.  If I redesign the packet and it becomes 10 bytes rather than 12, the graph should update automatically.<p>If I had the time I might create something like this myself, but the most intelligent path is to see if this sort of thing exists.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;C-C-communication-network-timing-diagram_fig10_228713284",
