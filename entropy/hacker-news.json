We are paying to other project&#x2F;task management tools and really want to have them in one place but there are non-technical people in the team. \nI can use both but it will be a challenging to use different tools for different teams and also I can&#x27;t find a reason to use Github for managing projects. What type of companies use github and what are the benefits?",
