      "text": "There exists a lot of high-quality UI component libraries such as MUI, Bootstrap, ANT, Grommet, Chakra, Semantic UI, etc. These components typically map to primitive types:<p><pre><code>    boolean -&gt; checkbox &#x2F; toggle button &#x2F; visibility\n    integer -&gt; numeric input &#x2F; slider\n    enum -&gt; drop down menu &#x2F; radio buttons\n    string -&gt; text field\n    date -&gt; date picker\n    array -&gt; list view\n    matrix -&gt; table view\n    bitmap -&gt; image\n    async promise -&gt; loading indicator\n    side effect -&gt; button\n</code></pre>\nBut what about higher-level types, classes, and schemas? Where can I find UI components that map to a person, a place, an event, a product, a transaction, a movie, an album, a book, an article, or a comment? Shouldn&#x27;t higher-level UI components exist for popular ontologies such as Schema.org? It seems absurd to manually reimplement these templates in every project, yet I can&#x27;t seem to find any comprehensive library of such components.<p>Have I been searching in the wrong place or do such higher-level UI component libraries actually don&#x27;t exist?",
