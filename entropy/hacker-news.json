      "text": "Suggestion: Consider building a &quot;data center satellite&quot;, perhaps in\nsynchronous orbit, that contains a continuous upload of the whole\ninternet (a petabyte fits in a relatively small cube of silicon chips).<p>Add a &quot;local cache&quot; capability to each low earth satellite that holds\nrecently accessed pages. Pages can be marked with Time-to-live\nbefore needing a refresh so relatively static pages (like youtube)\ncan be kept and only highly active pages (e.g. news) can be swapped\n(and cached based on least-recently-used). This is essentially a CDN\n(e.g. an Akamai-like service).<p>The result is a much lower lag time, lower round-trips to Earth, \nand less need for Earth stations.<p>Plus, in the future, they could put such &quot;satellite data centers&quot;\nin orbit around Mars, thus minimizing Mars internet access times\nfor the Mars human data settlements.",
