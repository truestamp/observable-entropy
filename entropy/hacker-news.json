      "text": "I&#x27;m a software engineer, and in my spare time I&#x27;ve built a mac app to help me think[0]. I&#x27;m not a macOS engineer by trade, but the occasional emails I get from users at least lets me know that people use it.<p>I would like to make a small amount of money from it to encourage me to keep building out features and to help offset the (small) costs associated with upkeep. I&#x27;ve hit a few snags when planning a pricing model out:<p>1. I&#x27;d ideally like to make this project open-source because that&#x27;s something I value, but I want to be careful about someone repackaging my code and reselling it. \n2. I&#x27;d like it to be available on the app store.\n3. I&#x27;d like at least some portion of the basic functionality to be free for everyone.\n4. I wouldn&#x27;t ever want to sell user data or monetize via ads, and I&#x27;m not too keen on charging subscriptions for my app (it currently has no cloud-hosted features).<p>Sounds a bit like I&#x27;m trying to have my cake and eat it. What strategies have you used in the past? Has anything worked particularly well? (Feel free to plug your project while you&#x27;re here, too — it&#x27;s always fun to see what people are working on).<p>[0]:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.screenhint.com&#x2F;",
