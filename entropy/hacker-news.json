      "text": "Hello HN!<p>It has been about three years since I launched this current iteration of my Google Sheets add-on called Flookup.<p>I&#x27;m a solo developer and, currently, I handle absolutely everything to do with Flookup from writing code, designing the user interface, replying support emails and even marketing.\nIt is quite a lot of work but very satisfying when I see how helpful it has been to my userbase.<p>Before Flookup, there was only one prominent Google Sheets add-on that could be used for data cleaning (to a certain degree) but, luckily for men, it had left a gap in its functionality that I was very glad to fill.<p>To develop Flookup, I had to write a new algorithm from the ground up in order to make it more useful to my userbase. Originally, this userbase comprised me and a small team at an organisation I was working for but, today, that number has grown to at least 10,000 Daily Active Users all over the world (except Antarctica).<p>What is Flookup? It is an add-on that uses fuzzy matching algorithms to power its data cleaning functions. Flookup&#x27;s functions allow you to match or merge tables without worrying about how uniform your data is. You can also highlight and remove duplicates even if the text contains typos, punctuations marks or spelling differences.<p>So, today, I&#x27;m inviting you to try it out and let me know what you think... here is the link:<p>&gt; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getflookup.com<p>Your free trial is free and unlimited.<p>Thank you; I hope you like it!",

      "text": "I&#x27;m attempting to self-study mathematics, and I&#x27;m having a very hard time with proofs. My formal maths education goes up to calculus II. I&#x27;ve never taken linear algebra, for example, and trying to learn it with a textbook like Linear Algebra Done Right is very difficult. I have a terrible time even making it through the first set of exercises once proofs come into the picture.<p>I&#x27;ve heard many many times that you can only learn math by doing it, which is certainly true, and is akin to saying that you can only learn a language by attempting to speak it. But to begin to learn to speak well, one must hear tons and tons of speech. Similarly, to begin to learn to write well, one must read tons and tons of writings.<p>Are there any resources for people who just want to read proofs? Preferably well-commented ones suited for beginners like myself who are trying more to get a feel for proof as an activity rather than trying to learn any particular branch of mathematics through them (at this point).",
