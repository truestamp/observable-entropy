We have a fully developed and sellable product and even some decent market traction but now need someone to help us recruit and manage an international sales team. We have very little infrastructure in place, very little budget, but a great product and aspirations of global dominance. The ideal candidate will be able to start from scratch and build structure and process around our proposition.<p>Valkyrie Engine (aka We3D) is software that lets anyone make cool 3D&#x2F;AR content.
