But then I realized all the labs around here, end up charging about 15 to $20 per roll if you want them to get developed and scanned.<p>Assuming you shoot a roll of film every single weekend, you end up spending 1k per year to develop it all.<p>Developing at home is not an option ( although I would be open to a magic machine that does it for me ).",
