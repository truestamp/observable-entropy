Found out no one needs it :)<p>Now I am switching to another problem. Many of the people I talked to say that their data storage is a mess. No one updates docs, it&#x27;s hard to find relevevant dataset and onboarding of new analysts takes a ton of time.<p>Do you have some of this problems? How painful are they? Do you think it is possible to automate updating of db docs using AI? (so using schema and field values algorithm will compose a text description on every change).<p>Btw, here is a [link](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datafresh.unicornplatform.page&#x2F;) to a page that a bit illustrates the idea.<p>Thanks for your comments!",
