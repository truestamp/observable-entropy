      "text": "Hey HN,<p>SearchShare is a PoC for sharing verified search engine results between users.<p>It enables a user to submit a copy of the search result they&#x27;ve received from a search engine, in a manner which does not enable the user to tamper or manipulate the results received. In doing so, it enables at trustless relationship between users.<p>Once search results have been submitted, users visit the website to compare results between users, between queries &amp; between search engines.<p>The use case builds upon the concepts of notarisation which enables the creation of signed copies of web pages, which are provably authentic &amp; independently verifiable. Signed pages can not be modified, manipulated or tampered with by the user who created them, or any parties who received them. The signed page is authenticate in that it is represents the web page (web resource, or dom) as requested by the user, and delivered by the server.<p>My first Show HN, appreciate any feedback and keen to see some discussion.<p>Links:\nExample: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchshare.proofs.sh&#x2F;compare&#x2F;6&#x2F;8<p>Site: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;searchshare.proofs.sh&#x2F;<p>Readme: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rjaus&#x2F;search-share-docs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;README.md<p>How to submit your own results: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rjaus&#x2F;search-share-docs&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;How-to-submit.md",
