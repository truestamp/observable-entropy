      "text": "I have working on this startup idea for last 2 months. The idea is to provide encrypted video access using DRM( digital rights management) to enterprises. The encrypted video access to enterprises should be useful for storing all hands videos, individual code walkthrough and other important internal enterprise videos.\nwith DRM, the secured video access can only be granted to individuals who need access to. I know zoom provides this feature. The video is not encrypted. People could download the videos and walk away.<p>Looking for like minded folks, mentors to expand on this idea, discussions.<p>It is always said that donâ€™t assume the problem exists. Always validate a product market fit. I m not sure market exists for encrypted video access for enterprises.",
