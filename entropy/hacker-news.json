However, my development machine is network&#x2F;connection limited so I&#x27;d like to run this on some cloud provisioned platform. What&#x27;s the simplest tool or PaaS that would meet these needs? It doesn&#x27;t have to be the most cost effective, I simply need the ability to run many instances of my wrk script.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wg&#x2F;wrk",
