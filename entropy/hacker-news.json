      "text": "Like most of us here, I&#x27;ve absolutely loved programming since I was a kid. And I did programming. A lot.\nA couple of years ago I joined a PhD program in AI. I liked the science, but I dropped out after realizing I didn&#x27;t really like working that way.<p>Current status: I feel I completely lost any interest in any kind of tech. Programming lost its magic. I can&#x27;t stand the people considering their tech-related opinions as facts. I can&#x27;t stand the childish &quot;here&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like tech X&quot; articles (I guess I&#x27;m doing the same?). I can&#x27;t stand self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot; of the next js framework which will disappear in 2 years. Seems pointless.<p>So how do you renew your interest in tech?",
