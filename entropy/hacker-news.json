      "text": "Technology never stops marching on. What are some job titles, roles, departments that didn&#x27;t exist 10 years ago? Or what roles existed 10 years ago but were not widely known or understood but are now mainstream?<p>Two examples:<p><i>YouTuber</i>: Some people were probably making a full-time income from YouTube 10 years ago, but the role &quot;YouTuber&quot; is much more mainstream and well-known today. Plus, thousands (millions?) of people are now full-time YouTubers covering every interest under the sun.<p><i>Social Media roles</i>: I saw the following job title recently: <i>Head of Brand Engagement and Social Media</i> - which made me wonder if titles liked this existed 10 years ago? Or are they only now mainstream and more common?<p>Note: Although I have listed technology-related roles, are there new roles from the past 10 years not principally about technology?",

      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for something along the lines of &quot;A Tour of Go&quot; [1] or &quot;The Rust Programming Language&quot; [2], but for learning x86 assembly. Searching the Internet for x86 resources turns up a large number of web pages (often for a university&#x27;s operating systems or security course) introducing only the simplest basics. On the other hand, I&#x27;m aware of reference materials such as Agner Fog&#x27;s instruction tables [3], but these are intended for reference, not for acquiring proficiency. One more point to clarify is that I&#x27;m comfortable with assembly in general, but I&#x27;m not well-versed with <i>x86</i> assembly in particular and am thus looking specifically for resources on x86. I would greatly appreciate any pointers!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;tour&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.agner.org&#x2F;optimize&#x2F;instruction_tables.pdf",
