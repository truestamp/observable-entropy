      "text": "I did my bachelors and masters in engineering from a non-English speaking country in Europe.<p>I moved to US after my masters with my partner who works as a SWE. I was unable to find any job in my field of engineering in the Bay Area. I decided to do a second bachelors in CS to have better job prospects.<p>I completed my second bachelors last year but I am struggling a lot to find a beginner level job in tech. I have almost 4 point GPA and a good mathematical and analytical background but I wouldn’t say I am really good at coding. I really want to start somewhere and work hard and make my way up. Currently I am working in data entry making ~60k in Bay Area :(<p>Most job openings require work experience in CS. I have submitted my resume at more than hundred places but didn’t hear back from anyone.<p>I am really disappointed and feel like I will never get a decent job and I wasted my life savings in getting a second bachelor.<p>Any advice to break into tech will be very helpful.<p>Thanks.",
