      "text": "I usually have about 20+ books in my open reading queue at any given time, on various formats and devices, from paperbacks to eBooks and PDFs. There are entire collections I intend to read thoroughly and completely in my lifetime, like the European classics and the Western Canon, and then there are other books which I quickly pick up and discard or peruse for value (like Tyler Cowen&#x27;s method of reading fast)[1].<p>I would like a simple app or workflow to keep track of reading progress across all my books. Maybe academic papers and articles as well. It should offer quick progress percentages at a glance, perhaps even an iOS widget, and be quick to input new books and update reading progress.<p>I&#x27;ve tried the iOS apps &quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;readinglist.app&quot;, &quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leio.co&quot; and Bookly, currently using ReadingList.app and am pretty happy, but would love to hear what you guys are using.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marginalrevolution.com&#x2F;marginalrevolution&#x2F;2006&#x2F;12&#x2F;how_to_read_fas.html",
