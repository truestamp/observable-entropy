      "text": "I have had family members go through the visa process, for both EU (Schengen) and the US and UK.<p>Why is the visa process so archaic? First of all, appointments are submitted via a third-party firm who doesn&#x27;t have any information during or about the process, as in how long will it take or if there are any problems in general.<p>Secondly, you have to submit your passport and have them hold it for the duration of the process.<p>Thirdly, if you want your passport back it is a stressful experience and could sometimes only be if you want to cancel the entire visa process, losing the visa fees.<p>And lastly, it takes way too long during the best of times. Currently it is closer to the worst of times. See #1, where the entire process is very opaque and you don&#x27;t know when you may get your passport back, with or without the visa.<p>Why isn&#x27;t it an electronic process where you submit your documents and credentials online and get called in to an interview if necessary, and why does there need to be an actual physical visa stamp or sticker on the passport rather than an entry in their database so that you can be given entry and stamped on arrival?",
