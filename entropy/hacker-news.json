      "text": "It is super counterproductive and it got so bad I actually switched to Edge this week after being on Chrome literally since day one in September 2008.<p>I still use Chrome for desktop, because open in new tab is still available and also tab groups do make sense on Desktop (e.g group gor music and YouTube tabs, one for research, one for my amazon and ebay tabs etc).<p>But on Android they do not make any s nse at all, on particular how they&#x27;re implemented, forcing me to squint through those tiny stamp sized boxes to see which group is the page I care about.<p>How and why did this ever grt approved? Did the person who approve I use Android on a 50 inch screen or what? Both of my phones (Google&#x27;s very own Pixel 4 and Samsung Galaxy S9) don&#x27;t have screens large to display them properly.<p>At the very least, Google should re-implement the UI to make it usable if thwy insist on having tab groups as the only!!! option available, or just put back the option to open in nww tab outside groups.",
