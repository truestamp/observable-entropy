      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;ve co-founded a consulting company, we&#x27;re growing and I consider it a success, but everyone here wants to move into products more, and not just doing general React coding. Our end goal is either to have our own things that we&#x27;re attached to, or have clients where we can be more involved.<p>So we figured that we will learn more about product lifecycle by releasing whatever we can, and this is our first step: a simple bot that notifies you on Discord whenever something happens on GitHub.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback! Or if you&#x27;ve been on this road before and you have some insight.",
