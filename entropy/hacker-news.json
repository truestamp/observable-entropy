The main one I&#x27;m thinking about is a simple landing page where users can upload multiple spreadsheet files and easily append the data into a single table&#x2F;document (allowing for basic Pandas operations). My concern is that this idea isn&#x27;t very strong, but I really want to build something.<p>Any ideas for simple-ish, useful services I could work on?<p>I&#x27;m building this on my own, so I&#x27;m trying to keep scope manageable.",
