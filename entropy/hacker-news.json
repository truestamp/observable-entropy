      "text": "Hi,<p>I have a bachelors degree in a non-science related field so I have never conducted a research study myself. I find it very difficult to understand if the study I am reading is well thought out, with good practices or just comes from shady interests or publications.<p>How can I be better informed to distinguish between good and valid studies from the others?<p>How do I know if a study has been peer reviewed and what were the conclusions of those reviews?<p>How do I know if the methodology chosen for trials was right or flawed?<p>Is there any &quot;Research Studies for Dummies&quot; resource out there I can read to improve my knowledge on this?<p>Thank you",

      "text": "Quality degradation of search results (on popular search engines) has been a trending topic on HN multiple times. Below are a couple of those discussions:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29392702 \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25538586\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22107823 \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29552322<p>Most of these discussions seem to be concluding on a specific topic - a feedback loop that ad-driven search engines cause, forcing the content creators to optimize for wrong parameters. This business model pushed many creators behind walled gardens, app developers to defend their data at all costs.<p>We all agree that content discoverability was one of the big pain points on the web since its inception (and still is). I don&#x27;t understand why we&#x27;re yet to have a web standard to address this problem. I believe in interoperable search engines as a solution to this problem. Interoperability will force search engine services to employ varying business models based on user needs. This will also free up more information for public discovery.<p>It&#x27;s a problem that popular web standards organizations could solve (worst, should have already been solved). Because nobody is doing it, I&#x27;ve decided to spend some time on it, now doing it much more seriously. \nHere is the entire idea as whitepaper: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Aquila-Network&#x2F;whitepaper&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;AquilaDB_white_paper.pdf \nI&#x27;m looking forwards to your valuable suggestions for improvement.\nThis repo contains the current implementations of it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Aquila-Network<p>NB: it&#x27;s not a shitcoin whitepaper shilling.",
