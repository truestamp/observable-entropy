No concrete plan to use the knowledge on any project, but think it will become more and more important in the next years and want to be prepared to that.<p>What resources can you recommend to get started?<p>Should be self-paced or with max 2h mandatory sync time commitment per week and if possible be less than 100$ per month<p>I am more interested in fundamentals and concepts than a project driven “code along this python project” kinda style.<p>Thanks for your help!",
