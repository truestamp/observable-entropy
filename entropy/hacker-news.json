      "text": "I am not a fan of trading. I look at the fundamentals and buy stocks with the intent to hold for long term. One of the mistakes I make is buy without looking at the technical analysis. This can incur considerable opportunity loss or real loss. So I am planning to apply technical analysis to fundamental analysis. Here is my thought process.<p>1. Shortlist the stocks based on the fundamentals, future potential, moat etc. I will apply technical analysis only to this list. Wont buy anything outside this list, even if the technical analysis says its is a screaming buy.<p>2. I am very bad at technical analysis. But we get the summary verdict (sell&#x2F;buy&#x2F;neutral) based on oscillators and momentum indicators easily in several sites. I will use this as the input. The plan is to use 1 day interval.<p>3. For sell&#x2F;hold decisions, I wont rely on technical analysis verdict. ( Unless there are some fundamental based issues).<p>4. For buy&#x2F;entry decisions, rely on the technical analysis verdict.  This is the toughest part. Because it may not factor in the trend reversal. So we may end up buying at the peak. To overcome this, what are some of the key parameters to give more importance to? ( I mean among the momentum and oscillator parameters used in the verdict, such as moving average, RSI, ADX etc)<p>Can someone help me with the point 4?",
