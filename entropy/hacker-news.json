      "text": "I have gone through different things and back to where I had started. I primarily take notes on widows notepad now. I just dislike mac note taking apps: first there are two native apps. One app tries to be more than just notepad, it&#x27;s whole note management system. And second one preserves formatting and frustrating to get spaces right. Windows notepad does one thing and it does it well. Text Editor that saves a file, fast, clean, simple.<p>I started to use Evernote many years ago, then it started to lag and just suck, switched to MS Onenote, it just didn&#x27;t know how to sync, 8 chapters worth of summaries I had written from reading a book disappeared and that finally made me quit it. Google docs kinda work but has the worst UI for file explorer and too much like MS word and since it&#x27;s not standalone app the tab gets lost among other tabs, where standalone app is easy to switch to visually and through shortcuts.<p>I now just create bunch of text files on desktop: todo, book summary, appointments, etc... and when I&#x27;m done with them I just move them into giant unorganized folder. I have found notes from 7 years ago this way. Sure if there was a native clean app to search through all txt files it&#x27;d be great. But not so bad tbh.",
