And more generally, plenty of people feel that cryptocurrencies are a bubble. \nIf we want to back our intuition fro profit, it would seem we should be able to buy a put option on say Bitcoin. However, it doesn’t seem like such an instrument exists. All methods of shorting cryptocurrencies seem  to involve buying cryptocurrencies with which to buy the option, then taking your profit in cryptocurrencies or tethers.\nWhy can’t we go to an established exchange, buy a put option with say USD, and receive any profits in USD?",
