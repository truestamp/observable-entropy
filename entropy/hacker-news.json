      "text": "So here is some background information for some context:\n- Am 25 yrs of age\n- I live in a developing country(if that matters)\n- I finished my studies in 2020 but graduated with a degree in computer technology in 2021 due to Covid\n- But I started developing real world applications in 2018, due to financial issues. The freelance contracts\n I got around that time, helped alleviate my financial woes including paying for my fees.\n- Got my first permanent software job at a remote startup in a developed country in 2019 and \nbeen working there ever since as one of the founding developers.<p>But now I have been interested in getting another job for some time due to a some issues affecting me in \nthe current company:\n- Working on some weekends, frequency increased in the past 8 months\n- The boss claims he will give me a weekday replacing the weekends worked but most of them are not\n replaced(giving an impression am working for free)\n- Occasionally, there is always a deadline leading to working 12 hours+ to meet it\n- The long working hours and weekends got so bad that I got burnt out and tried to quit a few months ago,\nbut boss told me he will replace them but the bad patterns have already emerged again \n- Changes in some of the clauses in the contract or per what we agreed without letting me before hand.\n- I suggest we follow best practices but the boss is more focused on how many features we can develop, \ntasks we can do.<p>I have applied to a couple of jobs(on and off) in that span of time and although I was able to get \nthem to have a call with me or get tested for my skills, I often failed the technical \nassessments due to lack of enough preparation(since most of the time am working and rest when I am free)\nAlso I see most jobs either requires to have experience in distributed systems(which I have no professional experience)\nand use industry standards to write software(which we never followed). This makes me feel like I need to learn\neven more things in order for those companies to see I am experienced and its not just fluff.<p>The current job limits my time but I want to grind hard on various technical questions so\nthat I can be considered for any role and at least reach the offer stages. I also have 4 months reserves\nto sustain my current lifestyle. I also heard you are more likely to get a job while you are on a job.\nNow comes my question, should I quit my current job then I practice for interviews to increase my chances of\nfind a better job?<p>Also any help on how to prepare for interviews and crafting a very attractive resume would be appreciated. Thanks!",
