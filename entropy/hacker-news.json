      "text": "I&#x27;m having a Flutter app running both on iOS and Android.<p>Currently, review time of Apple App Store, Samsung Galaxy Store and Huawei AppGallery is about 1-3 days which is not great but tolerable. However, review time in Google Play is a notable 4-10 days.<p>Google&#x27;s review time does make bugfixing quite impossible to deal with.<p>Especially, GUIs are often impossible to test exhaustively. The obvious solution is continuous delivery which fixes issues identified by users in a timely manner. Unfortunately, app store reviews are leading to the worst deployment experience possible.<p>How are you dealing with this problem?<p>IMO, there should be a possibility to submit bugfixes immediately. That is, releases with increased patch number according to SemVer should be approved immediately.<p>Sure, app store providers won&#x27;t do this because it will definitely be exploited.<p>There has to be another way. I find continuous delivery to be one of the most powerful weapons of a developer, and it is just not possible in the app store ecosystem.",
