      "text": "General advice that I have recieved says you should take breaks every 30 mins, especially if the work involves being seated at one place. This also works well with the Promodoro technique. But 30 mins would definitely not cut it for tasks that need prolonged focus. I have also noticed people suggesting taking breaks 90 mins. I wonder what&#x27;s the optimum frequency of breaks.",
