      "text": "Hello HN. A while ago I came across a post here that showcased a really neat FOSS project which I am very certain was made and open sourced by the uk government.<p>It a was a web based app that included a very extensive collection of data tools such as data converters (i.e. json-&gt;csv), currency converters, hashing data and back and all sorts of other types of tools like that... it was very similar to 123apps.com but also leagues ahead of it.<p>I can&#x27;t for the life of me remember what it was called and searching for it hasn&#x27;t yielded anything useful. All I associate with it is the gov.uk website and their github page... But the problem is I couldn&#x27;t find it on there either, so it could very well be a false association but I am not entirely sure.<p>I know this is an extremely long shot given how little I remember about the project, so I really appreciate anyone who tries to help me find it.<p>Thank you.",
