I am guessing there are brokers for this stuff out there. Are there any that are higher quality than others?<p>Problem 2: Who do I contract to do the printing and mailing? Maybe 1+2 have the same solution&#x2F;vendor.<p>My basic goal is to mail a postcard (or possibly a modest piece of schwag) with a coupon&#x2F;incentive to try our product.<p>I&#x27;d love any related anecdata on experiences with offline marketing from smaller &#x2F; indie devs!",
