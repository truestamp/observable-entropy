      "text": "Hello Everyone,<p>Docker announced its new feature called Docker Extensions(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;). \nSo we can directly use tools in Docker Desktop with one-click installation of extensions. Since it&#x27;s in Beta, there are limited tools in the marketplace and we are lucky to say that ddosify(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ddosify&#x2F;ddosify) is one of them. With Ddosify Docker Extension, you can easily perform load test to your endpoints.<p>Here is a quick how-to video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W3r8GIgLLKU<p>Note: Min. Docker Desktop version is: 4.10.0<p>Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;new-extensions-improved-logs-and-more-in-docker-desktop-4-10&#x2F;",
