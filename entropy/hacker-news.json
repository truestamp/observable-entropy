We are in touch with a dozen of central banks, and currently nearing a pilot.<p>We&#x27;re looking for crypto researchers&#x2F;teams&#x2F;firms that can do a thirdparty security audit of our crypto protocols. We use Signal&#x27;s Ratchet for Key Negotiation, but our Unique Key Generation is somewhat more complicated and nonstandard.<p>If you think you could help, or know someone that can please contact me at andrey (dot) kocevski (at) WhisperCash.com<p>Or if you have any tips of how to find these folks, please comment below. Cheers!",
