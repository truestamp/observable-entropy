      "text": "A long time ago I worked as a software consultant&#x2F;contractor in the US, and I&#x27;m thinking of doing it again.  I mostly enjoyed it but the &quot;find your next client&quot; part was really stressful.  Of course, there&#x27;s another big industry in which talent always has to find projects and vice-versa, and that&#x27;s the film (and television) industry... in which there are Agents whose job it is to do that matching for a 10% share of the deal.<p>But when I look around I don&#x27;t see that happening in software.  I know some people tried, but I don&#x27;t think it got anywhere.  Instead I still see &quot;consulting companies&quot; that have employees, and &quot;independent contractors&quot; that have to constantly worry about their next gig.  For people who want to be independent contractors, but don&#x27;t want to do the whole networking-for-jobs thing, it seems like Hollywood-style agents would be the perfect solution.<p>Why isn&#x27;t the software agent a thing, even a dominant thing, in our industry?",
