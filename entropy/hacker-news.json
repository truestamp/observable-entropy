      "text": "Hello.<p>This year I dived into UI&#x2F;UX area and at the same time I work as a web developer. I sincerely love making good UI. But at my full time job it&#x27;s not always possible due to different reasons =\\<p>So I&#x27;ve been posting random UI&#x2F;UX staff on Twitter, then I made a free book that had 50 tips (posted it here as well).<p>I decided to finish this year by collecting everything I learned and here it is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akcium.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;ui-ux-tips.<p>This time it&#x27;s a paid one. But, you can check ~20 pages of it, just go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akcium.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;ui-ux-tips-sample, put 0 in the price and download it for free.<p>I tried to illustrate almost every tip and provide some additional links.<p>This is especially useful for devs and founders who cannot afford a designer or just want to make their UI look decent.",

      "text": "A while a go I needed to use a GPU enabled computer to run some deep-learning models. I used AWS (naturally) and all was good except the price and performance was not great. I then had to use more GPU compute and didn&#x27;t want to use AWS or GCP. I also didn&#x27;t need the latest and greatest GPU specs. I found a solution that is affordable and with good performance. I am now thinking there might be other people with a need for GPU compute but not at AWS prices. People who dont have the skills to build the hw&#x2F;sw set up but do need machine learning compute capabilities. Over to you HN? Does this resonate with anyone?",
