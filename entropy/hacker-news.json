There seems to be a plethora of books on climate and energy out there and every blog recommends a completely different list. As I&#x27;m not that familiar with the topic, I&#x27;m ideally looking for a book that gives an overview of the different types of energy and their practicality.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, \nI was wondering if anyone would be interested in trying out a project I have been working on for the past 2,5 years (www.mealsafari.com). I haven&#x27;t opened registration to the public just yet so if you want to try the logged in features, just send me a quick message through the contact form on the site with an emailaddress and a preferred username and I&#x27;ll set up an account for you.<p>Feel free to use a throwaway email, for now you just need access to it for the activation link and password resets.<p>Pain points I am trying to address:\n- Not having to scroll through miles of life stories before getting to the recipe contents\n- Easy alteration of recipes&#x2F;menus from other users to suit your own likes (say you don&#x27;t like an ingredient in a recipe, you can use that recipe as a base to create a variation)\n- Easy creation of meal plans by using your own and others&#x27; recipes and menus as building blocks\n- Minimal to none dark patterns and annoying popups&#x2F;surveys&#x2F;newsletters<p>Background: Initially I was going to make a small website (which quite frankly could have been an excel sheet) to store my moms collection of recipes. The idea was to be able to randomly select a recipe when we just couldn&#x27;t decide what to cook. I guess my curiosity got the better of me and it ended up being one of my bigger projects so far, learning tons about IT infrastructure, devops and web development (mainly Drupal).<p>I would be more than happy for any feedback!",
