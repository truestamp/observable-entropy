      "text": "Hi HN - Here’s a question that I hope will generate some useful comments, suggestions and links.<p>Background for question: I normally run an internal DNS resolver with an upstream pool of 10-15 providers. These are normally a mix of Global Anycast servers (Quad9 etc) with some OpenNIC, YandexDNS etc thrown in towards the end to cover the ‘chilling effects’ blackholes.<p>Currently Yandex DNS is pinging out (either due to black-holing or DDOS’ing depending on where I connect To&#x2F;From).<p>My question to HN is this – Given my ‘Information Wants To Be Free’ viewpoint, are there any DNS equivalents of Switzerland (WWII, Neutral to all parties) providers?",

      "text": "Do you remember Twitter breaking hundred of thousands of application because of abrupt API toS change? Facebook breaking APIs without notice? Google changing Google Maps API freemium pricing killing thousands of map integrations? Linkedin killing API access to startup competing with them? If developers had read carefully API Term of Service, they would have known the danger.<p>Can I use this API safely in the long term is a difficult question to answer in the Digital world we live in. Most of the time, developers discover that their API access has been revoked when users complain their app does not work anymore.<p>On https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apitos.org&#x2F; we intend to build a framework making API Terms of service easily shareable and understandable, under the form of a creative commons pattern composed by simple logos and warnings. A quick survey is at your disposal to collect more feedback.  Open to debate about what is important for developers and ideas&#x2F;Feedback welcome!",
