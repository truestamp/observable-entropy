      "text": "Hi all, I recently reworked the website for my book &quot;Clean Architectures in Python&quot;, which is now available at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedigitalcatbooks.com, where I plan to host other upcoming books.<p>The book was published in 2018 (see the announcement here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18775349) and in 2020 I published the second edition. You can find the PDF on Leanpub at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanpub.com&#x2F;clean-architectures-in-python.<p>Both the book and the website required a good amount of time to be created, so I would be very grateful if you could share the links on social media. Thanks!",
