      "text": "In 2022 it frustrates the hell out of me that on any Android phone I &#x2F;may&#x2F; get apps I expect to be on the phone from the manufacturer, not as part of &quot;stock Android&quot;.  I love my Galaxy Z Fold 2, but I hate that walking through instructions with family members my &quot;Settings&quot; app looks different from theirs.  Even the Calculator is different.  It surprises me that in 2022, during this pandemic, I can&#x27;t plug in my EXPENSIVE Android phone and use it as a high quality webcam for the computer.<p>Is there a reason Google avoids setting a baseline and having stock apps in Android?  Most of their apps are just portals to their services.  I feel as though the experience of Android is diminished because it&#x27;s missing these bare necessities.<p>When I try to look for a forum to request a feature, it says to go navigate into Settings to About phone and then Submit feedback.  Catch-22:  My Settings on this Samsung phone looks different, and there is no Submit feedback.<p>Does Google have some kind of non-compete with app developers and avoids creating these basic apps?  I am nonplussed.",
