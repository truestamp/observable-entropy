      "text": "Each monitor I have (a Dell and a Samsung) require a carefully choreographed dance involving a procession of plugging and unplugging, switching things off and on and various experimental sequences to get everything up and running each morning. I have resorted to using a power board with individual switches to turn monitors off and then on again. This seems to be the only thing that works effectively.<p>It&#x27;s suboptimal.<p>I would rather some monitors that simply woke up from sleep when my 2020 MBP wakes up. This can happen multiple times per day and I have resorted to using Caffeinated during the day to keep everything switched on. During the day it&#x27;s not always as bad as first thing (deep sleep?), but it&#x27;s slow and clunky.<p>Look, I would love a Mac Studio Display but I have no idea if it works this way... I&#x27;ve been so badly burned!<p>I&#x27;m not willing to part with $2500 AUD to make it happen too.<p>Any ideas? What experiences has the HN crowd had with monitors on the Mac of late?",
