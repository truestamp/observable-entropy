      "text": "The workplace policy has been in effect for many years, and was until recently an advertised perk of working for Slack. It allowed all employees access to free paid time off from 24th until the New Year (some employees like incident responders would take shifts, but even Customer Experience (their support team) ran skeleton shifts). Today they have announced this policy has ended as a result of the economy as well as making the workplace more equitable (as Salesforce employees could not access this benefit).",

      "text": "There are many articles about efforts to prevent the discovery of abortions in states where they are illegal. When I read them, I wonder why writers think it is possible to remain anonymous in 2022. The attack surface seems wildly large:<p>- Phone geolocation<p>- Payments<p>- Text messages<p>- Web history<p>- Public security cameras<p>- Biological tests to determine past pregnancy<p>Some specific pitfalls:<p>1. How does one secure one&#x27;s browsing history? One need take many, many steps these days, and even then, it is rarely secure.<p>2. How is one to complete a payment online anonymously?<p>3. Do parcel shipping companies intend to resist court orders mandating disclosure of sender&#x2F;recipient addresses (&quot;outside the envelope&quot;)?<p>4. How does one travel on a US highway without leaving a record via security cameras?<p>There are better and worse security practices, but I don&#x27;t see how a truly determined adversary can fail to discover abortions. And the attacker seems determined.<p>It suggests the only way to make abortions undiscoverable is to completely rethink our privacy regime.",
