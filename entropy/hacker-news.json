But they don&#x27;t realize that they are breaking their own constraints given in the problem.<p>Is there anyway to prove them wrong? I asked to sign an NDA because I&#x27;m genuinely just curious about how to better my understanding if I am wrong, but I&#x27;m getting the feeling they are intentionally not wanting to admit they are wrong.<p>Is there any thing I can do to actually get a response that shows how I am wrong or seek remedy ?",
