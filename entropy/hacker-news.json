How do I get out? \nShould I <i>be</i> in a bubble to keep my sanity? \nHow do I build those filters?<p>Please let me know your thoughts and how you&#x27;re handling it.<p>Things that are making me lose hope:<p>- climate change or how society&#x2F;corporations&#x2F;governments are destroying the environment and&#x2F;or are barely doing anything. All I think about sometimes is how we&#x27;ll begin to see famines spreading across poor countries until it&#x27;s all too late... Yet Elon buying Twitter is still in the news till this day.<p>- social inequality is rising year on year. inflation is a killer for poor families that are barely making ends meet. Yet most corporations are announcing lots of profits and they barely give a sh*t about their workers.<p>- workers: all I hear is there&#x27;s a shortage of workers. shortage, shortage, shortage. But they rarely talk about salaries and wages being so low.<p>- billionaires: ugh, enough about these megalomaniacs.<p>- media: it&#x27;s feeding people rubbish all the time. All. The. Time.<p>- corruption: it&#x27;s so wide spread, people have become desensitized. war... famines... I could go on...",
