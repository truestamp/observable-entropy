      "text": "I’m a straight guy in his late 20s living in the bay, and have been basically since college, so I dont have a ton of context on what its like to date outside of this area as an adult.<p>I’ve noticed on dating apps, it takes maybe 10s to 100s of swipes&#x2F;likes&#x2F;what have you to match with a few people, and many of those people are generally flakey and disinterested.<p>Once texting I’d say maybe 50 percent of people I’m chatting with flake, citing the same 2 or 3 excuses (unless food poisoning is secretly at epidemic proportions here in the bay, or people are constantly forgetting their relatives&#x2F;friends are coming into town for the weekend. More recently COVID is cited as a more valid if not slightly suspect example)<p>Despite the above, I’ve always eventually managed to find great dates, and even build deep relationships, but it just feels like a ton of extra work from what should be a theoretical “normal”.<p>Anecdotally, I’ve heard from various unrelated friends who left the bay that dating in other places is “way better”, people try harder, the “ratio is better” etc.<p>Is dating actually better in other cities for single straight guys in their 20s&#x2F;30s? _Why_ is it better? Help me understand what the difference is<p>The Bay Area is my only context for a baseline so its really hard to get a feel for what other places could be like.",
