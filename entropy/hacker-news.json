      "text": "Many of us might be surprised to know that we can also access docker engine through REST APIs.\nIn this post I will show you how easily you can expose these APIs and start interacting through your favourite POSTMAN or cURL tools.  At the same time, you would also realise how risky it would be to leave them unsecured while giving public access to it.\nAny hacker can easily grab the access and can perform search, add and delete operations on your images which can damage the reputation of the organisation as well as business loss. \nI have used free pen test tool(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apisec-inc.github.io&#x2F;pentest&#x2F;)to scan and find 18 vulnerabilities for the docker API.<p>How to expose Docker REST APIs?\nPre-Requisite:\n∙       An Ubuntu installed on one of VM instances\n∙       Docker installed\nOnce you have installed pre-requisite softwares, create a directory (docker.service.d) and a file(options.conf) as given below and add the content to options.conf file.\nCreate the directory to store the configuration file.\nsudo mkdir -p &#x2F;etc&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;system&#x2F;docker.service.d\nCreate a new file to store the daemon options.\nsudo nano &#x2F;etc&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;system&#x2F;docker.service.d&#x2F;options.conf\nI have used a nano editor but you are free to use any editor of your choice.\nNow update options.conf file with the content given below.\n[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;dockerd -H unix:&#x2F;&#x2F; -H tcp:&#x2F;&#x2F;0.0.0.0:2375\nNow, reload the systemd daemon and restart the docker service:\n# Reload the systemd daemon.\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload\n# Restart Docker.\nsudo systemctl restart docker\nAccess the REST API Endpoint to confirm the configurations we have done are correct.\nEg:\nGET https:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:2375&#x2F;images&#x2F;json\nThe above command would list out all the docker images. We can also try to delete images and can perform many more operations.\nTo get full list of endpoints, please refer to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;engine&#x2F;api&#x2F;\nPlease like and comment to share your thoughts.",
