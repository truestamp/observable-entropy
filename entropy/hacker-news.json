      "text": "Hackernews turned me onto a new bare metal hosting provider. (Thanks - great tip.) The default box comes with four Ethernet devices (2 Mellanox and 2 Intel cards). Two of them are bonded. It has a IPV6 local address; I don&#x27;t about that either. All IPV4 is fine.<p>My goal:<p>* How can I reconfigure these four cards so that I still have a public IP, and a local (internal) IP but such that I can free up both of the mellanox cards or both of the Intel devices so I can use them for DPDK development?<p>I have no need for any high speed public connections. ssh is fine.<p>I&#x27;ve figured this out in Amazon EC2, however, the default NIC situation comes to me simpler than this. I&#x27;m just don&#x27;t have any serious know-how in this particular kind of Linux-admin. And I&#x27;ve never bonded or unbounded a pair of NICs.<p>Details follow.<p>TIA<p>===================================<p>user@defaulthost:~# ifconfig -a\nbond0: flags=5187&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MASTER,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500\n        inet &lt;public-IP-address&gt; netmask 255.255.255.254  broadcast 255.255.255.255\n        inet6 xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxx::1  prefixlen 127  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;\n        inet6 xxxx::xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;\n        ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)<p>bond0:0: flags=5187&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MASTER,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500\n        inet &lt;local-IP-address&gt;  netmask 255.255.255.254  broadcast 255.255.255.255\n        ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)<p>eno1: flags=4098&lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500\n        ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)<p>eno2: flags=4098&lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500\n        ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)<p>enp2s0f0: flags=6211&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SLAVE,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500\n        ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)<p>enp2s0f1: flags=6211&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SLAVE,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500\n        ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)<p>lo: flags=73&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING&gt;  mtu 65536\n        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0\n        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10&lt;host&gt;<p>=================<p>user@defaulthost:~# dmesg | grep enp2\n[    6.331694] mlx5_core 0000:02:00.0 enp2s0f0np0: renamed from eth0\n[    6.372339] mlx5_core 0000:02:00.1 enp2s0f1np1: renamed from eth1\n[    9.429331] mlx5_core 0000:02:00.0 enp2s0f0: renamed from enp2s0f0np0\n[    9.484863] mlx5_core 0000:02:00.1 enp2s0f1: renamed from enp2s0f1np1\n[   11.548785] mlx5_core 0000:02:00.0 enp2s0f0: Link up\n[   11.553936] bond0: (slave enp2s0f0): Enslaving as a backup interface with an up link\n[   11.609695] bond0: (slave enp2s0f0): link status definitely up, 10000 Mbps full duplex\n[   15.421901] mlx5_core 0000:02:00.1 enp2s0f1: Link up\n[   15.429399] bond0: (slave enp2s0f1): Enslaving as a backup interface with an up link\n[   15.678759] bond0: (slave enp2s0f1): link status definitely up, 10000 Mbps full duplex\nuser@defaulthost:~# dmesg | grep eno\n[    2.036278] ACPI: Added _OSI(Linux-Lenovo-NV-HDMI-Audio)\n[    5.178678] igb 0000:04:00.0 eno1: renamed from eth0\n[    5.285816] igb 0000:05:00.0 eno2: renamed from eth1<p>==================<p>user@defaulthost:~# lspci | grep Eth\n02:00.0 Ethernet controller: Mellanox Technologies MT27710 Family [ConnectX-4 Lx]\n02:00.1 Ethernet controller: Mellanox Technologies MT27710 Family [ConnectX-4 Lx]\n04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation I210 Gigabit Network Connection (rev 03)\n05:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation I210 Gigabit Network Connection (rev 03)",
