      "text": "This would be my (possibly wrong) explanation:<p>So in Linux we have syscalls such as write, read, close, socket, ...\nThese syscalls are defined according to the POSIX standard. POSIX is basically a standard for operating systems. Linux&#x2F;Unix follow these standards.\nSo syscalls are an interface so that we can communicate with the OS. (Is it the application binary interface already?)<p>Now, we have the C standard library, so we don&#x27;t need to deal with syscalls (or specific OS stuff). The C standard library is basically an application programming interface (API).\nSo printf, fopen etc. map to write, open, etc. respectively:<p>printf ~ write<p>fopen ~ open<p>fclose ~ close<p>...<p>Then, apparently, we require a runtime environment (RTE). This runtime environment (is perhaps) the standard library that is a .so file (a shared object).\nShared objects are (perhaps) loaded by the OS to a specific memory location so that all C programs can access that .so file (which is now loaded in memory for all C executables to use.)\nSo that .so file is the &quot;RTE&quot; and the syscalls are the &quot;ABI&quot;?<p>If so, I find &quot;ABI&quot; and &quot;RTE&quot; confusing. Java has an RTE. You need the Java Virtual Machine (an abstract CPU essentially) to run your .class files within that virtual machine (JVM).<p>Again, I am unsure about this, so please go easy on me. Thank you!<p>PS: Why do people like Jason Turner say: &quot;break the ABI to save C++&quot;? So break the .so files for C++&#x27;s standard library? What for? (Shouldn&#x27;t it be: &quot;break C++&#x27;s RTE&quot;?)",
