      "text": "I am an average engineer. I am not extremely bright nor I am technically gifted. I am just your bang average IT person, but For the last two-three years, I seem to have been failing upwards in my career without any reason.<p>I know my basic way around servers. I can write simple python scripts. I can google my way around the problems but that is the end of my wits. The only redeeming quality that I have is that I get well along with everyone. I am seeing my peers writing amazing scripts and doing exceptional jobs but for some reason, I am the one who is getting promoted and getting raises instead of them. Everywhere around me I see people vastly more competent in what they do. And I&#x27;m pretty sure to them it&#x27;s obvious I&#x27;m just copying what they do but worse.<p>Now I have started getting calls from Fortune 100 companies for management positions and I am not sure I would ever survive there. I don&#x27;t know what to do here.<p>Has any of you ever experienced this?",
