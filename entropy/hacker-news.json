Trolling about Cryto.<p>Maybe Twitter could be a vehicle for promoting&#x2F;implementing a new coin or FinTech. Musk isn&#x27;t stupid and neither are the backers of the 44 billion in loans.  It seems ludicrous to me that he would be able to do this without a serious plan to increase the value of the investment. Having guarantied access as some have suggested just isn&#x27;t enough.
