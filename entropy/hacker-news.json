      "text": "Did anybody found a good iPad alternative that can natively run VSCode.<p>I am using VSCode to remotely develop on my WSL so I only need to run the frontend. I saw some open-source efforts to run it as web app (which would allow running it on iPad) but I do not think they are ready yet.<p>I am looking for:\n- 11&#x27;+ screen with the quality (resolution&#x2F;brightness&#x2F;etc) comparable to iPad Pro\n- No keyboard or collapsable keyboard (I want to be able to use it as iPad to watch Netflix in bed and such). I assume all OSes now support wireless keyboards.\n- Officially supported OS for VSCode (Windows&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;Mac). Looks like ChromeOS is also supported now.<p>Am I asking for too much?",
