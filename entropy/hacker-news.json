User data also goes to law enforcement agencies in the USA, as a current case shows.<p>The proceedings concern threats against, among others, the well-known immunologist Anthony Fauci. In a series of emails, the sender threatened, among other things, to kill Fauci and his family.<p>As the U.S. Department of Justice writes, the defendant used &quot;an email account from a provider of secure, encrypted email services based in Switzerland.&quot;<p>According to the corresponding affidavit, this email service was ProtonMail. The relevant emails end accordingly with &quot;Sent with ProtonMail Secure Email&quot;.<p>On the basis of data from ProtonMail, which was sent to the USA by way of legal assistance, it emerged that the defendant had used several user accounts at ProtonMail.<p>According to his own statements, the accused had switched to ProtonMail because he believed he was protected by Swiss data protection law and end-to-end encryption. Nevertheless, the sender could be identified in the interaction of data from ProtonMail as well as other online services.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steigerlegal.ch&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;02&#x2F;protonmail-daten-usa&#x2F;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;usao-md&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;file&#x2F;1416926&#x2F;download",
