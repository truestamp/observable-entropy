      "text": "I am a full stack TypeScript dev looking to broaden my skill set by learning a new language. I’ve been weighing Rust vs Go for a long time but can’t really decide which would be a better use of my time. I often hear that people who try one of these languages after coming from something like TypeScript feel that they really level up their abilities&#x2F;understanding.<p>I’d like to learn whichever language will make me a “better” coder in the long term. My understanding is that Rust would be the way to go here. However, I see that the Rust learning curve is significantly higher than Go’s, and that something like setting up a server in rust will take much longer than Go. It sounds like Go is better for “getting things done” but I’m wondering if I’m leaving growth&#x2F;understanding on the table by going from one garbage collected language to another.<p>I am interested in hearing anyone’s thoughts on this matter. Especially if you have experience going from js&#x2F;ts to one of these.<p>Thanks and happy 4th",
