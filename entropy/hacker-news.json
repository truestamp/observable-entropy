Author here :)<p>I&#x27;ve finished upgrading the Hacker News reading app that I made sometime earlier.<p>Among previous features, I added some new ones - which include:<p>- the ability to bookmark any story or comment, which you can read later, and   the newly added comments are highlighted (the ones you did not see or read earlier);<p>- the ability to search through comments, and find the one that you are interested in;<p>- the ability to reply to comments (but you must be logged in at original news.ycombinator.com website to do so).<p>The app is using offical HN API to get the data, and it&#x27;s client side rendered.<p>The technologies used for making this web app are: React (Router, Redux) and vanilla CSS.\nLet me know what you think about the app in the comments.<p>Thanks!",
