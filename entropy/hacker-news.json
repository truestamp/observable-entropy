      "text": "<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hagrid.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hagrid.io</a> - Need to signup for a free trial to use the product (does not need a credit card or any payment).<p>For the past few months, we have been building hagrid, a no-code social QnA widget, that lets you add an interactive FAQ section to any webpage in 10 minutes!<p>Visitors can ask questions, and we (the website owners) can respond. The questions and answers are public; unlike customer-support e-mails and chat, which are lost for ever, and born again every day.  \nSo you get two big advantages: 1. Social proof &amp; the resulting trust - see and hear other people “in the room”\n2. A living breathing FAQ section - populated by your users  We’ve heard a lot from our users and have built out these amazing features for version 2.0:\n1. Seed your own FAQ, order questions anyway you like, filter by page\n2. Automatic zero-effort SEO - feed your QnA to Google FAQ schema\n3. Rich editing, automatic embedding of Youtube Videos and Tweets\n4. Customise, to the pixel, match brand colours, fonts and identity<p>And also users are authenticated, they &quot;log in&quot; to post so:\n* No SPAM! \n* Reach the users even after they have left the website<p>Visitors can post questions anonymously, and website owners do not have access to user details, other than the public username (not even that if you are anonymous). Visitors “log in” (with Social OAuth) to hagrid only. hagrid protects user privacy and anonymity, while letting website owners respond and reach visitors.<p>You can integrate with just about any platform, including Webflow, Wordpress, Shopify, your React Site or just with plain JS on the page. We use hagrid too. Head to hagrid.io and ask us anything!\n--\nVinod",
