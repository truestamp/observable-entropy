      "text": "Yesterday there was an interesting posting about &#x27;Things you&#x27;re allowed to do&#x27;: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31705542<p>One point was that you can use personal assistant services.<p>A few weeks ago I actually signed up for virtual personal assistant  (VPA) service because I had a specific problem: I needed to book an appointment through a company that had very long telephone queues, and they were only operating during my work hours were meetings would interfere with me sitting in the phone queue. I tasked an assistant to sit in the phone queue and book an appointment for me.<p>It worked out great! After just a day I got a message back from the VPA that they had booked me at a time when I had availability!<p>It felt like a huge load off my back to just have it done, after having tried several times and not managing to get through the queue before I needed to head for a work meeting.<p>After this, I&#x27;m excited about using the VPA to simplify my life even further.<p>However, I&#x27;m not sure what I can use it for. It seems really convenient for organizing travel, but I don&#x27;t have any travel planned.<p>Do people of HN have experience simplifying their lives with virtual personal assistants?<p>What kind of things have you used virtual personal assistants for?<p>Have you tried integrating it in you jobs? I would love to use it for things such as booking meeting rooms at work, etc. But I think secrecy in our company (it&#x27;s a biotech) would prevent this.",

      "text": "So I&#x27;ll put it simply, I&#x27;m currently doing Bsc Computer Science, and entering my third year, going through the courses I have, I&#x27;ve realised I haven&#x27;t been learning anything of substance, that I can put on a CV or actually work further on. Just snippets of concepts and coding, along with other irrelevant courses. I am passionate about my field and want to learn more. I don&#x27;t know where to start what to look in, but I just want to be an expert in my field and not clueless. I&#x27;ve recently started web development, html,css,js,nodejs etc and will be learning more on that but other than that I don&#x27;t know what else to do. Ideally I just want to be up-to-date on what the CS world is going to demand by the time I graduate and hopefully even do stuff&#x2F;projects before my graduation so I can write it on my CV. What are the things I need to learn&#x2F;do outside of my degree?",
