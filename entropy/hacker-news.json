      "text": "Aside from a quadratic formula program written on my TI-84 in high school, I did not do any real programming before I was 19, when I learned C because I consciously decided I wanted to learn a new skill. I read stories of learning on a ZX-Spectrum at 5 years old, but I never really got that experience of just playing around. I think for me, programming has always been work, and that makes me very sad because I know this can be a very rich and rewarding hobby.<p>Can someone point me in the direction of &#x27;fun&#x27; programming? Tools that are just really enjoyable to use? I want to find the joy in computers.",
