Manual bookmarking like upnext&#x2F;readitlater are too slow for my desired workflow - I want literally everything I have ever read to be indexed, on desktop, ipad or iphone. Nice to have - also index what I watch and listen to.<p>I remember that some folks have some kind of pihole thing that snoops the router and scrapes all text to make it searchable but don&#x27;t really know how to do it. I&#x27;m down for that as long as we can keep privacy for each tenant (this is negotiable). Are there any other alternatives?",
