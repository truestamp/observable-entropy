I really don&#x27;t want to collect email &#x2F; user name &#x2F; IP address and so on of the customer ( imagine zero server component if possible ), but at the same time don&#x27;t want the same license to be used on multiple devices (malicious users to exploit this system).\nIs there a way to achieve this? Anyone having experience to share in the field ?",
