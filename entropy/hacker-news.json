Bash way of doing things is now breeze. \nPANTHERBAR- One click popup to copy, translate, search, daily utilities (windows only)\nLightkey - Autocomplete by learning slangs as well.\nLaunchyQT&#x2F;EverythingToolbar - The world is moving forward with forks. Default, UELI and Wox are overrrated. \nPicotorrent - Comes with a scripting language.How cool man!\nSwift selection search -highglight a group of words and multiple customizable search engines popup for your to click.  \nVis&#x2F;Micro - when you talk about Neovide,Kakoune,Spacemacs(&#x2F;vim), you will be talking about them. Different ways of using them.\nSmartup Gestures - Spoil yourself with speed. \nQualys Browsercheck - Maybe your browser and OS are spying and conspiring against you? \nVivaldi&#x2F;Naver Whale - innovative features but closed source web browsers.    \nPotPlayer - highly customizable and competitor for VLC. Likewise Foobar for WinAmp\nQtpass,Gopass- for windows in the lines of pass for UNIX. Different ways of using. passFF integrates pass into firefox.\nQTtabbar - windows explorer on steroids.  \nTwoBird - Gives Thunderbird a run.\nPeertube - Federated Youtube. \nPrivacy redirect - takes you to privacy-enabled front ends of big wigs - seddit, nitter, startpage,Pipe etc.\nublacklist - The search page won&#x27;t show you dubious websites like medical information, stackoverflow dupes or do-nothing pinterest links. \nSponserblock - skip sponser clips on Youtube.\nSidebery - Forget tree style tabs \nFsearch -GUI equivalent of what fzf does. \nNeomutt - Neo generation of mutt\nTranslation comparision Firefox addon - userful for learning language with context.\ntldr++ - A great man once said &quot;software should come to you, you shouldn&#x27;t go to it&quot;.

An anti-malware&#x2F;rootkit tool \nBleachBit - We don&#x27;t need it, but I get fresh laptop.<p>Lastly, Voice finger - A special mention to this 1.5MB app because not a single program could leverage Windows Speech recognition like Voice finger except for Nuance Dragon (GBs). A feature like &quot;Show labels(or number), click G(or 22)&quot; or &quot;show grid, go to 112&quot; will make me join my 4 year undergrad in CS again if possible.
