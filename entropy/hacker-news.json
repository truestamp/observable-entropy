      "text": "The recent Reddit thread posted here about buzzword-filled resumes getting more results got me wondering: What does HN consider a decent résumé when it comes to font choice and graphics?<p>There are many different styles, and presumably, some are better than others for different career paths. However, I wonder what the technology- and engineering-focused groups think is a &quot;stand-out&quot; résumé.<p>For example: While at college, we were informed that a resume should be–aside from consistent–bare bones without any unexpected fonts (only Times New Roman or a basic Sans), styles, or coloration. It should be black text on a white background, no pictures, no styling outside of headings, and so forth. On one hand, it wouldn&#x27;t be distracting, but would it not be wise to stand out in some way than to &quot;blend in,&quot; as it were?",
