Check it out to understand that I am talking about.<p>Anyway, I decided to make a PH pre-launch (not a wise thing, I know). I thought it could help me to figure out, where I should look for potential customers. But it did not really help.<p>So, how do you think, where should I look for these customers? Who should I talk to?<p>Any help is really appreciated. Thanks!",
