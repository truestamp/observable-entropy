      "text": "My laptop is a 2021 M1 Air, with a theoretical 400nits of brightness.  Even under shade, it can be very difficult to see on a bright day outside.<p>The M1 Pro has 500nits SD (text&#x2F;non-video) brightness, so therefore 25% brighter than the Air.<p>Does anyone have experience with both of these laptops outside?  Do you find the Pro to be significantly easier to read in a bright environment?<p>Brightness aside, the Air does everything I need.  An upgrade would be expensive just for better visibility, but it would be worth it if the difference were significant.",

No more benchmarketing, because:<p>* anyone can easily reproduce all the results on their hardware<p>* the results you can see on the website are under version control on GitHub and anyone can run the same website locally in just a minute<p>* every byte of the project is 100% open source including test results and detailed test log<p>* the results are highly accurate with low coefficient of variation<p>The first release has Clickhouse, Elasticsearch, Manticore Search and MySQL covered on small &#x2F; medium and big data realistic data collections. In plans: Percona Server, MongoDB, CocroachDB, FerretDB<p>Links:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;db-benchmarks.com<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;db-benchmarks&#x2F;db-benchmarks<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;db-benchmarks&#x2F;ui<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a member of Manticore Search team and the framework was initially made to compare Manticoresearch with Elasticsearch, but I did my best to not give any unfair advantage to Manticore since it&#x27;s important for the team to understand the real situation. However, if you see something is missing or wrong feel free to make a pull request or an issue on Github. Or make your own fork with even more fair results!<p>Ideas&#x2F;thoughts&#x2F;comments?",
