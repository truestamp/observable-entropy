      "text": "Hi HN, long time reader but first time poster.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on frenemy.live since I first started wfh some time back and realized how isolating it could be. With some inspiration from podcasts, Discord, Omegle and a reality tv show I came up with the idea of matching people for voice calls based on their opinions. These opinions are based on custom statements that I have thought of but are definitely not set in stone and I am open to suggestions. My hope is that frenemy.live facilitates respectful conversation and maybe leads to lasting relationships.<p>So about the technical stuff, the app is written with Elixir and Phoenix with a little NodeJS. I chose this stack after looking into Elixir&#x27;s fault tolerance and capacity for concurrency, its pub-sub features (which really came in handy) and Phoenix LiveView.<p>Constructive feedback is more than welcome and I hope you like the app. (Please don&#x27;t give it the kiss of death)<p>Oh I have also created this discord in case any hiccups happen and people need to find each other. Or you want to report any bugs.\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;f3FJUv2J\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;f3FJUv2J</a>",
