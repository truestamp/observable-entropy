      "text": "tl:dr - Where do you buy software-development-capable computers from for an individual?<p>Long version:\nI&#x27;ve been offered a remote position and have only ever worked on-site up until now. At home I have a fairly basic, years old laptop that is fine for browsing the web and side-project-level development, and a windows machine that I got for my kids to do class work. Neither is really appropriate for &quot;real&quot; software development. Not enough RAM, mainly.<p>I haven&#x27;t had to buy a computer for work in a very long time, and I&#x27;m unsure where to look to get started these days. I realize I could put my own together, but I&#x27;m hoping there&#x27;s an &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; solution.",
