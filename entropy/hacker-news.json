He’s 15 but he is mature and can add some value to SpaceX.<p>SpaceX might already be hosting contests for youth and he could pitch SpaceX for an internship to help them host their youth events. Event contests aren’t anything new. Companies do it all the time.<p>He’d want to work part-time remote as an intern. Thanks in advance for any help you can give!",
