      "text": "Hi everyone, \nWhy is it so difficult to find a space to communicate your open-source project to drive adoption at scale?\nTo recruit new people inside a new company, it&#x27;s not easy to explain the open-source workflow to not-tech people, so most often, great open-source projects have lousy communication.<p>Evangelism, like GitLab said (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;community-relations&#x2F;developer-evangelism&#x2F;#utms-for-url-tagging-and-tracking), is essential.\nThat&#x27;s sure. But how to scale up a team to grow that skill inside the company?<p>Is it better to grow it internally (logically, a founder is the best person to communicate his project)? \nBut how a tech person can develop marketing and communication skills?<p>Or the best way is to recruit a skilled DevRel person or instead of a marketing person and collaborate in creating great content?",

      "text": "Hi guys,<p>I&#x27;m looking for companies that offers Natural Language Generation technology. This is what I need to do: starting from structured data (time-series, records) about some past, current and forecasted phenomena of a specific field, I&#x27;d like to see whether some narrative, in English, can be automatically generated but in a way that does look linguistically rich and semantically grounded. I already tested out some rule-based systems, but they lack the afore mentioned characteristics.<p>Do you guys know of such companies? I would skip research institutions providing pieces of software: I&#x27;m more looking into already built products.<p>Thanks a lot!",
