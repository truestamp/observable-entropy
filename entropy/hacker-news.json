      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m trying to do what Vercel&#x2F;Netlify are doing when you&#x27;re creating &amp; pushing code in a new branch on github: they&#x27;re creating a subdomain where you can isolate &amp; test your code. I really liked how these things worked in Vercel when I&#x27;ve tested NextJS in a project and I was wondering if something like this exists for custom stacks.<p>Is there any devops &#x2F; webdev that dealt with this before? I don&#x27;t wanna reinvent the wheel and google is not that helpful. I have a custom stack with multiple services (frontend, backend, other microservices) that need to be deployed. \nMy first thought was that I could use AWS amplify, but they don&#x27;t support backend stuff (Node) by default.<p>My stack is currently React&#x2F;Node&#x2F;PHP. In simple terms, when I open a new branch in Github, I want to auto create a subdomain for my app in AWS to test the changes independently. The alternative would be to host the test environments somewhere else, which I&#x27;m willing to do as long as it supports custom stacks. I&#x27;m also willing to setup stuff in AWS if someone did this before.<p>Thank you!",
