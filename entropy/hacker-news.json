The guys updated 3 of the 4 billing profiles. The other 3 accounts (all pretty much identical to the one not done and standard ads, nothing dodgy grey zone to the rules) were updated quickly but seem to have missed one.<p>I&#x27;ve been following this up every day or 2 for over a week now and they keep telling me the account will be fixed today + they will contact me with update later that day but neither ever happens.<p>Now the account is paused and I&#x27;ve a very pissed off client.<p>Does anyone here have weight in Adwords world that could help? Something seems to be broken in the request process. I can&#x27;t find any other escalation option so here I am.",
