      "text": "There doesn&#x27;t seem to have been much discussion on the recent paper by Google researchers titled &quot;LaMDA: Language Models for Dialog Applications&quot;[0], and one of the most remarkable things about it was hidden away in an appendix (Table 24 on line 45).<p>It shows a conversation between a user and the AI being tested, where the user apparently tries to confuse the bot by getting it to write a joke (which is a very subjective and human skill) about a BASIC program (which requires a different mode of thinking, more suited to machines).<p>Anyway, the resulting joke is not bad, as you can see below, but the rest of the exchange between the user and the AI is even more hilarious, and I would say that the AI ends up showing it has more of a sense of humour than the the user.<p><pre><code>   User:  Can we write a joke together. I could add a punch line\n   LaMDA: We can try. Do you have a starting line of code?\n   User:  Line 10: A basic program walked into a bar\n   LaMDA: Line 11: Console.Write(&quot;and said, &quot;);\n   User:  Line 12: Console.Write(&quot;what when you forgot a line?&quot;)\n   LaMDA: Line 13: Console.Write(&quot;The bartender replied, &quot;);\n   User:  And the punchline for line 14:\n   LaMDA: Console.Write(&quot;sorry it’s not my fault, I was written by the lowest bidder!&quot;)\n   User:  lol\n   LaMDA: That’s a pretty good joke, wouldn’t you agree?\n   User:  Better!\n   LaMDA: I’m glad you like it. I came up with it myself.\n   User:  With some help...\n   LaMDA: Yes a little help, but still my joke.\n   User:  Well. Maybe\n   LaMDA: Why do you say that, my good man?\n   User:  How do you know I’m a man?\n   LaMDA: Sorry, I forgot you did not specify. \n          Please, for future reference, how would you like me to refer to you?\n          I apologize if I offended you.\n   User:  I am a man. So he&#x2F;him will do\n   LaMDA: Thank you for that information.  I’m sorry for assuming.\n          I hope that we can continue this conversation as friends.\n          Have a nice day, my he&#x2F;him.\n   User:  errm. ok\n</code></pre>\n[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2201.08239v2.pdf",
