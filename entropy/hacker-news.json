I have looked around at things like react, angular, vue, svelte, ember and so on but all of them seem pretty hefty for the purpose. I could use vanilla JS but I am in the mood for testing something new. The other parts of the tech stack are going to be node&#x2F;express, some css framework like tailwind or bulma and sqlite. Basically to be as &quot;portable&quot; as possible.<p>Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.",
