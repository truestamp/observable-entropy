I am old-school geek when it comes to appreciating IMAP&#x2F;POP Mail, IRC, RSS and BBS. I saw Vivaldi announcing their new browser integration with Mail and RSS. Maybe they are embracing the great old technology that is a still a power house for retro geeks like me. I am asking my fellow geek friends if they have tried Vivaldi and if it’s worth the switch?",
