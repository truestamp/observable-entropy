      "text": "Hey, I&#x27;m looking for suggestions on a book to help relearn some math.<p>I went through engineering school and had to take many advanced math classes, but it&#x27;s been enough years that I&#x27;ve forgotten much of what I had learned. I&#x27;m sure it is not all forgotten, it just needs to be reawoken.<p>I was considering picking up some textbooks, but then I remembered I didn&#x27;t find them all that helpful back then so that is unlikely to have changed.<p>Maybe what I&#x27;m hoping for doesn&#x27;t exist, but it would be great to find a book that does a high level overview of lots of different types of math and relates those to some real world scenarios. I&#x27;ve found this grokking algorithms book which has been helpful but I haven&#x27;t found something analogous for mathematics.<p>If you know of any good books I would appreciate you sharing it.",
