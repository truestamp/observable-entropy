      "text": "I&#x27;m currently in the midst of a pretty substantial non-fiction writing project (a series of critical essays altogether roughly the length of a short book).<p>I&#x27;ve written short essays before, but nothing of this scale. I&#x27;ve developed most of the ideas, fleshed them out, written rough explanations, etc. I know roughly how everything will string together. But I&#x27;m feeling kinda stuck and overwhelmed with the task before me, of assembling everything together, knowing where to put what, concerned whether I&#x27;ll over-explain or repeat myself, etc etc.<p>One particular problem I&#x27;m experiencing is that, while I know and remember all the points I&#x27;m trying to make, I feel like I&#x27;ve kinda &quot;lost touch&quot; with some of them, like I&#x27;m just robotically piecing ideas together. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I hope that makes some sense.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;ll probably figure out some of these things as I go, but it&#x27;d be nice to hear how others have navigated big complex (non-fiction) writing projects like this.<p>So, writers of long-form non-fiction (or non-fiction book writers even): What&#x27;s your process for navigating all this?<p>Thanks!",
