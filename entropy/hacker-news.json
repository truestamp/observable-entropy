      "text": " Greetings fellow founders!<p>For those looking to scale revenue through a more repeatable, efficient Sales &amp; Onboarding process…<p>We’ve spent the past few months at Accord curating playbooks from the WORLD&#x27;S TOP STARTUPS to share with the YC &amp; startup community (from Figma, Productboard, Stripe, Pilot.com , YC peers, etc)<p>Access the gallery for free! (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inaccord.com&#x2F;playbook-gallery)<p>Why&#x27;d we build this vs just focusing on more product?<p>- After launching last year, we heard from founders:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not a sales &#x2F; onboarding expert, how do I build a winning process to hit my ARR targets??&quot;\n&quot;I don&#x27;t want to start from scratch - who has best practices to use?&quot;<p>- And startup sales leaders:<p>&quot;I need everyone on my team selling like our best rep (proactive, engaging, transparent), how do I align them around our playbook and drive consistency?&quot;\n&quot;How are others doing this?&quot;<p>You can now access all of these insights &amp; winning processes, distilled into easy to use playbooks, for free.<p>Spanning multiple use cases (from sales-led to PLG, and POCs to implementation), and for companies from Seed to hyper growth scale.<p>Whether you’re looking for customer onboarding guides, mutual action plans, or rep training checklists, we’ve got something for you!<p>Hope these are helpful :)",
