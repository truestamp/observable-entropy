      "text": "With all the news about the Apple M2 and the people excited to sunset their couple years old computers, I feel compelled to share my reality (and that of many others outside the HN bubble).<p>I&#x27;m a 27 years old software developer from Brazil. The computer in question was assembled in 2007 from parts that were mostly bought abroad (and then gifted to me) by a wealthier relative that was visiting. That&#x27;s a key point: the currency exchange rates and the import taxes make electronics out of reach for the common folks.<p>That was an AMD2+ motherboard, 4GB of DDR2, a 5400 RPM rust spinner, and a Phenom X4 coupled with an ATI 4870.<p>Although the household was never in a dire situation financially, I had always been taught by example to fix things and keep using them for as long as possible. Even back in elementary school times I would troubleshoot computer issues myself and brush off dust from the components.<p>Yes, there have been hardware failures since 2007: two HDDs died (about 6 years lifespan for each), the 4870 died (but I extended its life for one more year with the bake-it-in-the-oven trick), one DIMM failure, a PSU blowout and a CPU cooler bracket mechanical failure.<p>All replacements that had to be purchased would cost me a significant amount of money. HDDs and PSUs were not that expensive, but GPUs were out of reach. When that DIMM died in 2018, I purchased an used and dusty DDR2 replacement kit off AliExpress.<p>After the pandemic hit and I got my first proper (remote) job in 2020, I splurged and replaced some components: a hand-me-down GPU from a wealthier friend (I had been using the onboard graphics since the 4870 died), an AMD3 motherboard, a Phenom II X4 and some DDR3, all used and from AliExpress.<p>The monitor, a 22&quot; TFT panel from Samsung, is still kicking since 2017 with a couple of dead pixels. Same goes for the mouse, manufactured by an unknown Chinese brand, and a membrane keyboard that I completely disassembled and scrubbed clean under a running faucet.<p>Even with my career finally taking off (I&#x27;m due to complete undergraduate Computer Science this year) I don&#x27;t see myself doing major upgrades&#x2F;purchases any soon.<p>When was the last time you gave something extra life instead of throwing it away?",

      "text": "Anyone have experience placing 10s-100s of computers into paid service (e.g. MQL5 [1], Digital Coin Generation [2], Golem P2P network [3], MinePrize [4], etc) or with distributed decentralized storage (SiaCoin [5] vs Storj [6] vs Filecoin [7])?  Is it worth the effort? Best practices?  Any exacerbated security or support concerns?  What about altruistic grid computing through BOINC, Rosetta@home etc?
