Taught myself modern HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, common JS libraries, SASS&#x2F;SCSS. Built some portfolio. Hustled and did a bit of freelance work.<p>I am now attempting to find a job doing front end development, but I&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s pretty discouraging to apply for an entry level job with 100+ other applicants and rarely hear back from the company or recruiter.<p>What would you suggest to someone like me trying to work their way in?<p>P.S. Currently learning more about MongoDB, node&#x2F;express, and Typescript because a lot of jobs ask for experience here. Maybe this is the problem? Just not knowing enough tools?",
