      "text": "My main computing device is a Lenovo x220 with xubuntu. It does 99% of what I need; I love it.<p>I also own a 2021 Ipad Pro. I bought it as a Nomad Sculpt and Procreate machine. However, I&#x27;ve really been getting into graphics programming lately and would love to start building my own custom tools and augmented reality graphics sketches. I&#x27;m specifically interested in getting some experience in with the Metal API.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have $2k or even $500 to drop on an apple compute device. I have an old, very beat up 2010 MBP, but I don&#x27;t know how much use it would be. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to develop on it.<p>Are there any reasonably priced services that I could use to compile apps for IpadOS? It seems like in this day and age I ought to be able to write the whole thing on my preferred xubuntu machine, then send that over to something else for &quot;apple-compliant-compilation&quot; and so on and so forth.",
