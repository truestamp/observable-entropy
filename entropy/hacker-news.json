      "text": "Rust is a popular, exciting, modern programming language, but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding Rust events, meetups, and user groups in my area (San Francisco). There have been essentially zero Rust events on Meetup in the last six months. None of the groups that were active when I looked two years ago have any activity.<p>Where does the Rust community gather and hang out IRL to discuss projects and exchange ideas? Where are upcoming Rust conferences announced? Is anyone organizing lightning talks or meet-and-greets anymore?",
