      "text": "In the comments today on the weatherspark new visualization I saw people lamenting the demise of a legacy Flash dashboard. Reminds me that people have asked me a couple of times for ways to run legacy Flash content.<p>Basically this would be a self hosted secure proxy to run Flash content on the server, and I think it could possible be a more reliable way to run legacy Flash content then using a wasm run time in in the browser.<p>I have a remote browser isolation product that people have requested me a few times if I could get it to run legacy Flash content and I think it would be possible by using an older version of chromium or Chrome I&#x27;m running out with xvfb rather than headless and making sure the correct user profile or extensions are installed in order to run the flash content. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s definitely possible and I haven&#x27;t prototyped it but I think it could be and so I&#x27;m trying to gauge if there&#x27;s enough interest in order to build this so far the people that have requested this have mostly been looking for something completely free.<p>If it works it could possibly be a way to run legacy Flash content reliably, possibly more reliably than other product options for doing so which I think are mostly wasm runtimes  on the browser. I think there&#x27;s one called CreeperX or CheerpX.<p>If you want to reach out to me privately instead of here you can email me cris@dosycorp.com",
