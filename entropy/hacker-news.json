      "text": "I purchased Jabra 85t bluetooth earbuds a 2 months ago.\nAfter updating Macos to Monterey, the mic drops after a random amount of time on Google Hangout and sometimes Slack, in the span of 20 minutes.<p>This is not an isolated case, users have been complaining about it.\nFor instance on Reddit:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Jabra&#x2F;comments&#x2F;qjwxdu&#x2F;muting_during_slackzoom_calls_on_mac_elite_85t&#x2F;<p>On this post, official Jabra Support declares: &quot;We do not support the use of the Jabra Elite 85t on computers&quot;\nI also reached out to their support per email, and after a few back and forth and reaching their Lead, the answer is the same.\nThey won&#x27;t provide a refund nor solutions.<p>This limitation isn&#x27;t advertised on the official Amazon offer nor on their official website.\nAmazon: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B08HR78C46&#x2F;\nOfficial website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jabra.com&#x2F;bluetooth-headsets&#x2F;jabra-elite-85t<p>In the absence of advertised limitation, shouldn&#x27;t the mic work (without dropping) with every device supporting the adequate BT profiles?\nHow is a user supposed to know they don&#x27;t support computers?",
