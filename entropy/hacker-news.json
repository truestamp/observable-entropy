      "text": "Hello HN! My name is Haruna Oseni currently an International student at Houston Community College, also working as a freelance Software Engineer and part time programming tutor @HCC (Javascript , python etc.), I am more of a generalist engineer (front end, now playing around with backend, done some data science and more), I enjoy being uncomfortable and tackling hard projects which I have no idea how to even begin then learning what I need to get the job done, I am currently working on an app (startup), watch, the goal is to basically enable users experience more during a video call. I will be graduating from HCC may 18. Writing software is an obsession at this point, I&#x27;m very interested in consumer product, fintech(payment), logistics software etc. After graduation to be honest guys, I want to find like minded individuals&#x2F;team whose dream is to build an insanely successful company, or looking for a cofounder or a team member, hell, just little help on their startup. If that resonates with you, shoot me an email (harunaoseni23@gmail.com), lets change the world (seriously, I will literally relocate after graduation without seconds thoughts if anyone here resonates with this, note: I could care less about a salary atm)!! sorry for the long text guys.... here&#x27;s my hub of git, cheers --&gt; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;harunaOseni",
