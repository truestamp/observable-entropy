      "text": "Hi HN, I&#x27;m half of a two-person game studio called Milkbag Games. We made a mobile &amp; PC word puzzle game a few years ago called Sidewords. It&#x27;s a unique blend of spatial puzzle and word puzzle. With the current Wordle craze we realized we could make a web-playable version with Wordle-style emoji sharing etc, so that&#x27;s what we did.<p>We obviously don&#x27;t expect it to be anywhere near as popular as Wordle, but hopefully people enjoy the spatial puzzle aspect of it. We aren&#x27;t worried about making money, it&#x27;s just a fun way to get more people to play our game.<p>As far as tech goes, the original game was made in Unity, but we decided to make this version using Pixi.js to cut down on load times. We do some interesting stuff to pre-generate puzzles (using dancing links&#x2F;algorithm x), which we can talk about if there are questions about it.",
