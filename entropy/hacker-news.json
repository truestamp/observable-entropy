Where should I live?<p>Wish list:<p>1) Very warm climate (Brisbane has this)<p>2) Decent tech scene (or in a near enough timezone to enables remote work for US or EU employers) (Brisbane barely has this)<p>3) ACTUALLY diverse and cultured (Brisbane has gotten a lot better in the past ten years, but falls well short here IMO)<p>4) Non-car centric with good public and alternative transport opportunities (Brisbane falls well short here too)<p>The ultimate city for me would have the huge population and excellent public transport of Tokyo, the diversity of NY, Miami, London and Paris, the climate of Singapore and the non-car centrism of Amsterdam.<p>Short list so far:<p>* Barcelona?<p>* Lisbon?<p>* Miami?<p>* Austin?<p>* Tel Aviv?<p>* ??? Any Latin American or African cities I&#x27;m missing? Maybe Fortaleza, Recife, Salvador Bahia, Lagos, Dakar ???<p>Cities like NY, Toronto are diverse and have lots of opportunities but are too cold. Also not that great on public and alternative transport.<p>Sydney, Melbourne and Vancouver are too cold in winter and not that diverse. Also not that great on public and alternative transport.<p>Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen are very non-car centric but too cold.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m too picky and probably asking for the impossible =) but would love to hear more suggestions",
