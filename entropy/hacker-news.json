      "text": "Has anyone ever switched clouds from one service provider to another (e.g. AWS to Azure or vice versa), partially or entirely?<p>If so why? They all offer almost identical services. Do small (but maybe significant?) differences or unique products (e.g. Spanner) make such a big difference that it has swayed someone to switch their cloud infrastructure?<p>I wonder how much these little things matter and how such a transition (in partial or as a whole) went along and how key stakeholders (who were possibly heavily invested in one cloud or felt they were responsible for the initial choice) were convinced to make the switch?<p>I&#x27;d love to hear some stories from real world experiences and crucially what it was that pushed the last domino to make the move.",
