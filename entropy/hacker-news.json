      "text": "I posted something to Show HN earlier today and my analytics dashboard (Simple Analytics) tells me that ⅔ of the visits are direct &#x2F; no referrer.<p>At first I though they must be running in Incognito&#x2F;Private mode, but I tested Chrome&#x2F;Firefox&#x2F;Safari and they all still send the referer in the request header even in Incognito&#x2F;Private mode, which seems odd to me as that would be an easy thing to hide.<p>So what would cause this? Ad blockers? Corporate firewalls and proxies? Or are ⅔ of you copying and pasting the links on HN instead of just clicking?",
