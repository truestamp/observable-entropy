I loved playing games with friends, I loved typing code from magazines, I loved creating sprites on paper and dreaming of giving them life on my Commodore 64.<p>My second exciting thing was my first modem and the first connections to the local BBS in my town. I loved chatting with people, I loved downloading JPGs (well, you can imagine what kind).<p>My third exciting thing was the internet. This was an evolution of my second exciting thing, it was BBS on steroids. I loved visiting my local newsstand and buying the new issue of .Net magazine. The final pages always included a list of cool new websites to try.<p>My fourth exciting thing was social media. I loved keeping in touch with friends on Twitter, Friendfeed, Facebook, etc.<p>My fifth exciting thing was Bitcoin. I got lost in the rabbit hole, having fun mining with my computer (when it was too late to make money), spending hours reading posts on btctalk, buying my first Bitcoin from a guy at a coffee shop for cash, mining with my first Butterfly hardware (again, not enough to make a profit), building my Raspiblitz, staring at Blockchain.info waiting for the next block to be mined.<p>It has now been quite a while since the last time I was excited about something. The top excitement for Bitcoin was maybe around 2015. Now it&#x27;s just all about money money money on crypto or developments that are way too complex for me to understand.<p>What is exciting you nowadays? Any new technology, any new website, any new cool thing going on in the tech world?",
