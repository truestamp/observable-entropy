Very often Safari will only render part of the page. I notice it most often when searching Google. When scrolling part way down it just cuts off and I only have 5 tabs open! These are both fresh systems running brand new installs of macOS Monterey Version 12.0.1. How is such a rudimentary function, page rendering, broken on these bad boys?",
