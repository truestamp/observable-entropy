      "text": "Participation in technical discussion can be hard, and frankly I feel that I&#x27;ve lost my confidence over the last year.  (Possibly a covid&#x2F;remote effect, but not my main aim with this question.)  Depending on the topic or scope, such discourse can cover a lot of a tech stack and&#x2F;or functional ground.  I feel as if I&#x27;ve lost a large degree of confidence in simply participating in discussion, and for myself approaching mid-career it&#x27;s both troubling and humbling.  I hope to ASK-HN a discussion or hear people&#x27;s perspectives.<p>In the moment: during discussions of late I&#x27;ve become severely hesitant to chime in, either through uncertainty or general lack of confidence about how my three cents (inflation) will fit within the discourse.  I have observed and generalized a few (of my own) causes:<p>- The need to be precise+accurate with any statement.  (A dysfunctional workplace will not leave room for self-effacing behavior.  But there&#x27;s still a self check of &quot;is what I&#x27;m about to say correct or additive ... enough?&quot;)\n- Missing half a sentence and suddenly I&#x27;m permanently behind the topic track.\n- Or it seems that everyone else is speaking with such confidence that everyone already commands an extra layer&#x2F;depth of understanding on the subject matter, and I&#x27;m a fish out of water.\n- And I&#x27;ve noticed a follow-on effect after someone has added to the conversation, because that addition to the discourse may seem &quot;obvious&quot; to me, that I&#x27;ll either enter a self-bullying spiral of &quot;why couldn&#x27;t you have said that because you already knew it&quot; or &quot;well this discussion is full of people stating the obvious, you are allowed to mentally check out now.&quot;<p>Did you know that Holden Caufield is actually a JS developer in the year 2022?!  I would like to opine that this is appreciably different from impostor syndrome.  (Though I do believe it&#x27;s real and enjoy any related posts, recently [1].)  And it&#x27;s because there&#x27;s always code to &#x27;retreat&#x27; to, because it&#x27;s the &#x27;real&#x27; work and because code is altogether a product&#x2F;craft&#x2F;skill&#x2F;ground-truth&#x2F;machine and related discussion will always feel subordinate.  Or it seems easier to effect the team with a confluence&#x2F;wiki page (which can contain code snippets).  In no way do I think this is correct or healthy, but it&#x27;s so easy to slip into a mode of &#x27;retreat to the code&#x27;, and it can be speciously validated that it&#x27;s &quot;going back to where things matter.&quot;<p>Just as beer is the social lubricant, I&#x27;m looking for my &#x27;professional beer&#x27;.  Obviously not a cure-all pill, but how to ease some accumulated inhibitions, and participate in technical discussion without having to worry about the act of participating.  I&#x27;m curious to hear anyone&#x27;s experience or journey especially in the realm of technology and software jobs and roles.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31129716",
