We’ve automated ETL for hundreds of public and proprietary data sources, surfacing ready-to-use live-updating visualizations in as little as 3 clicks. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) inflation and employment data, FRED economic and automotive data, and hundreds of other fascinating data feeds are already piped in and at your fingertips – the only thing left is for you to create your own custom visualizations and generate insights from them. Dataherald helps you tell stories with data faster.<p>Take it for a spin and tell me what you think. We’re specifically interested in your feedback for the software interface and what data sources you would want (and for what purpose).",
