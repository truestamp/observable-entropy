      "text": "Technical skills are no doubt in very high demand right now. If an experienced engineer can make over $500K&#x2F;yr plus benefits working 40 hours a week at a large company, there <i>should</i> be an opportunity to spend a few extra hours on a side gig to increase that number by a few percent.<p>From what I can see, however, there is no straightforward process for this. Online freelancing platforms are a crapshoot. Starting your own consultancy takes a lot of initial effort and capital. Entrepreneurship is even riskier and more time consuming.<p>For someone in my position who is not looking to quit my job, start a billion dollar company or change the world, just convert some of my spare time into spending money, what is the best solution at present? Has anyone else run into this problem and found a good solution?",
