      "text": "Instead of wasting a few days with phone screen, remote technical, then a day of 4-5 interviews, why not just do one interview that&#x27;s a couple of hours and have it be a case study?<p>I used to work at a big law firm during college, and noticed lawyers would come and go for interviews and the format was case studies. Lawyers seem to be saturated, and this was how the best of the best (this was a top big law firm) would be selected.<p>Why can&#x27;t we do this in tech? For example, if you had some huge performance issues and you fixed them a certain way, you could share the problem with your interviewee and spend a couple hours going from ideation on a whiteboard to putting together a system design or something of the solution.",
