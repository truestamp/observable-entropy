      "text": "I&#x27;m a security specialist. I manage a great deal of APIs. With regards to security testing APIs, there aren&#x27;t many devices for the gig.\nMost devices were worked for web applications, particularly for checking security defects from heritage application server designs, program, meeting, account login, and so on. In any case, API has none of these issues.\nWith regards to API security testing, an alternate device is required that can dive deep into APIs, OAuth 2.0, and business-rationale defects as opposed to the inheritance approach.\nWe thought of this straightforward device that naturally security tests APIs. If it&#x27;s not too much trouble, attempt this device and get a free API security testing report for your public, portable, and web APIs.",
