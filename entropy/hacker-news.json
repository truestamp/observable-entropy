      "text": "It seems backwards to me to tax profits and not losses. We want to incentivize profits, not losses, so why are we taxing them to incentivize the opposite? Aren&#x27;t we encouraging shady accounting practices by incentivizing companies to disguise profits as losses?<p>Would it mean that companies take fewer risks if the bill for a failed project would be higher? Does that stifle innovation?<p>To preemptively qualify: I don&#x27;t think taxes on profits should go away completely, but perhaps the tax burden could be shifted, so that some % comes from profits, and some % comes from losses, such that the net revenue to the government is the same, while still employing this new incentivization structure.",
