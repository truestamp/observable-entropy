      "text": "An Ukrainian colleague of my wife (and at least one family member of theirs) is near Kryvy Rih (central south), and we are trying to see how to get them to Moldova which seems to be the closest border.<p>Communication is a bit choppy so I don&#x27;t know if they have a car yet. But im trying to find maps &#x2F; sites that could help to find the safest route. There is almost a straight line west. But I have no live info if this is safe.  Google maps shows a southern route via Odessa etc, but that obviously doesnt take into account any of the developments. (The people helping don&#x27;t speak the language)",
