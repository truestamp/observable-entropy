      "text": "TL;DR: I&#x27;m nervous about my product&#x27;s future as I don&#x27;t talk to users. I want to change that asap.<p>I&#x27;m a solo founder with a product out for 6 years now. Although it&#x27;s in a big market, it has a small user base (1000 monthly actives) and brings in a small amount of revenue (~300 USD MRR). Savings from prior job are enough to get by where I live.<p>I have the skills to make the software a lot better but I&#x27;ve been burned enough by building features that might or might not get used. So, I&#x27;ve kind of frozen further product development until I figure out how to get users to talk.<p>I&#x27;m a good communicator, genuinely care about solving problems for users and love talking to users, but I can&#x27;t seem to get users to reply. I used to do hand-typed emails and got some success out of it with poor conversion (1 out of 200 replied). Because hand-typed was hard, I started using automated welcome emails and got almost nil response. I&#x27;ve been using automated welcome email for more than a year now and yesterday I turned it off as I thought it might be hurting my brand rather than helping.<p>I&#x27;m feeling down that I have the capability to build but I can&#x27;t get users to talk.<p>YC advises to &quot;talk to users&quot;.. but &quot;how to first get them to reply to my request for feedback&quot; is the #1 problem for me. I&#x27;m starting to think I have to up the psychology game to get a reply.<p>Some solutions I&#x27;ve thought of but yet to implement:\n1. Persistence: hand-type email to users and follow up gently week after week up to 3-4 times.\n2. Bribe: entice users with a good offer on the product or a gift card to get them to reply\n3. Be goody two shoes: provide an opt-in for emails during sign up. But I think nobody will opt-in.<p>Any advice on what could yield a reply from a user? I am prepared to hand-type emails every day if that&#x27;s what it takes.",
