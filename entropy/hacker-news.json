      "text": "Hi<p>My English is not great, so please bare with me.<p>I have been suffering from major social anxiety and depression from my teenage years. College was difficult time but I made it through with friends who always supported me. Now I am working as tech lead at very small company (people who saw my previous work) for very little salary and general consensus from people I have worked with is that I am good developer. But the anxiety is getting better off me.<p>I am trying to land job at well established remote companies for last few months, answered few interviews but always failed to impress the interviewer. I even shortens my introduction saying &quot;I am a backend developer&quot; for reason I do not know. Truth is coding just one part of my job and I basically handle everything related to tech in the company and handle multiple projects. Codeparing becomes another nightmare where I cannot even think properly and solve simple problems.<p>2 days ago I answered technical interview from like my dream company, that would have changed my life but instead we ended up just having some discussion, didn&#x27;t even manage to fix one spec. Actually I know I can fix all of those in like 15 min.<p>Its making me question my whole career as developer now. Does anyone here been through similar situation ? Any suggestion?",
