So there&#x27;s some sort of relationship where Big Bank Corp. has their own in-house engineers, who also work alongside &#x27;Dev Shop&#x27; engineers placed in their office.<p>I&#x27;ve interviewed with both companies, have been approved and have received an offer.<p>I&#x27;m familiar with Patio11&#x27;s essays on salary negotiation, however I&#x27;m not sure about the dynamics of who pays who how much between these companies, and how much room I actually have to move upwards.<p>I&#x27;m continuing to interview with another company. Does anyone have insight on contractor payments&#x2F;relationships? How is &#x27;Dev Shop&#x27; compensated for my work?",
