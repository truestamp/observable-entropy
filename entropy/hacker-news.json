      "text": "I have an on-going personal project to host an off-grid server from my van. I have a few Raspberry Pis that I&#x27;m going to use, and as it stands I&#x27;ve assembled two of them into a K3s cluster.<p>My reasoning behind using Kubernetes is that I want something that supervises the server and makes sure everything stays healthy, and I also want to stay familiar with modern technology. In addition, I&#x27;d like to make it as easy as possible to add more computing power to the setup and I&#x27;ve found K3s tools that seem to do a good job of that.<p>My main question is: Am I over-engineering this setup? If so, what should I be using instead? If not, are there any tips and tricks that people have to make the most of this kind of setup? I know I&#x27;m not the first person to set up a home server on RPis, but I imagine most people aren&#x27;t trying to take it off-grid for extended periods.",
