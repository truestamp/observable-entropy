I want to (need to!) learn more about dev ops so that I can migrate us off limited tools like Firebase, which are starting to limit us.<p>Is an AWS cert a reasonable and effective way to do that? How did y&#x27;all learn more about dev ops?<p>I don&#x27;t want to be an SRE, but I want to be able to build our applications without being locked into very limited and opinionated services.",

And there&#x27;s been a lot of these things lately. When I&#x27;ve talked to friends and acquaintances about it, we can agree that it&#x27;s a ridiculous thing that doesn&#x27;t change anything. Yet, in PR, media, and other popularity-based professions, there seems to be a very different arrangement of perspectives and emotions.<p>In my opinion, this is an era where more people should be exposed to Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; and similar perspectives, but all we get is some sort of synthetic flock mentality.<p>I was too young to notice all the details in people&#x27;s behaviour in the post-2001 political climate (and I&#x27;ve never been to the US). Anyone with some interesting perspectives who remembers?",
