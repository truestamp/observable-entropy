      "text": "Hey HN.<p>I got rid of my car almost 10 years ago, and I live 15 minutes from Walmart. I sometimes have to go and get a crate of beer, milk, some coke-zero and this is a major pain in the ass to trek home. Tears my hands to ribbons.<p>For years I have wanted a box on wheels that I can control. I am a software guy. Think of a radio controlled car, but a bit more meat.<p>I know there are weird boards that look almost like lego with holes, and things like Raspberry PIs or Arduinos.<p>Would anyone be able to point me to a single starting point for my electronic journey towards this goal so I can spend 2022 with a new hobby?<p>Thanks for reading.",
