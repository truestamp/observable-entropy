      "text": "Hi all, I&#x27;m building a small web app using a bunch of no-code tools and would really like to know if I can generate a website via an API call. Is there any such service out there you have experience with? My search brought me no results except for an enterprise solution from a website builder called Duda.co but that is way out of budget.<p>The tool I&#x27;m creating is for a real estate agency. Users from the agency will login to the app and submit details about a house for sale. Using that information we go and make a WordPress website. I&#x27;m looking to automate this by passing the information the user submit via an API call to a website builder of some sort to instantly generate a website.<p>Any help in this would be hugely appreciated!",
