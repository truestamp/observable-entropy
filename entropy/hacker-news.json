      "text": "I am graduating next year with a Masters in Mathematics, in Germany. I also hold a Bachelors in Mathematics and a Bachelors in Physics. In my Masters I focused on numerics, numerical methods, finite element method, simulations (molecular dynamics and sph), machine learning and data science. I have programmed many things in many languages and am pretty confident I can pickup any required technical skillset easily. I am currently also employed as a research assistant applying Graph Neural Networks to engineering applications.<p>I would say my three biggest skills are: \n1. mathematical maturity, being able to make sense of any given piece of mathematical literature (with some patience and time of course)\n2. analytical and methodological mindset, in simple words, am good at problem solving\n3. extensive experience in software development across many domains from web dev to running simulations on HPCs.<p>My areas of interest are mostly numerical simulations and deep learning. I don&#x27;t like data science that much.<p>Now, the question is, which employers (preferable in Germany) would be interested in my skillset? I am at a loss where I should be applying for jobs. I have a pretty safe career trajectory in academia if I want to go that route, but I am also exploring alternatives in industry or maybe in some research institute other than my current institution.",
