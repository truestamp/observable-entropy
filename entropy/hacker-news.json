      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m Robbert, creator of fast JavaScript data table library DataGridXL. You might have seen the Hacker News post a few days ago where I introduced v2 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30919257).<p>The product is a solo effort (and ideally it should stay that way).<p>My question is: should I write as &quot;I&quot; on my website or &quot;we&quot;?<p>I chose to communicate using &quot;we&quot; on my website. The main reason for this is that I am afraid that (larger) companies would not take my product seriously when they find out that it&#x27;s a one man project. I would miss out on sales.<p>However, it would be nice to not have to pretend. I know other creators (Pieter Levels of Nomadlist comes to mind) that do not pretend to be a company of people.<p>Are there any people on this forum that have dealt with this for their own product? Or perhaps have a strong opinion on this topic? I am very much open to suggestions.",
