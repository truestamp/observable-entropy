      "text": "It&#x27;s been already 4 months since JDK17 was released, but Guice (one of the most popular Java dependency injection frameworks) still didn&#x27;t release required compatibility changes [1]. There looks to be zero contact with maintainers at Google. In the meantime Spring was ready for JDK17 in July (3 months before JDK17 GA) [2]<p>For years I advocated to use Guice at my companies, as it&#x27;s considerably less bloated than Spring. Now I&#x27;m starting to get some heat on this as it&#x27;s clear that the support is just not there. Is this the right time to accept the defeat and start migrating back to Spring?<p>[1] \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;guice&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1536\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;snicoll&#x2F;status&#x2F;1420652097373188100",
