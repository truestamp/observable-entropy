      "text": "Recently, I cannot help but notice how shy and socially awkward I might be at times, which is quite frustrating.<p>To be fair to myself, I am not awful in social situations in that depending on the context I can be seemingly confident and calm, especially when I am among people I know and the context is familiar.<p>When it comes to new people and places, everything changes dramatically. My voice changes, my posture changes, everything changes. I can start being awkward in all possible senses.<p>The discomfort gets to the point where I blush and this physical state of vulnerability and self-doubt of course makes things even worse :)<p>I understand that all of that relates to self-esteem and phychology in general therefore my question.<p>It&#x27;s common to advise hitting on the gym, which I just started doing last week. Funnily, the gym is the place where I last noticed my awkward behavior :)<p>If you have managed to deal with that and improve in that regard, what is your success story?",
