      "text": "I am very careful with my email inbox, and try to unsubscribe regularly to commercial emails I get from various service I sign up to. From my understanding, lately in Europe it was forbidden to make commercial email notification opt-in the default, but still there are some services which find creative ways to send you unwanted emails and I always take the steps needed to unsubscribe when I see messages like that landing in my inbox. So three weeks ago my inbox was fine and clean with just the emails I want to receive.<p>Then I moved to the US, and all of a sudden, starting maybe a week ago (so ~two weeks after moving), I&#x27;ve started receiving a lot of new different commercial emails and general notifications from various services. That&#x27;s happened with <i>a lot</i> of different services, from social media, online shops I&#x27;ve used maybe once, to that time I left my email while registering my purchase in a french music shop in Paris. My wife who moved with me is also experiencing the same thing.<p>So I have some questions: first of all, are those services behaving differently depending on your location? are these services assuming I opt-in to options that are maybe forbidden by Europe by default, but not in the US? And what if I am just in a vacation? But foremost, How do they know I&#x27;m in the US? Remember the music shop in Paris, or some services I&#x27;ve not visited for a while?<p>While I do have some ideas on how this sorcery may work, if you know something more feel free to comment.<p>Did some of you also experienced something like this?",
