      "text": "Technology never stops marching on. What are some job titles or departments that didn&#x27;t exist 10 years ago? Or what roles existed 10 years ago but were not widely known but are now mainstream?<p>Two examples:<p><i>YouTuber</i><p>Some people were probably making a full-time income from YouTube 10 years ago, but the role &quot;YouTuber&quot; is much more mainstream and well-known today. Plus, thousands (millions?) of people are now full-time YouTubers covering every interest under the sun.<p><i>Social Media roles</i><p>I saw the following job title recently: <i>Head of Brand Engagement and Social Media</i> - which made me wonder if titles liked this existed 10 years ago? Or are they only now mainstream and more common?<p>Note: Although I have listed technology-related roles, are there new roles from the past 10 years not principally about technology?",
