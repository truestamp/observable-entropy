      "text": "When it comes to the EV boom in the near future or maybe now, there is an Infrastructure Bill to support&#x2F;Boost it. Shares of Lightning eMotors (NYSE:ZEV) soared on Tuesday after the provider of specialty commercial electric vehicles announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s Forest River. The agreement between both parties may surpass $850 million dollars in investment to achieve the target to deploy up to 7,500 zero-emission shuttle buses.<p>Lightning eMotors will build fully electric powertrains and provide charging products and services to Forest River for the next four and a half years. Forest River sells more than 10,000 vehicles annually. Its large-scale production levels will allow Lightning eMotors to offer best-in-class prices to its network of over 100 dealers.<p>&quot;This has the potential to be the largest contract ever in the electric shuttle bus market, and we believe it will be the catalyst for other large commercial vehicle OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and fleets to accelerate their adoption of commercial electric vehicles,&quot; Lightning eMotors CEO Tim Reeser said.<p>Lightning eMotors and Forest River will collectively try to meet the Economic, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals and as well save the costs of fossil fuels.",
