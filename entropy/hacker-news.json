I was doing a bit of web development, mostly frontend stuff, and was proud of how many obscure HTML elements I was using like &lt;DETAILS&gt; and &lt;CITE&gt; etc. Then the urge to open a browser came within 10 minutes of coding. I wanted to code a hamburger menu, but didn&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel. Specifically I wanted the hamburger menu to work with CSS only so was looking for a snippet of code that done that, but had no Internet.<p>I was genuinely asking myself: &#x27;Am I even a competent developer if I have to use the Internet every five minutes to code?&#x27;<p>How do you cope with this feeling, of tapping into the Internet hive mind to code properly?",
