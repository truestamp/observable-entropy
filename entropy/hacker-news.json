      "text": "Recently came across a posting for a Director level technical role where the initial remote interview involves a coding test. Personally I consider coding tests not very useful, as I can learn more about a candidate in interactive discussions about problems and solutions, where I can see what their thought process is instead of what test questions they can answer from memory.<p>While I believe that the best management is capable of understanding the work their team does, coding tests for director level positions is a red flag, because it brings up a question of what they really want to hire for.<p>Does the audience here agree, or is it possible my distaste for coding tests is coloring my perspective?",

I want to look beyond FAANG, for other places that have a lower barrier of entry, but still provide a good training regimen.<p>I&#x27;m a software programmer who&#x27;s been out of work since late 2019 and have roughly 10 YOE (though I fall usually in junior or mid-level rank).<p>What are some larger companies that can provide adequate training for people lagging behind? Perhaps consultancies and body shops are for me... if so, which in particular would you recommend?<p>I know the core knowledge of my job to be:<p>- Algorithms and data structures\n- Imperative and OO programming\n- Control flow\n- Design patterns<p>And peripheral knowledge:<p>- Front-end frameworks\n- Back-end frameworks\n- Cloud services\n- Testing\n- Automation and Deployment<p>I&#x27;m fairly good with a lot of the core knowledge, although with data structures and algorithms, my ability to solve problems using them are mostly limited to Leetcode easy problems. My peripheral knowledge needs a lot more work- many companies I&#x27;ve interviewed have rejected me for it. I know very little about most of them and rather out of date with frameworks. I need to get hired to begin with a training period on such knowledge before they expect me to be productive.<p>Also, I&#x27;m interested in startup or freelance opportunities. I have already been freelancing since 2011, and for smaller companies. Trying to pivot to a steady route that is also &quot;low pressure&quot; with the interviews.",
