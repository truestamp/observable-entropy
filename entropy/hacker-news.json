      "text": "For the first time in my life as a software developer I am tasked to remote in by VPN (sort of) to a server where ASP code resides.  I want to copy and paste the text locally so I can do things like searches for function names and such.  I can do it on the server perhaps but there is an issue with lag time.  Also, the screen I remote into with is small.<p>I would like very much to cut and paste the ASCII text.<p>I can cut and paste via screen shots and piece it together and then use OCR software to convert into text.  But that does not work.<p>Of course, cutting and pasting the ASCII does not work.  The shared system memory does not work.<p>Things tried:\n[LIST]\n[<i>]tried to copy and text ascii text.\n[</i>]tried to copy and past text as a screen grab to use with OCR but it did not work well.\n[&#x2F;LIST]<p>Now, not to get dark here, but, there IS some way to do this.  And there IS such a thing as &quot;friendly hacking&quot;.  I mean, I have all seen youtube videos of people dialing into a remote server and downloading content somehow.",
