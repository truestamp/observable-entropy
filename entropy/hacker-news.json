      "text": "Over the past many years I have tried to make new year resolutions on different aspects of life (health, finance, skills). I try to stick to it for a few weeks or months but then I give up. And rinse and repeat. The new year resolutions have helped me to some extent over the long run, but nothing has changed my life deeply or become integral to my life, in short not as effective as they could have been.<p>I want to know from HN community do people here make new year resolutions and if so what strategies do they use to stick to the resolutions and have they become a permanent part of their life.",
