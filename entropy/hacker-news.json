      "text": "I recently moved to a new house that has a radon mitigation system that was poorly installed. For example there was no pit underneath the foundation just some gravel. I know this because I had a plumbing issue and had to rip up the floor. The system is still running, as well as a ventilation fan to clear the air by the boiler but my numbers in my basement are still generally above 4.0. I don’t want to pay someone to fix this because I’m pretty handy and want to fix it myself. Has anyone done this or have any pointers for what I can look at to learn more about effective ways to mitigate radon in an older home?",

Linus  decided to write his own version control system because the people who wrote free software he thought was good enough for his purposes decided to start charging users money for the fruits of their labor.<p>By his own account, he spent a couple of weeks writing git and named it after himself.<p>Moving into WAG territory, the original GitHub team thought since Linus wrote it there&#x27;s got to be a pony in there somewhere. Evidently many other people did too. Eventually adults stepped in to monetize that and some of the original team got butthurt. The adults eventually made a pile selling out to M$ who recognized the operation is not about source code control, at all.<p>Git is very user unfriendly. It may solve Linus&#x27; problems, but it has caused a lot of pain when I expected it to solve mine.",
