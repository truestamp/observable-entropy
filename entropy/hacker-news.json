      "text": "<i>easylang</i> is a rather minimalistic simple programming language. Because of the clear syntax and semantics it is well suited as a teaching and learning language. Functions for graphic output and mouse input are built into the language.<p>The language is written in C and is open source. Main target platform is the web browser using WASM. However, it also runs natively in Windows and Linux.<p>The one-pass parser and compiler is quite fast. In the Web IDE, each time the Enter key is pressed, the program is parsed and formatted up to the current line.<p>The AST interpreter is fast, much faster than <i>CPython</i> for example.<p>The language is statically typed and has as data types numbers (floating point) and strings and resizeable arrays. Variables are not declared, the type results from the name (<i>number</i>, <i>string$</i>, <i>array[]</i>).<p>Uses: Learning language, canvas web applications, algorithms.<p>For example, I solved the <i>AdventOfCode</i> tasks with <i>easylang</i>.",
