      "text": "My name is Mark Amberg, Co-founder of Craspa, restaurant tech. I was watching an interview with Mr.Beast speaking on the success of content creators and he mention that a lot of successful content creators have 1 thing in common which is collaboration. However, to my knowledge, there aren&#x27;t many places, for founders to group meet or find other founders that aren&#x27;t well established. This is why I want to start a founders group of around 8 founders in the B2B space to collaborate with and grow.<p>If you or know someone interested in weekly&#x2F;bi-weekly zoom group meetings, focusing on growth, accountability, bouncing ideas&#x2F;tactics, and overall growth together, please drop your company&#x27;s website and I&#x27;ll check it out and reach out to you.<p>Must be no funding to no more than series A funding and have a working and market-ready product.",

      "text": "In 2018, MyFitnessPal had a data breach[1]. Just now, I got an email sent to me claiming to be a PayPal transaction with a giant <i>Cancel the Payment</i> button. I use Fastmail as an email provider with a unique email address for each account I sign up for. This scam email was sent to my MyFitnessPal email address. Of course, the scammers know I didn&#x27;t authorize this [fake] transaction and really badly want me to click that gigantic Cancel button. Don&#x27;t click it! Clicking it leads to a fake PayPal authentication screen where they will steal your credentials if you enter them.<p>Scam email: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;1hqQVyy<p>Fake PayPal authentication website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;yqoiEXW<p>Oftentimes, data acquired from breaches is not used immediately. Sometimes it can take months or years for the data to be sold to criminals that then organize scams such as this one.
