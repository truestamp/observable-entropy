      "text": "I&#x27;m actively working on a news shortening website. Trying to save you from clickbaits, save your time and save you from reading Bible-sized articles\nWhat I hate the most when reading news is reading Bible-size articles just to find the main point of the article. Usually journalists write a bunch of unnecessary information just to create 400+ long articles and position better on Google.<p>Worst of all are those clickbait titles or titles that tell you a portion of information just to make you intrigue and make you click on the article.<p>For me personally, it is very annoying and frustrating. I like to spend like 30 seconds tops on an article, I want to get the information as fast as possible and move on.<p>So with my [ExcerptDaily](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;excerptdaily.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;excerptdaily.com&#x2F;</a>) I&#x27;m trying to:<p>* Save people&#x27;s time<p>* Inform you as fast as possible<p>* Give you the main point of an article in 5 sentences<p>* Save you from clickbait or half clickbait titles<p>I wrote my own algorithm and tried a few of them, now I&#x27;m focusing on my own algorithm and making it better. I focused on the US market and CNN only so far, it is my ground zero.",

      "text": "Hi, I recently made a CLI tool that&#x27;s similar to `make`, but geared towards servers. There&#x27;s tons of software in this category (Ansible, Chef, Salt, Sup, etc.), but most of them are geared towards production-grade server management, which is a bit overkill I think when you&#x27;re just doing some `apt install &lt;package&gt;` or `sudo systemctl start &lt;unit&gt;` for your hobby projects. With this in mind, sake was born.",
