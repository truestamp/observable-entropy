      "text": "I am starting to take seriously finding a new job but don&#x27;t want to rock the boat at my current place of work unnecessarily.<p>I am obviously going to be applying directly but I wanted to tell my LinkedIn network that I was at least open to new roles to see if anyone had anything. The problem is if I post anything, it&#x27;ll be seen by my manager. We&#x27;re connected on LinkedIn and Twitter so if I post anything overtly about searching, hell know and may cause issues I don&#x27;t want yet.<p>Any advice on how to go about this? I don&#x27;t care if my manager knows I&#x27;m unhappy, we&#x27;ve talked about it at length. I&#x27;m just not wanting everyone to know I&#x27;ve got one foot out the door in case there isn&#x27;t anything better at this time.",
