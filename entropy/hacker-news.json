I&#x27;ve definitely spent a ton of time on stack overflow specifically for its efficiency of solving simple questions, but mainly it&#x27;s my favorite because of the rare answers that go on for paragraphs explaining the intricacies of some rando&#x27;s question that seem to stand out, at first, as being an unfit length for the question but end up leaving me wondering why this isn&#x27;t a full blown medium or html&#x2F;css-only-type-blog post.<p>Who makes these crazy awesome stack overflow answers? What&#x27;s their life look like? Are they just another eng in my company, and do I know any?",
