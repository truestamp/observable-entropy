      "text": "In almost all real-world instances - From individuals making personal decisions, to inter-governmental groups - whenever one is to try inferring meaning from data, Average seems to be the &#x27;natural&#x27; metric of choice. To me, a lot of them could be using Median for better decision-making, but that seems to be no one&#x27;s first choice.<p>From a sociological point of view, what is that?<p>A few points on why I feel Average is the dominant statistic (and counter-points):<p>* Median requires one to keep an indexed, sorted list. Average can be computed without needing order. _- This seems to be only a positive in computational sense, not real-world-decision-making sense. Governments can wait extra 10 minutes to calculate Median income instead of Average income._<p>* Average is simple for the Human Brain to make sense of",
