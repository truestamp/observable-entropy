      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;m working on an IoT platform that has to receive, transform, store and visualize IoT data in a user-friendly dashboard. I&#x27;m currently using the Azure stack (stream analytics, data lake, SQL server, Power BI) but I&#x27;m running into major limitations and bugs so I&#x27;m looking for new tools that will help me out.<p>We&#x27;re currently doing about 500M events per year, but this needs to scale WAY higher (the customer wants to retain detailed data for up to a year, but I question if that&#x27;s realistic and if that&#x27;s how others do it. Seems more sensible to me to aggregate data to compact it a bit). Whatever new setup I come up with has to be able to scale to at least 10B events per year, unless you all say it&#x27;s impossible and I should just not try to store&#x2F;visualize&#x2F;analyze so much data. But I don&#x27;t know what best-practices are.<p>I&#x27;m looking for ideas for what kind of tools I could use for storing the data, stream processing and for visualizing it all, and maybe some ideas for how they would work together.<p>Thanks a bunch in advance!",
