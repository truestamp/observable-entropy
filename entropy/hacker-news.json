      "text": "I&#x27;m trying myself in e-commerce with a small webshop, the product is rather niche, but I&#x27;m willing to switch to&#x2F;add another types of products too.\nCurrently, it is handcrafted vases, dishes and candles, maybe I&#x27;ll expand with 3d-printed stuff like figurines in the future.<p>Could you suggest me some books&#x2F;courses on webmarketing? Share you ecperience with different types of ads? And no, I&#x27;m not equating &quot;ads&quot; with &quot;marketing&quot;, though I&#x27;d like to be covered from both sides.<p>One interesting observation: there&#x27;s a supporting Instagram account with the products listed exactly as in webshop. Just tried both of the types of Ig ads (post and reel) - the conclusion is that noone really watches the posts, but the reels did get me just a few subscribers.<p>Any help is highly appreciated!",

      "text": "I would like to create a group that promotes RSS.<p>Regularly on HN we see threads about the apparent demise of the feed file as a technology and how sad it is. Despite the answers to those threads showing that RSS&#x2F;Atom is not dead at all, what is clear is that it is not in a great spot. Less sites support it, percent-wise a smaller amount of internet users knows what it is and how it might be of use, browsers dropped their integrations.<p>I have a plan on how to counteract this. It includes getting people together who feel that this technology is elemental for the open web and should be preserved. It then vaguely continues like this (not necessarily sorted by feasibility):<p>1. Open PRs for browsers with provided-by-us code to integrate RSS again, with UI elements that make existing feeds visible and supports subscribing via a feed reader<p>2. Run a site that can be used for this, that takes a &quot;I want to subscribe to a feed&quot;-request and presents RSS readers to do so.<p>3. Implement default feeds for CMS that are missing them.<p>4. Implement easy to use libraries for programming languages that might miss them.<p>5. Create a website that explains why this is important, that hosts or links to the specifications and that contains additional documentation.<p>It&#x27;s nothing I can do on my own, but I really think that if some people come together, that we could have a real influence on this development. Even if the browser integration step fails (which might be likely) there are alternative ways forward. And I&#x27;m sure there will be many more ideas on what could be done.<p>If this is of interest to you, consider joining https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;FosterRSS&#x2F;community.",
