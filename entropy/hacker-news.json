I&#x27;d love to give up my aging Android phone for something with a good camera, good battery life, and no Internet browser &#x2F; social media. I still need WhatsApp, Google Maps, Uber, and a few other basic apps for work, but I want to get rid of anything with the potential to keep me scrolling infinitely. Has anyone else succeeded in this task? Are there good modern phones which can be successfully locked down to such a degree?",
