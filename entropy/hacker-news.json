      "text": "Here is what happened. I owed the “MoneyLion” app, a pay-day advance app, a past-due balance of $85. This app is installed on my iPhone.<p>The cards on my Apple ID had insufficient funds to bill me at the time.<p>On Feb 20th I added a new payment method on my MacBook (My parents Credit Card) to purchase a $1 app on the MacOS App Store.<p>Somehow MoneyLion took it upon themselves to collect the due balance on Feb 21st off my parents Credit Card simply because it was a working payment method on my iCloud account.<p>But the weird thing is that this charge does not appear on my AppleID payments history! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reportaproblem.apple.com<p>Somehow this MoneyLion app billed my card through AppleID saved payment cards, but left no trace in the AppleID payment history.<p>I know it had to be collected through my AppleID because:<p>It was a brand new MacOS laptop that never had anything to do with MoneyLion where I typed in this card number. The only thing in common between my phone where the app is installed and my laptop is that both devices were signed into the same Apple account.<p>I am bewildered that somehow apps have a way to charge your AppleID payment methods silently and untraceably leaving no trace on AppleID payment history.<p>It seems likely they are abusing a glitch in the Apple ID payment system or have a special agreement with Apple to do this.<p>In any case, beware!",
