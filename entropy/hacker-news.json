Anything you could want has already been designed, built and distributed for sale. There was a before-and-after event, some catastrophic event, and literally nothing is usable now, because the people that made it are gone, everything has DRM software in it and trying to use it without a license (prohibitively expensive) or edit it is worth capital punishment in some justice-dispensing-robot&#x27;s brain somewhere, so we&#x27;re back to being basically in 1836, but poor and irradiated.<p>I&#x27;m not well versed in the science fiction literature, have you read such books? What are your favorites? Do you know of any that fit the above description?",
