I&#x27;ve tried multiple combinations for months, researched and paid people to look at the ads and suggest what I can do.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem: I only have a small budget I can afford and that is 15€ per day, per platform.<p>1. With Facebook, they say they sent more than double the clicks Analytics tells me they sent and the clicks that do pass through have an almost 100% bounce rate with average time spent on page of 0 seconds. For example, they say they sent 300 clicks in a week, but I only see 120-130 in Analytics.<p>2. With the same ad, on Reddit Ads, I see in Analytics 90-95% of the clicks they said they sent and the bounce rate is about 82%, with more than 3 minutes average sessions.<p>With both platforms I run an ad and then a retargeting ad. Until now, this was the only strategy that had relative success.<p>All the people that consulted on the ads said that with 15€ per day, Facebook gives 0 results, which I already saw and I find disappointing. The only explanation I can find is that on Facebook I only get bot clicks.<p>Are there any other platforms that are more suitable for my budget?",
