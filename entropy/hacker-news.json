      "text": "This is a request for help with FB and Insta accounts. I am aware this happens quite a bit, though not sure if it&#x27;s usually anything so completely unexplained. Any tips on how to approach this are appreciated.<p>No warning notice, just banned instantly from both Facebook and Instagram, which I use for marketing as an ISV and a coach. No real explanation.<p>Screenshots:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;savolai.net&#x2F;uncategorized-en&#x2F;banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-screenshots&#x2F;<p>In the facebook appeals form they request a photo of user identification such as passport. I&#x27;m not sure I feel comfortable sharing all the sensitive info on it. Is it i.e. okay to cover up my Finnish social security number ending part from this?<p>The whole process seems horribly broken. Is this normal?<p>Details:<p>On Friday night at around 9pm Finnish time (UTC+2) I was on my laptop. I switched to Facebook tab and it suddenly told me I had activity on facebook that goes against community guidelines.<p>I hadn&#x27;t posted anything this week, except as instagram stories that get synced to my coaching page, which hasn&#x27;t been closed. I don&#x27;t think I post anything very controversial, related to covid or otherwise.<p>In the first screen I saw (screenshot in above url)\nthey asked me to push a big blue button to indicate I disagree with the decision.<p>They sent me and I received a SMS verification code but the web ui still said sending the code failed so I couldn&#x27;t enter the code. After trying a couple of times, they say I&#x27;ve tried too many times and there is a delay of 24h. Even after the 24h passed, I still get this.<p>Every time I enter now on my cell phone, I get this screen that claims to show the violating content I have posted, except the photo grid only shows blank grey rectangles. Pressing the &quot;Continue&quot; button gives a grey spinner and does nothing.<p>Today the time at which they claim I posted those violating images had changed. Originally it was 8:51pm  on Friday night. Now they said it was 1:51 am yesterday, i.e on Saturday morning, by which time the account had already been suspended for several hours.<p>Accessing on my cell phone I managed to get the instagram verification process started. Just now I found another form where I could give my userid&#x2F;phone number and a scanned photo of personal ID.<p>My business pages are still up, but I have no way of accessing them.<p>Thanks for any pointers on how to proceed!",
