      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a software dev for 15~ years professionally and over the course of my career have moved from front end to full stack and back to front end depending on the project. I make multiple 6 figures and by all accounts could be considered &quot;successful&quot;.<p>My most recent gig after working for years in React and Angular I&#x27;ve had to move to a new framework (Vue) due to project requirements that I did not write. As a senior contributor I&#x27;m expected to handle the complex stuff but after five months on the project I feel fatigued - like I just don&#x27;t care enough to work on this project. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s JS framework fatigue or the project itself or even depression. But I feel like after 15 years of doing this I&#x27;m getting &quot;dumber&quot; to the point where I question the most basic things in coding. It&#x27;s rather discouraging.<p>My boss is pretty cool and has kept an open door to let them know if I want to switch projects but I&#x27;m worried (without evidence) that if I say anything I&#x27;ll be put on something even &quot;harder&quot; when I can&#x27;t bring myself to write some simple JS these days.<p>Anyone ever experience this? I&#x27;m in my mid 30s.",
