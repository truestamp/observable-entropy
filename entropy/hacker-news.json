      "text": "Hey HN,<p>Very longtime lurker who finally has something to share!<p>Over the last couple of years I&#x27;ve found it pretty difficult to organise one to ones with my colleagues, and when I do get some time with them, the conversation often feels a little unstructured and not as valuable as it could be.<p>I built Pontoon to try and solve these problems, and maximise the quality of the one to one time I have. I&#x27;ve only just launched (I literally pressed the button yesterday!), and so there&#x27;s only a few simple features so far:\n- Meeting planner\n- Actions\n- Video meetings\n- Calendar sync<p>There&#x27;s plenty more in the pipeline but I wanted to open Pontoon up to everyone and start getting some feedback from real users. You can sign up for a 30 day trial with no card details, and if you&#x27;re enjoying it just ping me an email at rhys@meetpontoon.com telling me you&#x27;re from HN and I&#x27;ll add some credit to your account.<p>Thanks a lot",
