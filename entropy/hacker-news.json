Typical consumers don’t care about “enterprise” grade security. I’ve thought about double dipping as I’ve seen a ton of openings in my wheelhouse. I do have some moral issues with double dipping. Currently I have full control of my schedule and it’s very lite on meetings. I could probably handle 2 9-5 jobs simultaneously. I worry about employment verifications and how my current employer could find out via background checks or credit reports.<p>Anyways looking for any advice from anyone who currently or formally double dipped and or finding after hours work.",
