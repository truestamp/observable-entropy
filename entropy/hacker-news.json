      "text": "For any Hetzner Cloud customers who may be interested: I have released v0.5.4 of a tool I created [1] to manage Kubernetes clusters in Hetzner Cloud. This release adds support for multi zonal clusters for higher availability as well as the ability to specify extra args for each Kubernetes component, so that you can enable feature flags and things like that.<p>For those not familiar with this tool: it&#x27;s a tool to quickly create production clusters in Hetzner Cloud using k3s, so creating a cluster takes only a couple of minutes or less.<p>For those not familiar with Hetzner: it&#x27;s a German provider that offers an awesome service, servers with great performance and reliability for a fraction of the price the other providers charge. If you mostly need compute and not the many services the bigger providers offer, you can save quite a bit of money with this provider. They have 2 locations in Europe (in Germany and one in Finland) as well as one location in the US (Ashburn, Virginia).<p>Looking for feedback and suggestions of features I could add. Thanks!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vitobotta&#x2F;hetzner-k3s",
