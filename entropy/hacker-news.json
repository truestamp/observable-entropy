I fear however that most companies won&#x27;t consider me,<p>a) because I&#x27;m a bit rusty or too old (35+)\nb) I&#x27;m probably not up to date with the latest technologies.\nc) I&#x27;ll likely fail &quot;LeetCode&quot; style interviews...<p>Has anyone done something similar and can give me some tipps?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind learning something new (e.g. node.js) and my gut feeling tells me that I should probably look into learning LeetCode-like exam questions.",
