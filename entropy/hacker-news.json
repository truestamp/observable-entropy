      "text": "Hey, We are building a grocery delivery platform, where you could get up to 100% discount on groceries, vegetables, meat &amp; fish.<p>But when I talk this, that we can provide up to 100% discounts (I mean free), no one is ready to believe it.<p>We do that through invitations (referral marketing). When you invite your friends and when they make a purchase through us, you get a percentage of the sale, as wallet balance. It&#x27;s not 1 time, but whenever they purchase you get a referral percentage for the sale. We provide 1% of the total sales as referral commission, which is not huge at all. But when the volume increases, that becomes big for the customer.<p>For example: let&#x27;s say you buy $400 worth of groceries every month.\nSo when you refer, one of your friends, who also buy $400 worth of products through us, you get a $4 (1%) instant discount on your next purchase.<p>If you were able to refer, 100 such customers who buy $400 worth of groceries every month, you will be able to get $400 discounts every month, that&#x27;s a 100% discount for your monthly groceries.<p>100 referrals might seem hard to reach. But we help our customers through educational content&#x2F;videos to reach that level using simple social media and online marketing techniques, by providing all their customized marketing materials.<p>------------------\nI would like to know what&#x27;s your take on this idea. It&#x27;s a simple idea.",

It might not be in 5 or 10 years, but I believe it will happen long before my retirement.<p>To evade the fallout on salary and job opportunities, what are things one can do to prepare? Are there any skills that make one less susceptible to AI replacement? Any fields within engineering (or engineering adjacent) one should get into?",
