      "text": "Received an email from ACM<p>As of July 1, 2022, you will no longer have to access the O’Reilly Learning platform as a benefit of your ACM membership. Despite our best efforts, O’Reilly Media is unwilling to continue to license their content to ACM for members. Please finish your reading&#x2F;training by 11:59 PM ET on June 30, 2022. If you wish to continue accessing O’Reilly Learning past this date, you will have to contact O’Reilly and purchase a license directly.<p>We regret that O’Reilly is not willing to continue providing this service to ACM Members and hope that you will continue to enjoy other benefits of ACM membership, such as our Skillsoft collection (with thousands of online books and courses from publishers such as Manning Publications and No Starch Press), as well as ACM TechTalks, the ACM ByteCast series, and more. All of these can be found in the ACM Learning Center.<p>ACM will continue to explore new partnerships to deliver additional professional development benefits and other opportunities for lifelong learning.<p>Sincerely,\nACM Member Services<p>Is there any cheaper way to access O&#x27;Reilly Learning Platform?",
