Did they websearch alternatives?<p>But besides that, other things went down as a result of people trying alternatives (they flooded Twitter and brought it down ddos style), and flooded gmail and brought it down.<p>Basically kind of giant reroute of internet traffic and activity.<p>Corporate meetings on the affected platforms went down. How was business affected?<p>IoT devices went down. What vulnerabilities were shown?<p>Other countries, not using FB et all, were probably not affected. What did we learn?",
