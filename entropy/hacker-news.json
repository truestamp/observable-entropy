      "text": "Good day beautiful HN<p>For me, offsetting your carbon footprint is a super quick and simple way to make a difference for a small cost without having to change your way of life.<p>Personally I&#x27;m veggie, rarely fly or drive, and am conscious of my footprint in my day to day life - yet I&#x27;m starting to get stuck on where to improve next (without radically changing my lifestyle) so for me carbon offsets are an easy win.<p>I know it&#x27;s not an end-all solution to climate change, but if everybody did so I think it would make a huge difference. Especially if they are verifiable (evidence of removal), additional (wouldn&#x27;t have happened without the offset) and transparent (can be audited).<p>I&#x27;m wondering what this community thinks.",
