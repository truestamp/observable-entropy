Obviously, I cant compare larger sets due to the time complexity of existing algorithms.<p>So my question is, what is the best path forward?<p>I&#x27;ll solve a few more of your sets below for more proof, although some sets&#x2F;goals require more memory than my computer has.<p>For now I wont share the details of the algorithm for obvious reasons.<p>Some other interesting notes:\n- Goal=150: Set=(1...100), there are 19,378,091 subsets that sum to 150 (94 seconds to compute)",
