It would be useful if respectable long-term users with high karma could see who flagged posts that get flagged, particularly when the submission is amassing upvotes and discussion. Otherwise, this place is no longer any better than reddit where astroturfing, gaslighting, and brigading are now the norm.<p>These high-karma users would then be able to vet flags and remove flags that may be coordinated. We need to face the reality that there can be coordinated flagging that is designed to wedge an ideological bent into the flow of the conversation.",
