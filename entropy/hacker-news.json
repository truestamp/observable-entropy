      "text": "I&#x27;ve been reading with intense sadness about the evacuations of Russians and Ukrainians during this conflict. Even if they get out of harms way, they need to find a new place to live in the short term and then find alternative sources of income in the long term if their company is Russian.<p>Could we create a technology solution that aids people affected by this conflict in a way that helps both short and long term problems?<p>Fraud seems like an obvious issue. But when people post here, I can read their profile and see their GitHub contributions and know they are in my community. So I feel like we could help people in a way that limits fraud.<p>I&#x27;m feeling very helpless about this war. I&#x27;ll happily contribute $500 directly to people if they need short term income or whatever, so please point me to those who need help right now and I&#x27;ll do it. It&#x27;s not a lot (I&#x27;m in a startup and don&#x27;t have consistent income right now) but this world seems so crazy right now and I want to take some action to help.",
