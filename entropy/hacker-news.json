      "text": "Hey :)<p>I developed a software which is a plain simple monolithic web application. Pretty basic: ASP.NET with angular and SQL Server as a database. Currently I use one windows server for each customer. I do this to make sure, that no software bug accidently shows data of customer A to customer B (privacy is the most important priority).<p>I am considering containerizing the application. From what I have heard, the handling and updating of the software is easier.<p>Do you know of any good resources to learn more about this topic? I am still missing the conceptual basics.<p>I appreciate any help you can give me! Regards!",
