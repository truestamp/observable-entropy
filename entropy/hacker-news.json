      "text": "I&#x27;ve been playing with cross platform windows&#x2F;linux Kubernetes clusters recently and have had endless problems with installer scripts misconfiguring networking by using the wrong NIC etc.<p>I got frustrated with the tooling on windows to debug container networking so I built a tool that attempts to stitch together the HNS (Host Network Service) &amp; HCS (Host Compute Service) resources into a tree that shows the relationship between configs. You can also search over it to find the networking impacting your containers or launch the windows built in packet capture tool to create a network trace you can open in Wireshark for analysis.<p>I&#x27;m not a desktop app developer so it&#x27;s pretty rough around the edges and I&#x27;ve only really tested on Windows 11 and Server 2019.",

      "text": "There have been various discussions of Literate Programming on HN, a technology Knuth said was one of his best ideas.<p>The book &quot;Lisp In Small Pieces&quot; by Christian Queinnec is, in my opinion, the best example of a literate program available.<p>The ideas are developed very, very carefully. The explanations in the paragraphs are clear and to-the-point. Actual code implementing the idea appears after each explanation, essentially using code like a physics book uses equations.<p>Christian introduces ideas, like environment variables or continuations, in simple steps. He also discusses alternatives, their pros and cons.<p>If you know of other literate programs please post a comment.",
