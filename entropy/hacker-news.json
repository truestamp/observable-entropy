      "text": "Hi all<p>Have tried the below to get macbook pro 16&quot; battery to last longer than 3 hours.<p>For a laptop that is supposed to last 9-11 hours this is way off the mark.<p>List of things that I tried and that failed:<p>1. Turbo Boost Switcher app - turns off CPU turboboost\n2. Closing onedrive and google drive apps\n3. gfxcardstatus app - shows you if you using discrete or integrated GPU (integrated better for battery)\n4. Use without external monitor\n5. Close all inactive apps\n6. Only browse with Safari\n7. System Settings&gt;Energy Saver I checked the box &quot;Automatic Graphics switching&quot;\n8. System Settings&gt;Bluetooth&gt;Advanced&gt;Uncheck &quot;Allow Bluetooth devices wake this computer&quot;\n9. System Settings&gt;Notifications&gt;Turn on Do Not Disturb&gt;When Display is sleeping&#x2F;When Screen is locked.\n10. Reset SMC\n11. Reset NVRAM &#x2F; PRAM\n12. Use activity monitor to check battery usage (nothing jumps out at me, and no processes are draining batteries)<p>Does anyone have anything that actually works?<p>This is a very common issue all over the internet<p>Thanks.... I can&#x27;t go to the Apple Store in my country there isn&#x27;t one.",
