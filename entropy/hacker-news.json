      "text": "Hi everyone,\nI&#x27;m the creator of dstack, a tool that makes it easier to train models in the cloud. Our tool allows extending it with custom providers to support different languages, frameworks, etc.<p>All the built-in providers are also open-source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dstackai&#x2F;dstack<p>Today, we&#x27;ve released a new update that extends the capabilities of dstack beyond training models, and now also allows users to quickly build and share apps with Streamlit, Gradio, and FastAPI in the cloud – in just a few clicks.<p>Also, similar to apps, it&#x27;s possible to run dev environments with the required hardware and data access also in one command from the Terminal. All you have to do is to link your own AWS account to run commands.<p>Currently, we support VS Code, and JupyterLab but plan to support more.<p>Invite everyone to give it a try and share their thoughts. Happy to discuss the approach and what would be great to have in terms of other features!<p>Blog post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.dstack.ai&#x2F;introducing-apps-and-dev-environments<p>P.S.: Currently, it&#x27;s possible to run models and apps only in the configured cloud. If you&#x27;d like the tool to also allow you to run it locally, and if you would like this part to be open-source too, please leave comments!",
