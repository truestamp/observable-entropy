      "text": "My first idea is Hacker News, unfortunately with the flow in &#x2F;new it tends to be dropped fast if it&#x27;s a niche question.<p>In this case, I&#x27;m looking for a scraping API that can give me structured data from a comment thread that&#x27;s unstructured (like HN, for those who haven&#x27;t looked, comment&#x27;s aren&#x27;t nested in the source). Maybe something that uses computer vision to determine structure?<p>Anyway, while an answer to that question would be great, this question is to ask about where would you go for such questions (subreddits, somewhere on StackExchange, other forums?)<p>Thank you all very much",

      "text": "Luke-warm take I&#x27;ve been pondering: Business ideas don&#x27;t have to come from seeking out a specific problem to solve, and they don&#x27;t have to start out in a niche market.<p>Certain ideas just need to be well executed consistently to be successful. A few examples.<p>General interest content &amp; newsletters like The Skimm, RocaNews, and The Hustle. You could argue they&#x27;re solving the problem of people needing concise news updates. But I think they were successful more because they were well-written and engaging for a long period of time.<p>Kid&#x27;s toys, like the Nugget Pillows or basically any trendy new toy that comes onto the market. There is definitely no shortage of kids toys. These succeed more because they&#x27;re solid products paired with quality marketing.<p>Home goods products. These are usually just nice looking or nice-smelling things that people like to have around their homes and are willing to pay for.<p>Popular social media accounts like Friday Beers or any meme account. These accounts aren&#x27;t solving a niche problem, they&#x27;re just providing entertainment.<p>Sure, you can come up with a general problem that each of these solves. A meme account is a solution for boredom, or children&#x27;s toys are a solution for kids needing to be entertained. But when the creators of these things generated the idea initially, were they really focusing hard on the question of: what niche-market problem can I solve? Or did they just come up with a good, simple product and execute it well?<p>Maybe being some form of entertainment or content is the common link with all these examples? Not totally sure. But overall, I think there are lots of exceptions and limitations to the common advice about generating business ideas. I&#x27;m sure there are some considerations I&#x27;m not thinking of.<p>If so, roast me.<p>(Originally posted this on my twitter account that I recently started: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;WoodworkStartup)",
