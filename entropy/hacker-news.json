      "text": "4 days ago(a Saturday!), I received a completely cold email from a Chewy.com recruiter telling me &quot;we&#x27;re seeking passionate and driven engineers to join...&quot;<p>As far as I know I&#x27;ve never expressed <i>any</i> interest or given them any of my information outside of being a customer for several years. However, they continued in their email asking me to provide them with lots of information about myself without actually telling me a single actionable piece of information about any role.<p>Regardless, I replied (on a Sunday!), telling them (paraphrased) &quot;I did find it strange as to why they were reaching out to me specifically. But even so, I do like Chewy from my experiences with them as a company. So I would definitely entertain the idea.&quot; I gave them some <i>basic</i> information about myself(YoE, Education, Tech focus) and asked the following questions (with some personal information removed)<p><pre><code>  - What are the pay ranges on your senior positions?\n  - Is remote a possibility? \n  - What does your overall interview process look like? \n</code></pre>\nDays later, no response. What&#x27;s the rationale with doing this? Especially when you&#x27;re cold-emailing candidates whose information you got from.. where? I already have a bad taste in my mouth from what the norm is for modern hiring practices. But, this simply goes above and beyond what could be construed as an opinion. This absolutely should not be tolerated. Why would a company be so shortsighted as to actively sabotage their image by behaving this way?<p>And unfortunately, Chewy is not the only company behaving this way. They were just my breaking point from seeing this happen multiple times.",
