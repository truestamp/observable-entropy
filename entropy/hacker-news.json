      "text": "Based in UK. I started a new position at a company that trains people in various cloud stuff (Azure, AWS, Salesforce). For the first 12 weeks, we (the cohort) study and gain some certs and then after that, we get placed with a client to work on some projects.<p>However, after 3 weeks and 1 cert later, we were told that the company can&#x27;t find enough clients and we may need to look for other jobs soon. We still have about 5 - 6 weeks left for training and another cert to attain. If the company can&#x27;t find any clients in 6-10 weeks, we will most likely be let go (their words).<p>The problem is that most of us cannot go back to our previous jobs because the way we left wasn&#x27;t ideal - the training started way too early and we had to leave during our notice periods. On top of that, certs are kinda useless without the experience to back them.<p>What would you advise us to do in this situation?",
