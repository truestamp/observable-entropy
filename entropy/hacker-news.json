      "text": "I only recently came across the article about Uber&#x27;s migration from Postgres 9.2 to MySQL and the various issues that were raised about Postgres. I&#x27;m curious what changes have been made to Postgres since then to deal with the issues around write amplification and inefficient replication. I&#x27;m planning to read the release notes for the major versions that have been released since that article (11, 12, and 13), but I&#x27;d appreciate if anyone who is more familiar with these details can provide some insight into what&#x27;s improved and what&#x27;s stayed the same",
