Sometimes a client requires a mobile app, so I stich together an app by following tutorials here and there, even though most of my stuff works, they are by no means professionally made, nor scalable or maintainable, I just need to do these jobs in order to get some cash flowing on, otherwise I would have nothing to depend on.\nI have gotten my CS degree last year when I was 24, and currently I have a BSc in CS. I have been coding 10 years ago, but to this date I haven&#x27;t built something that I can be proud of!<p>I am stuck in a rut trying to specialize in a niche and keep on improving myself on that particular area.<p>I have tried Frontend Web Development but quite honestly I really hate working with CSS, it&#x27;s not the syntax that I struggle with, it&#x27;s the fact that making a site responsive really really is something I hate, I mostly hate working with UIs.<p>When I was in college I really loved working on the console, I built great apps using the console, and I quite enjoyed what I was doing! We were learning C++ at the time, and working on the console made me think about my logic, my code, my idea, instead of sweating about the design, or how a button looks, or how to make text appear good on all screen sizes.<p>I want to try out Native mobile development but I am not sure whether it would be the right choice for me or not.<p>I am stuck, and there&#x27;s so much on my mind that I want to speak here but I can&#x27;t explain them easily without going too much into the details.<p>I really want a hand guys, and would be willing to answer or comment on any ideas or questions you might have!<p>EDIT: Sometimes I also think coding might not be for me aswell! Maybe I made the wrong choice, but there are times that I enjoy coding, especially when someone gives me a problem or an assignment to solve.",
