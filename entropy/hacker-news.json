      "text": "I need a fast approach to learn Python to be able to read and understand undocumented code, and able to start writing unit tests. I&#x27;m not an expert programmer. Started my journey with Java, worked on couple of micro services then moved to Javascript &amp; Typescript. I&#x27;m sure the average programming experience here is way more than mine hence asking your kind help to guide me and share your fav resources. All links and comments are highly appreciated. Thank you in adv. HN Community!",
