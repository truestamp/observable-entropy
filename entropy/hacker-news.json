      "text": "Hi,<p>I’m trying to figure out how billing might work for a potential subscription-based SAAS product.<p>Questions in mind include:\n1. What to charge for? Bandwidth? Storage? Other considerations?\n2. How to collect payment? Is Stripe a good option? What else do I need on the backend?\n3. How much to charge? Expenses + desired profit? Research competition.\n4. How to charge? Establishing tiers seems to be a common practice. Free, Personal, Business, Big, Gigantic. Does this simplify billing? Or is it more of a promotional thing, and establishing a single charge rate is simpler?\n5. What other questions am I not asking?<p>Any advice or references would be appreciated.<p>Thank you!",

      "text": "So, someone built Blog Surf[0] and I spent my morning weaving through various blogs (since it has a directory), and first thing that caught my eye was that for every 5 blogs I checked, only 1 had comments open on article pages.<p>If I look at posts like this one[1] and this one also[2] - these are extremely detailed articles (very interesting too), but no comments? I am not pointing my finger towards the authors, either.<p>It&#x27;s just weird that commenting is being pushed either to Twitter or email.<p>What do you think about this?<p>I fully understand that blog comments can be a pain in the butt to moderate when the average Joe just starts leaving &quot;Thanks!&quot; with a link to their website. But, it&#x27;s perfectly normal to remove the ability for anyone to link back to their website.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30844149<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wattenberger.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;css-cascade<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joshwcomeau.com&#x2F;css&#x2F;understanding-layout-algorithms&#x2F;",
