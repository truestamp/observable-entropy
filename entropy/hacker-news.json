It denies planning to invade.<p>The tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine&#x27;s southern Crimea peninsula and backed a bloody rebellion in the eastern Donbas region.<p>Moscow accuses the Ukrainian government of failing to implement the Minsk agreement - an international deal to restore peace to the east, where Russian-backed rebels control swathes of territory and at least 14,000 people have been killed since 2014.",
