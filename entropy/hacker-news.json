I am 100% confident that my password has not changed, but the developers changed the way passwords are handled.<p>In the past, my password would work on Chrome, but would fail to work on Mobile. I opened an issue and it was ignored.<p>Now my master password does not work anywhere (APART FROM THS LAPTOP and I was lucky to export my passwords.)<p>So heres a warning to all. Do not use BitWarden, they handle passwords incorrectly and you may lose all your passwords if they decide to randomly change password handling.<p>Possible Problem: They truncate passwords before sending to server? IDK at what length they truncate.<p>Has anyone else dealt with this and do you possibly know at what length they started truncating passwords?",
