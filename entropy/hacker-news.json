      "text": "Hi HN.<p>I have a SaaS that has quite a few small and big customers. I am now in the process of negotiating terms with another potential big customer. And they want an SLA for support. Their suggestion on emergency incidents is 30 minutes response 24&#x2F;7.<p>The nature of the service tells me it&#x27;s not going to be any emergency incidents, but I don&#x27;t like to put it there in writing. I am one person, and I love to sleep.<p>It&#x27;s also not suggested this would cost them extra, but I will for sure charge for the SLA separately.<p>So 2 questions:\n- What would you state as emergency response time?\n- What would you charge?<p>Thanks for any and all answers!",
