However, the mere act of analyzing the app &#x2F; code would basically be working. I know in other fields, a quote is usually given for free. For example, inviting over a contractor to evaluate a site plan.<p>So, should I pull the code, run the application, analyze the requirements and then submit a proposal or request payment to even begin looking at it?",
