      "text": "I bought a 40&quot; TV from Amazon by accident, as I meant to buy the 50&quot;. I immediately bought the 50&quot; and started a return process for the 40&quot; (unopened). They sent me a shipping label and said that Hermes (UK partner) will come pick it up the next business day between 8AM and 8PM but &quot;an adult must be present&quot;. So I stayed home all day.<p>Nobody ever came. I told customer service, they set a new day, and then it happened again. I asked if I could drop it off (there is a drop-off location down the street from my house) and they keep saying &quot;unfortunately Hermes pickup is the only return option for this item&quot;. We have set a third date but I doubt it will happen.<p>I feel &quot;damned if I do, damned if I don&#x27;t&quot;. I really don&#x27;t see how this refund is going to happen, never mind the fact that not everyone has the ability to stay home all day, multiple times. This feels like gaslighting to me.<p>Has anybody ever encountered this? What should I do?",
