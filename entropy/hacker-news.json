It has been a few months and I think this not a problem for a lot of people. \nBefore I pivot to something else (a resume builder&#x2F; or a professional profile creator)\nI wanted to ask you what was&#x2F;is your biggest pain point&#x2F; problem while searching for jobs recently.<p>Anything app&#x2F;website solution that you wish had existed. Maybe either someone on HN or I could build something to help you with it.<p>Please state your experience level with your problem. It would help in creating a solution.<p>Thanks!",
