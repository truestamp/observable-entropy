      "text": "This is one of the craziest stories from my user interviews.<p>Last week, I was talking to one of our users to get feedback on our idea &amp; product.<p>She was an UI&#x2F;UX designer at a well-known start-up. She joined the start-up 8 months back.<p>She said, “I was the most junior member in my team, so my manager asked me to take notes of our daily catch-up meetings and share notes with others”. Initially, she kind of enjoyed taking notes but after a couple of months, she felt undervalued.<p>She mentioned, “It was like I’m not the part of team discussion, couldn’t share my ideas or views since I was busy taking notes.”<p>One day she confronted her manager and shared her views. His manager said I used to take notes in my early days too. What’s an issue?<p>She said, “I couldn’t take it anymore and started applying to other companies”. Last month she joined another start-up.<p>Luckily, an intern takes notes for everyone here. She said, “I shared instaminutes.com with him as soon as I got to know about it. I don’t want him to face the same situation as I did.”<p>To be honest, I didn’t know that we are helping people to this extent with Instaminutes.<p>Please like and share if you think a person should be given the chance to work as per their area of interest not something they don’t like doing, for e.g., taking meeting notes.<p>Please share your story in comment if you faced any similar situation.",
