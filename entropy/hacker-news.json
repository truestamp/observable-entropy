How common are these vulnerabilities? Have there been any security breaches due to these vulnerabilities?<p>PS - I am ideating on creating a 2FA method using public-key cryptography. To login, you just scan the QR code from my authenticator and enter your phone&#x27;s pin or use Face&#x2F;Touch ID. This uses two factors so, first it ensures that the users posses the phone and second it ensures that the user knows the passcode or has Touch&#x2F;Face ID.  Please let me know if you have any feedback on this idea and if this solves the problems with SMS.",
