      "text": "I want to write events to a calendar, keep them up to date and perhaps cancel them on reasonably short notice. While supporting any calendar app (not just Google Calendar).<p>How have you solved this in the past (or present)?\nIs there a service&#x2F;project that handles this smoothly?<p>My gut tells me that this problem has been solved many, many times before, and that someone may have written a service for it, but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything.<p>The obvious choice seems to be the open formats: CalDAV, iCalendar etc. But I read nothing but bad things about integration with the likes of Google Calendar. From data loss to 12-24 hour delays in syncing.<p>So that pushes me to API integration. But integrating with every calendar API out there seems like a never-ending job.<p>Any insights and help are welcome.<p>GCal data loss:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;evertpot.com&#x2F;google-carddav-issues&#x2F;<p>GCal delays: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.cheqroom.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;1502123-why-is-my-google-calendar-sync-slow-or-not-updating-at-all",
