I&#x27;ve also been blind to things happening in the outside world for the past 5-6 years, so I probably missed a decent chunk of how modern web &#x2F; service development is done.<p>I don&#x27;t want to constrain the problem space, anything from systems programming to data science is on the table, so throw me something interesting!",

There’s zero money in that.<p>What I need is basically what the person in the above thread does - 10 hours a week would be amazing, but I don’t want to feel like I’m scamming my employer to get it. Keeping up some pretence of work doesn’t seem like a good idea ethically or for my own mental health.<p>I don’t need a big salary, I can quite easily live on 30-40k.<p>I’m at the beginning of my career as a developer. Reading the linked thread I kind of despair at the fact that hardly anyone seems willing to give part time contracts when it seems a lot of developers don’t work full time anyway. Are there ways to do this legitimately as a developer, or do you basically have to be in a big company where you can coast?",
