      "text": "Since I can&#x27;t seem to stop unloading Ask HN&#x27;s here, I&#x27;m starting to wonder if there are perhaps more constructive ways of channeling my burning desire of asking people questions, maybe like podcasts or interviews or something?<p>Come to think of it, I&#x27;ve always loved to dig professors&#x27; brains during their office hours way back in university and just get inspired by their passion for their subject. And whenever there were particularly interesting speakers at conferences, I would dream of introducing myself and talking to them to soak up their wisdom.<p>But for all these cases, not only was I reluctant to continue the conversations because I was shy and nervous about it all, but also because I didn&#x27;t actually know what I wanted to ask them. I had no questions in my head for them. I just knew that they are wise people that I would like to learn from.<p>For the Ask HN questions, most of them are self-serving in that they are questions I personally am curious about, many of which just spawn naturally as I poke around HN and think about my own endeavors.<p>But with interviews&#x2F;podcasts, I would think the focus would be different? There would be some theme, I&#x27;m sure, but of what? The subjects they are known for, sure, but that seems a bit narrow?<p>I don&#x27;t really have much ideas here, because it&#x27;s always just been a fantasy, so I never got down to figuring out which questions to ask. Or is it the other way around, that because I couldn&#x27;t think of questions, I could never bring the thought into reality... (drawing blank)<p>Does anyone know how interviewers and podcasters decide on their questions? How do they go about inviting the interviewees anyway? I&#x27;ve looked into this before but didn&#x27;t get anything constructive to work with.<p>And, beyond interviews and podcasts, are there other ways of tapping into this desire to ask people questions?<p>PS. Another note here, is that I&#x27;m completely lost for words or ideas when I talk to people <i>in person</i>. I only come up with good questions when I&#x27;ve had time alone to churn through it. So this constraints stuff for sure.",
