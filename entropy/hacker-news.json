I just became a permanent resident and so have a lot more options open to me.<p>I don’t want to build the next hot startup, make a billion dollars or anything of the sort. I have a great job and my employer is pretty cool about moonlighting as long as there are no conflicts and it doesn’t affect my work. I want to commit 1-2 hours a day and some weekends — all from home — to try and build an alternate income stream, partially for the experience and partially to earn some “fun money”.<p>I am skilled in all things tech and programming, but that’s about it. Has anyone had any luck in this area, or have stories to share?",
