My goal is to grow revenue first and after crossing some threshold of revenue start hiring people. I want to grow it into a business that I work on for the next 10-20 years. I would like to know what startup founders on HN would do in this scenario. A couple questions on my mind:<p>1. What are the top 3 things to focus on at the moment to drive up revenue -- product improvements, customer connection, marketing, etc.?\n2. Is applying to YC recommended?\n3. Is TinySeed helpful at this stage?",
