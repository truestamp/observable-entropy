      "text": "Hi, i&#x27;m an SRE who recruits other SRE&#x27;s for placement into interesting startups. In addition to the standard stuff, requirements such as DevOps, Automation, Kubernetes, Cloud Native, AWS, etc. I&#x27;m looking for people with reliability engineering experience in at least one of the following: Aerospace, Space, Telecom, RF communications, Autonomous vehicles. Any suggestions on where to locate people with these dual&#x2F;hybrid skillsets? e.g. job boards, message boards, and the like? If you have such hybrid skills, where do you go to look for interesting positions? any info would be much appreciated! thx",
