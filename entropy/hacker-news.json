Add a vague Timeline when it was written&#x2F;posted here.\n2. If you remember anything about the author, mention it.\n3. You can mention what kind of discussions happened in HN Threads of the topic.\n4. Write whatever you remember about the blog.<p>I&#x27;m submitting the threads I want to find below as an example.",
