      "text": "There is much discussion of the twitter deal and about bots in social media, what percentage of user accounts are bots, etc. It occurred to me that if that case gets into the courts there will need to be a definition of what a bot is or isn&#x27;t in order to ascertain percentages of user accounts.<p>What is your definition for a social media bot? Does it include the number of humans able to use a single account (e.g. customer service)? Does it include intent behind the account (e.g. product announcements)?  With the anonymity of online personas, how can someone determine bot-or-not?",

      "text": "Phones that can&#x27;t get software updates are more at risk of becoming targets for malware. Many phones only get software updates for a small number of years, often three years or less. Usually they get only a short time of firmware updates, a somewhat longer time of first-party bugfixes, then merely app fixes and possibly third-party ROM fixes.<p>Yet modern phone hardware is often still plenty fast enough for everyday use when the updates dry up.<p>Hence my question: what is the actual real-world danger of not updating your phone? Did anything ever happen to you or your phone because it wasn&#x27;t updated?",
