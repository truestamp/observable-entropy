      "text": "I am launching a side project with a few other YC, TechStars &amp; 500 alums called YC Rejects. The idea is to help founders applying to any incubator with advice and support so they can get in. I was rejected twice from YC myself. If you’re interested, please check out the website and share the link with founders you know or share your story below. We aim to help everyone who applies within 24h. If you’d like to mentor some of these companies, you can also sign up online!<p>The website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycrejects.co<p>Read about why I am doing this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lnkd.in&#x2F;gMaQB4EC",
