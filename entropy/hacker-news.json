Feel getting pretty large&#x2F;complex yaml files when deploying decent size infrastructure.<p>How do people feel just using AWS SDK or other cloud SDK to write your own deployment tools? Since it is pure code, it is easy to refactor and test.<p>I did some prototype building DataPunch project (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datapunchorg&#x2F;punch) to deploy Data Infrastructure using AWS Go SDK. It provides one click command like “punch install SparkOnEKS” which will automatically deploy a ready-to-use Apache Spark environment on AWS.<p>Want to seek feedbacks and see whether other people have similar ideas?<p>Thanks,\nBo",
