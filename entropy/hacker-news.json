      "text": "I wondered if you could help me with this one. I would prefer to use a lawyer but I&#x27;ve left this quite late, so I&#x27;d like to hear others experiences (not legal advice obviously).<p>I&#x27;m currently negotiating an executive-level employment offer letter for a high-growth startup. I&#x27;ve secured a double-trigger clause in the offer letter but the wording is limited to my termination within 12 months after a sale. The VP HR implied there was flexibility to give more to me within this clause. I&#x27;m unfamiliar with double triggers and have read online that the other pieces I might ask for are:<p>- a short pre-closing window (3 months or shorter) to counter any preemptive termination by the company to avoid a payout<p>- a longer period where I might be terminated after the change in ownership<p>- an additional clause that unvested stock is accelerated should I leave for &quot;good cause&quot;<p>My questions are:<p>- Are these usual clauses to ask for?<p>- What else might I ask for within a double trigger clause",

      "text": "I was wondering, I&#x27;m currently seeing a lot of posts here on HN as well as job offers for senior positions requiring 5+ years of experience.<p>I think that if you have 5 years of professional experience, you can&#x27;t really call yourself a senior developer, unless you&#x27;re at a high growth start-up or a FAANG maybe. But for the &quot;other 99%&quot;, do you feel like title inflation in the industry is a real thing?<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear what you think about this. On one hand, I think it&#x27;s bad to leave money on the table, but otoh, I also think these baselines are really messed up these days.... Any thoughts on why?",
