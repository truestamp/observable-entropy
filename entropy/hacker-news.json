      "text": "Hi HN, looking for some advice please.<p>I currently work at a smallish scale-up. The company has ~100 ppl and the tech side of the company is ~40. There are 4 main teams within engineering with different responsibilities e.g. modelling, platforms, infrastructure etc<p>I&#x27;m frustrated that our shared infrastructure is a bit of a wild west. Things like S3 buckets, DB tables, ES indices, Kafka topics often have nonsense names that mean nothing to anyone other than the couple of engineers familiar with them.<p>This makes it really difficult to<p>- clean up deprecated resources<p>- quickly identify what processes are being used by which services<p>- identify who owns the resources<p>I&#x27;m trying to implement a shared methodology across all four teams to make this a bit better, but need advice.<p>My aim is to come up with a structure for resources that solves some of the above issues. My current thinking is to implement a naming template like:<p>&lt;team_name&gt;_&lt;repository&gt;_&lt;branch_name&gt;_&lt;unique_identifier&gt;<p>One of my concerns is that things like &lt;team_name&gt; can be transient, although it&#x27;s unlikely they will change in my org for at least a year.<p>I also want to ensure this methodology isn&#x27;t just a verbal agreement across engineers, and is instead automated as much as possible - e.g. everything other than the `unique_identifier` is created automatically. Should there be a centralised service that processes make requests to to create&#x2F;delete resources? Should this be config driven and handled in `initContainers` in K8 deployments?<p>I&#x27;ve never worked in a bigger engineering department than this so I don&#x27;t know how this problem has been solved elsewhere.<p>Would appreciate some feedback - perhaps my logic is fundamentally flawed.<p>Thanks",
