      "text": "Hello! I have a question about Linux on the Desktop. And I have the feeling the HN crowd might know a thing about it or two!<p>Over the last years I have been using Mint Mate and was happy with it. But it turns out they don&#x27;t care about security at all. They have easy screensaver bypass bugs open for years and don&#x27;t do anything about it.<p>So I will finally switch. Probably by installing some Debian non-free image.<p>Any suggestions which Desktop Environment I should choose? I cannot imagine switching to something that does not have a taskbar. And most of the new desktops seem to have stopped providing one, right?",
