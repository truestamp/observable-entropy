      "text": "Hello, I’m Camilo from Cuba, I&#x27;ve created an Independent P2P Remittance &amp; Donation Tool using Slyk that everyone can use and help Ukraine people. This is something that we use in Cuba because of our broken bank and money system.<p>The idea is to give a tool for families and businesses in Ukraine to process remittances (receive one currency and remit another to recipient) for their families and friends in Ukraine.<p>Anyone can launch such an independent remittance business by cloning this tool (for free) and receiving USD, EUR, or crypto, and delivering local USD, EUR or UAH.<p>Please check the documentation of the project on xfxhub.com, and I would appreciate any feedback. I’m also looking for links to sources for free-market rates for exchange in Ukraine. In Cuba, we have various sites that publish these exchange rates and I imagine they must exist in Ukraine too.<p>Best regards, Camilo.",
