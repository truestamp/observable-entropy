      "text": "I&#x27;ve always been interested in languages and grammar so when I got into programming I was immediatelly interested in programming languages<p>The problem I&#x27;m having is that I see all these terms being thrown around like BNF, Chomsky Hierarchy, context-free, context-sensitive and regular grammars, LL, LR LALR Parsers, Automata etc.<p>Most books assume I don&#x27;t care about the theoretical details and are more focused on implementing programming languages quickly and with only the minimum knowledge required for doing so. But I actually do care about the theoretical details more than implementing a programming language, which is why I come ask you what introductory books on these topics would you recommend",
