      "text": "Let&#x27;s say I wear multiple hats in work. In some hours I have to focus on on-call and support; In some I need to develop new features; And in others I need to manage infra.<p>Each hat contains a separate &quot;workspace&quot; consisting of a set of Chrome tabs _IN TWO SCREENS_ as well as maybe a set of PyCharm&#x2F;Datagrip projects.<p>I&#x27;d like to be able to switch between each workspace without much delay. For now I group different tabs in Chrome and use different windows but it&#x27;s already a chore to find the correct window when there are 4~6. The perfect solution looks like this: I press a pre-set key, and suddenly 2 Chrome windows show up, one in left screen and one if right, also the right projects are opened in PyCharm&#x2F;Datagrip - not only that, but the windows of other &quot;workspaces&quot; immediately hide themselves.<p>I think the minimum solution is for Chrome to display the name of a group instead of the activated tab when I right click the icon. I can live with opening different PyCharm&#x2F;Datagrip projects once in a while.<p>What tools can I achieve this?",
