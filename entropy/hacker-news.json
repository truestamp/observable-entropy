I started using Google Tasks a few years ago and stuck with it for awhile but over time I fell out of the habit and now I&#x27;m ready to declare bankruptcy on the remaining tasks. I&#x27;m especially interested in finding something always-on (or always-on-top) and maybe with an intrusive reminder to make sure it&#x27;s still accurate on some kind of schedule.<p>Thanks!",
