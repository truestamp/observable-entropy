      "text": "I&#x27;ve come to realize that I should be tracking the time I spend on work and non-work activities with the goals of a) being able to analyze how I spend my time and b) drive improvements in my life-management. I&#x27;ve looked around the Internet and there are tons of tools in this space, so I wanted to ask the community here what they&#x27;re using. My list of requirements:<p>- Able to track the time I spend on an activity manually, this includes the date the activity occurred.<p>- Activities need to be categorized (meeting, 1:1, speaking at a webinar), either using tags or some field.<p>- Activities need to have a context (what project or effort is the activity for),<p>- I need to be able to analyze the data by activity type, activity context, time spent. At a minimum a CSV export would work. If it can generate graphs that&#x27;s a bonus.<p>- I own the data. Due to security requirements the app either needs to be stand-alone running on my system (Windows) or something I can self-host.<p>- I&#x27;m not looking for project management software, I already have that supplied at work.",
