      "text": "I stumbled on to Pathrise[1] recently, which is <i>sorta</i> like Triplebyte in that they make sure you&#x27;re what hiring companies are looking for, then have those companies &quot;apply to you&quot;, but there&#x27;s a twist: you sign an income sharing agreement where you pay a portion of your income for some amount of time after getting hired to Pathrise.<p>Now at first glance I thought &quot;whoa what the...!?&quot;, but thinking about it a little more, that certainly provides at least a non-zero incentive toward serving <i>the job seeker</i>. Doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t serve the hiring company more - hence my reasons for asking about experiences here - but at least it&#x27;s not like they have no reason to serve the job seeker either.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve never heard of them before, so I&#x27;m a bit...cautious. Has anyone else here used them, and if so, how&#x27;d it go? I want to hear it all - the good, the bad, the ugly, the weird, the funny - whatever ya got.<p>Thanks!<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pathrise.com&#x2F;",
