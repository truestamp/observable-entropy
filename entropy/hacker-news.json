It didn&#x27;t give me a great feeling when it first appeared and I couldn&#x27;t find any of the weirdo hipster techno I liked on it at the time so I ignored it.<p>But I&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of the anarchist software dev hippies (who I love) that I work with &#x2F; know seem to use it now. Not sure what that means but I thought I&#x27;d ask HN rather than risk offending anyone I respect at work.<p>Thanks in advance!",
