This somehow makes me unable to check out on the sony website.<p>See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;gL0u6JY<p>Of course, the real error is swallowed by their frontend and all I can see is that an error has occurred. I have to dig into the network requests to find out the real reason why they don&#x27;t want to take my money. Who comes up with this? Why is email validation still a problem in 2022?<p>How can a normal internet user figure this out? If I wasn&#x27;t a web developer I would have given up.",
