This is my first software development job.<p>My problem is, I&#x27;m slow to pick the technologies needed to start working on JIRA tickets. I&#x27;m working together with another junior developer (also self-taught, started same day with me) but I&#x27;m just stuck eating his dust. I decided to put egos aside and ask him for help and the only thing I got was generic advice, which I already do (read the docs, understand what you read, try building their tutorials&#x2F;getting started section, read more code, trial and error).<p>Either I&#x27;m inherently slow and it&#x27;s time to accept the natural limits of my brain or there&#x27;s a better method that would work for me and I&#x27;m missing it.",
