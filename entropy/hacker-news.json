      "text": "I&#x27;ve found myself in this weird position in which I&#x27;m spending more than the median US income on just eating and was wondering if there&#x27;s any way out.<p>As far as I can tell it&#x27;s the most economically rational thing for me to do, as my income is well into the six-figures and so as I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy grocery shopping, cooking or cleaning it&#x27;s a better use of my time to work and pay as much as I currently am ($2700 &#x2F;month) to meet my daily nutritional needs. And yet, the situation seems insane to me from a common sense perspective and I&#x27;m trying to figure out if I&#x27;m missing something really obvious or doing something terribly stupid.<p>The market for food delivery, both at the facilitator and provider level, is so fragmented I don&#x27;t really see there being much room for prices to be lower. Restaurants struggle, workers aren&#x27;t paid very well, and the apps don&#x27;t even make money. So maybe it&#x27;s just as simple as that, the cost of living a cooking and cleaning free life in a high cost of living area is more than the median national income. But I have to wonder, as surely I&#x27;m not the only one in this conundrum [1], is there another way?<p>Cafeterias? Partner up with someone that likes cooking? Some sort of community meal thing? I&#x27;m open to any ideas or experiences people have navigating early adult life in this domain.<p>[1] I understand that this isn&#x27;t a <i>real</i> problem, in the sense that many people struggle to cover the basic costs of food and other necessities, and that this could very well come off as elitist and out-of-touch privilege. But I&#x27;d love to live in a world where those that don&#x27;t like to cook and clean dishes don&#x27;t have to be rich, and the only way [2] to make that a reality is to raise people&#x27;s income or make it more affordable—the focus of this question being on the latter.<p>[2] The only capitalistic way. There may be creative solutions involving the reorganization of people outside of the economic system to solve this, but the only one I&#x27;ve heard about that happens at scale is to partner up with someone willing to take on that role.",
