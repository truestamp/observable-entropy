      "text": "I have developed an unusual habit: I like to listen to podcasts when I go to sleep.  Initially, I listened to podcasts after waking up in the middle of the night to fall back asleep, but since then I began also listening when I initially lay down to go to sleep.<p>I am curious if this habit is not so unusual after all.<p>Do you fall to sleep to podcasts?  And if so:<p>1. What podcasts?<p>2. What audio setup do you use?<p>For myself:<p>1. Entertainment&#x2F;light-hearted podcasts work best for me such as Triviality, Flip the Table, Stuff You Should Know.  I like Real Python, but it gets me thinking too much before sleep.<p>2. I use AntennaPod on an old Samsung Galaxy S5 phone with a bluetooth headband headphones.  I tried corded headphones, but destroyed them when turning over at night.",
