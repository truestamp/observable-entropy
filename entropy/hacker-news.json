      "text": "I graduated with CS degree in 2012. Worked as intern doing web dev, then moved to enterprise Java shop at large corp. Then, spent 4 years at consulting firm coding in variety of technologies.<p>I now work at another large enterprise, and find myself being more &quot;architect&quot; than &quot;developer&quot;. I spend time discussing vendors, high-level design, architectural decisions between domains, and just more overall &quot;steering&quot; strategy than coding.<p>Is this normal? And further -- is this &quot;OK&quot;?<p>Some more context:<p>I enjoy my work; I especially enjoy being involved in the higher-level issues and strategy. I enjoy working with other decision makers, and might even enjoy it more than the hands-on coding work I used to do.<p>However, I worry that I&#x27;m losing my edge. If I want to job switch, I&#x27;d be fucked on the LeetCode stuff. I could study it no problem, but I&#x27;m curious how much pure coding skills impact my career trajectory. As it stands, I&#x27;m not entirely sure where I&#x27;d move next but I want to ensure my skills are valuable (e.g. I don&#x27;t want to become stale!)",
