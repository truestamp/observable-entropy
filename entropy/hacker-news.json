      "text": "I&#x27;ve realized that when I have a super productive day the next day or two after that I&#x27;m not as energetic and can&#x27;t do as much. Is this something that other people face? If so is it because you exhaust yourself on your energetic day and need rest? or is it just random and some days you have a great night sleep and are well rested therefore you have a lot of energy?<p>I have nothing against incorporating rest in my schedule to be more productive, but I&#x27;m wondering if going all out and then resting and recharging is better or worse than limiting yourself on your energetic day to not exhaust yourself (kinda amortizing your energy). I&#x27;m also not sure if the amortization strategy has the same effect. Maybe I need to try it and see.",
