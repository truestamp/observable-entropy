      "text": "Azlo[0] was shut down early last year. I was in Germany, they wanted to mail my balance (&gt;$10k) to me. I explicitly asked them not to, but they insisted that was the only option.<p>I wasn&#x27;t sure when the cheque will arrive so I eventually forgot about it.<p>Fast forward to today, over 1 year and I haven&#x27;t received my cheque. I tried to reach them but all their email addresses and phone numbers are closed.<p>Their website now redirects to pnc.com. I have contacted PNC on multiple occasions and their customer service team have no clue what I&#x27;m talking about. They recommend I visit a branch, which is not possible as I don&#x27;t plan on visiting the USA anytime soon.<p>What options do I have? Do you know anyone from Azlo I can reach out to? I will also like to be compensated for what has been a frustrating waste of time.<p>0 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;select&#x2F;banking-options-for-freelancers-small-business-owners&#x2F;",
