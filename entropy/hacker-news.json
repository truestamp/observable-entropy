Obviously Linkedin wins, but based on team Meta could be close as well.<p>My goals are : Get a promotion in 1 year, have TC at 400k, have great WLB, have free time to work on projects, and not hate everyday at work.<p>I am writing a book and I feel background at FB gives more credibility?.. ie. How to pass technical interviews by Facebook Engineer.<p>Also my future goal is to become a CTO or VP of ENG at medium sized startup, where I also assume FB background would be more attractive.<p>But I really love LInkedin culture from what I have seen and heard, so many days off..<p>Ideally I wish I could go to fb, get promoted after a year and come back to linkedin.",
