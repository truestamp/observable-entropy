My revenue lost will be in tens of thousands of dollars... let alone a nightmare to deal with customer support on a few B2B sites I host I will have to carry on once we are back online...<p>They don&#x27;t say anything on their site, whether blog or forum... but you can see people reporting since last night: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;updownradar.com&#x2F;status&#x2F;dynadot.com#why",
