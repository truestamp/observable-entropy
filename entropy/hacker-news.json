      "text": "Until recently, Markit (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.markit.com&#x2F;markit.jsp) had public historical data for their CDX indecies, now that url just redirects to some marketing page (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihsmarkit.com&#x2F;index.html). And i&#x27;ve gotten silence from them after contacting them about what is going on. I was worried when they got acquired by S&amp;P and my fears came trueâ€¦ ha<p>I was wondering if anyone else knows where to get CDX data that&#x27;s public or information on the underlying?<p>Not interested in the option adjusted spread indecies like that from BoFA and made available by stlfed to the public (unless there is an argument to be made why it should be ok to substitute it in).<p>Thanks.",
