I find my ears are very sensitive to this, and I can detect it. Meanwhile, I frequently encounter others who cannot hear it at all - they just hear &quot;loud&quot;, and they like it.  It would be nice to have some kind of tool that can give some kind of reading on this.  It may not be perfect -- based on machine learning, but at least it&#x27;s a repeatable reading for a given segment of digital audio.",
