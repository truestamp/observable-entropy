      "text": "Hi HN. I&#x27;m working on a new project in the realm of data-centric ML. Audio data in machine learning is quite limited, which in turn limits the types of tasks we&#x27;re able to learn to do (speech to text, text to speech, etc). I think that much more is possible, if only we had the right data.<p>I&#x27;d like to start creating more, varied labeled audio data for ML, and I need the community&#x27;s help to figure out what is needed. Please reply in this thread, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts.<p>Thanks!",
