      "text": "Can someone help me understand how&#x2F;why FreeBSD does releases. It almost seem user hostile (unless you&#x27;re just a FreeBSD developer wanting to hack on FreeBSD).<p>What I find odd is:<p>(a) there are 3 simultaneous production releases (13.0, 12.3, 12.2) - which seems confusing and lack of focus<p>(b) the development process to CURRENT &gt; STABLE &gt; BETA* &gt; RC* &gt; RELEASE. But the problem is, all developers just work on CURRENT. So if there is every a problem on RELEASE, you basically won&#x27;t get the fix.<p>(c) it seems logic to only run RELEASE in production, but the problem is - RELEASE is only support for 3 months after the next RELEASE. 3 months! [1]<p>(d) this creates a situation where companies basically have to fork FreeBSD just to use it in their production environment (and merge from CURRENT frequently). Netflix has to do this, but no all companies have the huge resources Netflix does [2]<p>(e) just the simple fact that freebsd.org list 4 releases on their homepage is alone confusing.<p>These problems has been long documented for over a decade (documented well by @rsync [3][4]), I just feel though like I must be missing something obvious as to why FreeBSD does there releases so strangely.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;security&#x2F;#sup<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21867202<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.freebsd.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;freebsd-hackers&#x2F;2014-June&#x2F;045319.html<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.freebsd.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;freebsd-hackers&#x2F;2012-January&#x2F;037294.html",
