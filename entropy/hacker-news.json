And we can do just fine without top talent.&quot;<p>&quot;Top talent will go to your competitors instead.&quot;<p>&quot;Top talent is overrated and will not give our competitors any meaningful edge. A team of ten average engineers can produce as much value as two self-claimed &#x27;top engineers&#x27; for the same price.&quot;<p>&quot;What makes you think that top talent is overrated?&quot;<p>&quot;Some engineers are better than others. We recognize that. But the top 20% of engineers is not that much better than the middle 60%. They do not produce significantly more code, or significantly better quality or scalable code. An average engineer can do almost anything a top engineer can, but for a much lower price. They cost-to-value ratio favors average engineers.&quot;",
