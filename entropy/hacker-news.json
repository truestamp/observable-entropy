      "text": "It&#x27;s my second job and our team work on some HR software.\nMostly I wanted to see microservices in the wild and how several teams cooperate and coordinate themselves (quite poorly).\nAlso the product domain touches on a lot of legal stuff which is good to know anyway, even if I won&#x27;t ever work in this domain anymore.<p>But reality is harsh. Scrum ceremonies eat up more time than I feel like they should, and they don&#x27;t even work well enough IMO.\nOur team unsurprisingly works on one specific service, which is 90% black box to me because nobody has the time to introduce me to the domain. The rest of a system is even more opaque.\nDedicated devops team handles all infra&#x2F;CI&#x2F;CD, and I have no idea how and where the app is deployed, I only know we use k8s and docker for that.<p>It feels like an eternity before my team would consider me knowledgeable enough to discuss anything significant with them, e.g. data modeling, service interaction etc.\nAnd even when that happens, I&#x27;ll find myself in the same position where I left previous job - a big ball of mud you only can throw away and start from scratch.<p>Overall I don&#x27;t care because the pay is way over than a junior dev would normally get.\nI&#x27;m more worried &quot;n years of experience&quot; line on my resume would mean nothing. How do I prevent that?",
