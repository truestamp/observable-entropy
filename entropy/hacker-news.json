      "text": "My great grandfather was an author, and he wrote\nquite a few books.<p>He was never famous or successful, but he made\na living as an author.<p>I have most of his books that have been handed down.\nThey are old and fragile.<p>The books do not exist in any eBook format and\nI would like to create an eBook of each of his \npaper books.<p>These can then be made available free of charge on the net\nand, be given to libraries if they are at all\ninterested (probably not)<p>The process must be nondestructive.<p>Ripping out each page and feeding it through a scanner \nis probably the fastest and perhaps easiest way of\ndoing it but I will not do that.<p>I have a flatbed scanner and a document scanner\nand a cellphone.<p>I have tried to arrange a stand above the book\nto keep it at a fixed distance from a camera.\nI have problems with the pages since they \ndo not lay down flat and a lot depends on \nhow far into the book I go.<p>The first issue then is developing a process to \ncopy&#x2F;scan each page.\nI am stuck here.<p>Then the next would be compiling them, adjusting\nscans correcting flaws, maybe re scan.<p>Then some form of OCR<p>and then actually making en eBook out of it all.<p>I can make a regular PDF file but I have never tried\nto make an epub file, not sure how to do that.<p>I want the books to be in as good a shape as they were when I started\nwhen I am done.<p>Any tips?",
