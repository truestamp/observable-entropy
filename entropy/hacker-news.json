      "text": "I know I&#x27;m late (way late) to the party but I just bought a very cheap Chromebbook and it beats both of my Windows and mac book i7 machines when browsing the web.<p>Both my i7s are fast but when browsing the web there&#x27;s always a period of time when things slow  to a crawl when web browsing or the never ending updates that tie them up at some very inopportune times.<p>I was surprised how smooth and hassle free it is. I use an ad blocker. I will still need my 2 i7s for work but I&#x27;m sold. If I&#x27;m browsing the web to relax I&#x27;m using a Chromebook from now on.<p>I know most people think of them as less than great but both windows and OSX have gotten so blotted that it slows down even the fastest CPU. Google has done a great job at optimizing the code to work well with low end CPUs. Both Apple and Microsoft should learn from it and create a web only OS.",
