      "text": "Amazon is shutting down their Cloud Cam service on December 2, 2022. I have 10 of these devices that I had already been phasing out with a different solution. I was planning on selling my Cloud Cams but now I can&#x27;t do that in good faith, given that they will be useless in less than 6 months.<p>It&#x27;s such a shame though. There must be millions of these perfectly good cameras that will soon become e-waste. Is there anything useful that can be done with them? Is there any hope that somebody might release a hacked firmware some day to make them useful again?",
