      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>Back at it again with another microsite.<p>So here is some back story:<p>I was sitting in my management class in college today and noticed that there are a lot of people out there who want to get into no-code&#x2F;freelance dealing with several hurdles in regards to the software that they should start with.<p>Here is a timeline of today:<p>1:00 PM - Thought of the idea in class and made a table in notes with my initial ideas and software that I use and how I could execute it. Along with some services that helped me along the way or that I look up to for my own business.<p>1:30 PM - Hoped on Webflow and started with CMS and putting the various companies that I thought of before into the system along with some categories that would make it easier to filter through everything.<p>2:15 PM - After dropping everything into CMS and setting it up, I started building. First was a name and I choose ResourceHub. Then, I started building the site and doing some tweaks across various breakpoints to make it look professional along with adding in CMS connections.<p>6:00 PM - Designing done and everything is simple but gives off a minimalistic attitude. Just needed to plug in a google analytics code and it was time to publish.<p>6:05 PM - Noticed an issue with one of the connections and managed to warp it up.<p>6:15 PM - Done and dusted. All through no-code using Webflow&#x27;s CMS.<p>For anyone interested here is the site https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resourcehub.webflow.io&#x2F;",
