      "text": "Hi!<p>One of the creators here. Very proud to finally be able to show you what we&#x27;ve been working on for over a year now. Curious to hear your thoughts!<p>---<p>What?<p>Objectiv is open-source (APLv2) product analytics infrastructure. It&#x27;s built around a generic but strict event taxonomy, open&#x2F;common data- and infra (currently PG, snowplow, working on bigquery with more to come), and the analyses are done using our pandas-like, SQL speaking modeling library called Bach. As a result, we’re moving towards a vision wherein models can be shared openly, independent of product, platform[1] or data platform[2].<p>How?<p>- Fully assist the dev doing the instrumentation using tools for ide support, run-time validation, ci integration. No auto capture, but very low-effort[1] instrumentation.<p>- Scale using proven tech: a single collector writing to PG for small or snowplow to anything[2] for big.<p>- Feed data into your own data warehouse after validation.<p>- No tracking plan, but an open event taxonomy designed for modeling, that fits most user interfaces out of the box or can be extended otherwise.<p>- Take some of our pre-built models off the shelf or use Bach directly to model on the raw data in a notebook.<p>- Bach generates SQL for the target platform: productionize without lock-in, feed to a BI system, dbt, etc.<p>Where?<p>Github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;objectiv&#x2F;objectiv-analytics<p>Docker demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;objectiv.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;home&#x2F;quickstart-guide&#x2F;<p>Website&#x2F;docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;objectiv.io&#x2F;<p>Let me know what you think and what platform&#x2F;SQL backend you’d like to see supported first.<p>[1] Currently on plain js, react, angular, react native. Future: vue, native android&#x2F;ios.\n[2] Once we’re done building Bach support for all SQL platforms. Now: PG, bigquery in development. Future: redshift, clickhouse, athena, etc.",
