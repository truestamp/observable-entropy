However almost all of friends &#x2F; ex-colleagues have already moved to states and are pursing their education.<p>My strategy right now is become a much better engineer, be employed by a FAANG (currently interviewing) &amp; then directly apply to States&#x2F;UK&#x2F;Canada. Is this flawed?<p>If this doesn&#x27;t work out, I will be 27&#x2F;28 already and would it be too late for MS? I&#x27;ve been worrying a little too much on it, especially since I feel like I am stuck in a limbo while everyone else is already living a much better and happier life.",
