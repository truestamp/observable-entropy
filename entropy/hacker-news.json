      "text": "I have been using handlebars for years now for small production projects. For example a single page of digital signage displaying the output of a JSON endpoint. It&#x27;s been great for that but I feel like I may want to experiment with something new that can optimize my images at build time, gzip etc... What else out there these days can be used for this purpose? React&#x2F;Next is overkill and to be frank not my skillset.",

      "text": "It might come down to taste, but I feel like a lot of the &quot;features&quot; Twitch has been adding have cluttered the interface while offering little of value for someone like me who just watches streams occasionally and isn&#x27;t closely involved in community events.<p>But most importantly, I&#x27;m bothered by the non-dismissable popups that now appear over the video feed. They seem to be for extensions, but what features they provide evades me.<p>These two uBlock Origin rules (which you can add in the My Filters tab) will remove the main two modals that can pop up over the video:<p><pre><code>  www.twitch.tv##.extensions-dock-card\n  ext-twitch.tv##.prime-extension-root\n</code></pre>\nAdditionally, you may want to get back a chat frame without a leaderboard header:<p><pre><code>  www.twitch.tv##.channel-leaderboard\n</code></pre>\nTwitch generates random class names, possibly to prevent your blocking some elements, so I tried to find the topmost classes. I hope that&#x27;s useful to some.",
