      "text": "I started browsing HN in 2018 but only recently found out about BrandonM[0]. I&#x27;m curious to see if anyone had a BrandonM moment in their life.<p>For example, maybe you were choosing between working at two startups and made the &quot;wrong&quot; choice. Maybe you had the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin early but didn&#x27;t take the chance. Maybe you had the opportunity to decide which tech stack to use at a company and made the suboptimal call.<p>Have you ever held a strong opinion which turned out to be completely wrong. What did you do? Does it haunt you to this day or have you come to terms with it?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9224",
