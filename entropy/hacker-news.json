      "text": "Hey all,<p>Quick question on equity split for a technical co-founder. I was approached by an ex-coworker whom I had great rapport with for joining his startup.<p>They currently have:<p><pre><code>    - An idea\n\n    - No revenue\n\n    - No outside funding (I believe some things have been self-funded in the amount of maybe a few thousand dollars)\n\n    - No MVP\n</code></pre>\nThe founder is focused on the business&#x2F;product&#x2F;marketing side and his current co-founder (brother) is perhaps a mid level backend engineer.<p>I am a sr. mobile engineer with full-stack capabilities and I have full confidence I could realize their MVP. I&#x27;d be coming on to the team with the most technical experience and perhaps the most important skillset for implementing the MVP.<p>Their first offer was 5%-10% equity without the title of a co-founder. After expressing my hesitancy toward that they have moved to 15% equity and co-founder title. I mentioned that I would be most comfortable with a split closer to equal, but I would pull the trigger on 25%. I would not be taking a paycheck.<p>Is this strange? They mentioned that their council told them that &quot;cash is king&quot; - in which the founder&#x27;s existing and planned financial contributions outweigh my equity grant. Though I mentioned that I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to helping with financial contributions early on as well.<p>These seem like red-flags, but I honestly don&#x27;t know. A big draw for me towards joining is just having some fun and getting the experience, but I want to look out for myself in the non-zero chance that the company becomes a financial success.",
