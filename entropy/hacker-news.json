There is no central server. It&#x27;s been around for a few years, and has a somewhat quiet web presence. I&#x27;m curious about it, am looking into playing around, and always like to check in with the HN community first, since you all collectively have a ton more experience than I do. Just curious about your thoughts on it (or anything else like it). For reference --&gt; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scuttlebutt.nz&#x2F;<p>Edit: clarification",
