      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and have been loving learning about the crypto&#x2F;blockchain&#x2F;web3 space. However, I&#x27;ve been lost in terms of what sort of value I can actually get out of using a decentralized application. A lot of applications I have seen are centered around Art Marketplaces (NFT), gaming, gambling, DeFi (lending&#x2F;borrowing), token exchanges, and DAOs. As a young person with not a lot of capital on hand, I would love to start using decentralized applications to scout them out and start understanding their use cases&#x2F;what all the hype is about. Can someone shed some light on places I should look? What am I missing? The goal here isn&#x27;t to make money via some scheme to buy digital assets and resell them, but to use a product that adds to my daily life&#x2F;workflow.",
