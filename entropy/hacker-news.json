      "text": "I love to write long, in depth interactive articles on highly technical topics, and spend many hours on research. I&#x27;m aiming for articles that are more interesting and fun than immediately applicable, a kind of intellectual entertainment and learning.<p>This is something I&#x27;d like to monetize somehow. Nobody likes ads so that&#x27;s not an option, and I think most people are fed up with subscriptions. Assuming that my articles are actually good and that the reader, someone who have been programming for many years, is interested in the topic(s) described, would it make sense to sell on a pay per article model?<p>A concrete example: Say there&#x27;s an article that teaches you how to build a custom embedded Linux, cross compile software to it, c internals, serial debugging in qemu with gdb&#x2F;gdbserver, how to write a streaming parser in Haskell for Linux kernel calls, how to run Linux in the browser and use it from JavaScript etc. (all in the same article, with a common goal for all tasks). The article would come with a video walkthrough as well. Would articles like that be worth anything, and if yes, what&#x27;s a fair price?",
