Today I stumbled upon information about supposed marks for the airstrikes on Google Maps.<p>I tried cheking information myself and found it very believable. Replicate as follows:<p>1. Search for Dnipro on Google Maps<p>2. Enter фермерське господарство (means farm) in search<p>3. Do not press enter and look for auto-complete: Those are supposed targets.<p>Those  marks are unusual: you can’t even report them. I never seen anything like this.<p>Video demonstration here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;OHGsFCfuB_k<p>This may save lives, including people I know. That’s why I need your help.",
