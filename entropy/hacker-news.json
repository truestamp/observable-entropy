Example, accidentally searching for Finder on iOS or Files on macOS (spotlight).<p>Would be similar to Dropbox having different names based on device type. Most companies strive to stay on brand. I’m curious of the reasons for keeping them separate?<p>My first thought is possibly legacy, explicit references to Finder (scripting&#x2F;automation&#x2F;3rd party apps).<p>Thoughts? Curious if there is a plan to consolidate naming or keep them separate.",
