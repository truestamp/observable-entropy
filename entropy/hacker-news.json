      "text": " Hey HN Community, saw this exciting announcement from the team at Disco, an all in one platform for live learning experiences, that I thought was relevant to many of you in the group.<p>They just launched a new 4-week accelerator to help an exclusive group of top thought leaders&#x2F;experts&#x2F;creators convert their IP into a premium live learning experience. They&#x27;re teaming up with some incredible instructors including @BillyBroas (who has worked with Tiago Forte + David Perrell) and Suzzanne Howard (IDEO U founder) to help you make it happen!<p>The deadline for applications is September 1st, so definitely recommend applying!  Creators like Adam Davidson (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.disco.co&#x2F;accelerator) are participating.",
