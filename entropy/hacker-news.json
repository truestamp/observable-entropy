      "text": "I am open to different perspectives, but a startup with few months of runway paying 30k to AWS seems like a stupid bet when it could be costing factors less if they had just been using a dedicated server located in middle of USA.<p>Dedicated servers can come with terabytes of data, 60+ GB ram, and 16 cores or more while costing much much less.<p>What AWS&#x2F;Cloud offers is instantaneous scalability and 99.99% reliability. Whereas most consumer&#x2F;saas apps with early adopters DON&#x27;T need 99.99% reliability and aren&#x27;t going viral. And even if they go viral they could always have cloud as back up.<p>It just feels like cult-like behavior to always be on AWS regardless of the circumstances.<p>10M in funding? sure, knock yourself out.<p>200k? you are gonna be broke by next quarter...<p>It&#x27;s like paying for 5 bed room apartment when you are single dude and don&#x27;t even have a pet... why?",
