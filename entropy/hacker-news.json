      "text": "Some of the discussion on a recent post about genetically modified mosquitos got me thinking about this again, so was curious on what HN thinks will end the world.<p>I honestly think eventually advancements in genetic engineering and biology will lead to more and more potent bioweapons until someone manages to make one that ends it all.<p>I&#x27;ve always had this thought in my mind since I was young but now personally seeing COVID spread across the globe in a matter of weeks&#x2F;months has just reaffirmed this belief and I really think it&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone bioengineers a virus to kill everyone on the planet. If something can supposedly spread from a wet market(or lab if that&#x27;s more your speed) in China to the entire world through pure chance (or accident) how hard can it be to do it on purpose once the technology is mature and advanced enough?<p>But I&#x27;d love to hear HN&#x27;s takes on this and your own theories on how we meet our self-inflicted extinction.",
