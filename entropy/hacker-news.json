I&#x27;d been through a rough year and wanted to get out of my hometown,\nand I moved without much of a plan. My line of thinking was this:<p>- It will be difficult to work without a degree, but<p>- There are a ton of developer positions here and as long as I can get my foot\n  in the door, I&#x27;ll be good.<p>I had some money saved up and eventually a small income here. But I had no luck\ngetting any sort of software position. I felt like I was spiraling and applied\nto less places, but I kept my learning up. I&#x27;ve always been developing, and\nlearning new things, so now I&#x27;m confident in my ability to program and learn\nanything I need, but I&#x27;ve screwed up on multiple fronts:<p>- I still have no professional software experience, years later<p>- I started a lot of my own projects instead of contributing to well known, Open\n  Source ones, and<p>- Most of these projects are bespoke, hard-to-explain, and many are unfinished\n  as I lost motivation after I learned what I needed to learn<p>I&#x27;m a bit defensive, but honestly I&#x27;m just ashamed. I now make sure to apply for\njobs frequently, working on my resume, but I&#x27;m not even getting interviews. In\nthe past, when I&#x27;ve had interviews, they&#x27;ve went quite well, but nothing has\ncome of them.",
