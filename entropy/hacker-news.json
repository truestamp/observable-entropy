      "text": "I joined a startup this year, and the CTO only trusts those who joined him during the seed phase. It&#x27;s two years old and he doesn&#x27;t give newcomers a chance. He&#x27;s trying to hire senior engineers, and I&#x27;m one of them, but he doesn&#x27;t give us the freedom to do things our way. For everything, he wants things done the way his pet developer does it, and that&#x27;s usually Django-driven. The HR is powerless, since they report to the CTO as well (CEO manages global operations), so what are my options? I feel like I should leave, but I&#x27;m not the sort to job jump every so often.",
