      "text": "I use Git daily and often but rarely beyond pull, add, commit, and push. Feature branches are squashed when I merge into our main&#x2F;master branch. Meanwhile, whenever I get on zoom calls with colleagues I can&#x27;t help but feel like they run circles around me in the command line with git and I look like an idiot.<p>Don&#x27;t ask me to cherry pick, rebase, or bisect. Merge conflicts I handle in VSCode and oftentimes I&#x27;ll use GitLense or even GitHub Desktop as a last resort. I feel like these tools &quot;work&quot; but that I&#x27;m missing some aspect of being a software engineer by not being a command line git wizard or truly understanding what&#x27;s going on when I do a rebase for example.<p>Are there any books&#x2F;courses&#x2F;videos&#x2F;etc you recommend to level up in Git?",
