If something can supposedly spread from a wet market(or lab if that&#x27;s more your speed) in China to the entire world through pure chance (or accident) how hard can it be to do it on purpose once the technology is mature and advanced enough?<p>But I&#x27;d love to hear HN&#x27;s takes on this and your own theories on how we meet our self-inflicted extinction.",
