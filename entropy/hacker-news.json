      "text": "Hey HN,<p>Our team at Speak Ai is excited to share V1 of our shareable media library with you!<p>As more marketers, researchers and every day people starting using our software we realized they were looking for better ways to collect, analyze and share information-rich language data.<p>They needed to do this quickly and without code or a development team. They also wanted to be able to custom brand their libraries and update data in real-time.<p>That is why we built this. The shareable media library is a culmination of years of work in speech recognition, NLP and media.<p>We are evolving the function to include better insights, more inputs, and simple ways to get answers through natural language queries.<p>If you work in research, marketing or are passionate about exploring personal insights, we would love to get feedback on how we can make this offering even more valuable for you.",
