      "text": "I was looking at an email I received this morning from Oku[0] (A GoodReads SaaS alternative). Like so many others I&#x27;ve gotten from the various apps and services for which I&#x27;ve signed up over the years, the email espoused all the latest updates and changes happening on the platform. I was immediately hit with a sense of excitement and mild despair.<p>While I love the idea of Oku (feel free to replace with any other service), it&#x27;s become so difficult to justify paying yet another monthly fee for yet another service. Oku is even on the lower end at just $6&#x2F;mo! Instapaper and Todoist are others that I can think of on this end at $2.99&#x2F;mo and $4&#x2F;mo respectively, but it seems the majority are $8-12&#x2F;mo. This doesn&#x27;t even consider the expensive subscriptions like Netflix or YouTube Premium that can be upwards of $15-30.<p>I say &#x27;despair&#x27; because I&#x27;m torn between two realities:<p>1. If a service is valuable to me, I should be paying for it. Not only due to “you are the product”, but if a service is not profitable, it will inevitably shut down and thereby remove my access to it; I should not depend on it if I&#x27;m unwilling to pay for it (no free tier usage).<p>2. There are a LOT of services out there (like Oku) that are not necessities, but are useful, beneficial, and deserve to be compensated if used. I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s crazy to think a person could spend $200&#x2F;mo+ on recurring subscriptions.<p>Part of me thinks this could be a “power user” problem, but a large portion of the services I can think of are top downloads on their respective app stores: Music streaming, file sharing, video streaming, task management, delivery services, etc. are all pretty mainstream.<p>All of that to say:<p>How do you “stay afloat” in the subscription economy? Are we slowly drowning in subscriptions? How do YOU prioritize what you pay for? Are subscriptions too expensive? What do you think?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oku.club",
