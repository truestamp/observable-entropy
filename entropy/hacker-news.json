The fact that these tool are even possible shows for me that obsolescence is a feature not a limitation of MacOS.<p>Above aside, how do I actually determine that OCLP is trustworthy and secure? Sure I can look at the code, but without spending days&#x2F;weeks sifting through 10s of thousands of lines of code (not to mention all of the 3rd party modules) how do I go about doing this in practice? What am I looking for? Surely there must be numerous ways in which malicious activity could be concealed from the casual observer.",
