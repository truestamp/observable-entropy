There have been many things I&#x27;ve tried, but there are very few users, and I can&#x27;t figure out how to get them.<p>It is more serious when it comes to the team. I am near my limit of living expenses (rent and food). Both of the other members of the team have fallen into a state of indefinite dormancy, completely demoralized.<p>In this situation, how should I proceed?",
