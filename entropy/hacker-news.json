      "text": "I recently came across an amazing post that really emphasizes the dangers associated with installing npm packages. It seems that every week a new supply chain attack occurs.<p>In my opinion, the existing solutions for this don&#x27;t quite cut it so I decided to create a library which provides runtime protection for Node. It currently protects against:<p>- Unauthorized file system access<p>- Unauthorized network access<p>- Unauthorized command execution - (by way of exec&#x2F;spawn)<p>I just released the first beta version of the library and I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think.<p>Note: Protection is still missing for post&#x2F;pre install scripts, but that&#x27;s up next.",
