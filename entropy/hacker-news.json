I reached out to their support chat and outlined the issue and within minutes they fixed it. Now GetPress is on today&#x27;s popular homepage.<p>However, a great deal of time was wasted due to this issue. Appreciate any support on ProductHunt<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;get-press",
