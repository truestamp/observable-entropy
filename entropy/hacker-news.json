      "text": "Hi everyone! For a long time with friends I&#x27;ve discussed the idea of reading code like literature. It&#x27;s interesting to me that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much culture around this practice even though actually working as a software developer often involves more reading than writing.<p>I just started working at an organization which helps high schoolers run coding clubs around the world and was thinking of ways to help people appreciate the aesthetics of code. I&#x27;m thinking of trying to organize some &quot;code reviews&quot; that work almost like book clubs and am trying to find good material, so I thought I&#x27;d ask you!<p>What&#x27;s the most beautiful code you&#x27;ve read and why? It can be a snippet or a whole repo. I&#x27;d love a little explanation as to what you like about it, or how it changed the way you think. Thanks!",
