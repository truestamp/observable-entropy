As a result I never even finished my bachelors degree, and I&#x27;m now in my early 30s and regretting it a lot.<p>Fortunately I was able to land a job in tech, an industry which cares a little bit less about credentials, and I&#x27;ve now held a number of jobs in software. I&#x27;m paid well and I think I&#x27;m pretty good at what I do. But then I look around and see the cool jobs in 3D graphics, in distributed systems, in machine learning, or other &quot;hard computer science&quot; fields, and it feels like I will never be qualified without a graduate degree.<p>It really bums me out and constantly thinking about it is starting to wear me out mentally. Putting my career on hold for a few years to go back to school has a very high opportunity cost right now, and even if I were to do that I would still feel like a massive screw-up for going back to university in my 30s. At the same time, I feel like I&#x27;m throwing away my potential and my curiosity about deeper technical topics.<p>Has anyone here been in a similar situation? What should I do?",
