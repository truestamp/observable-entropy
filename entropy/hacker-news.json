      "text": "Thanks for checking out my project! I built this for myself to have something to play with for when I felt overwhelmed. It&#x27;s designed to be active enough to be a distraction if you want, but also calming and predictable enough to be relaxing.<p>I built it on p5.js and Tone.js, and all of the settings UI is in Vue. These were technologies I&#x27;ve been wanting to dive into for a while, as someone who codes for a living but does a lot of music for fun. It&#x27;s also designed to be a PWA, so it should work offline if you install it.",
