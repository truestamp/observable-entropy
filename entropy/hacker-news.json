      "text": "Dear fellow hackers, I&#x27;m walking a lot so I decided to give pedometer a shot. But after looking at Play Store I became paralyzed by options that seems shady as usual. So I was wondering if there is any no-BS step counter app for Android. I.e. no cloud, no ads, no personal data collection and sell, preferably opensource, maybe with optional gps-logger+map. I think this disqualifies samsung app, google fit app and a few others as well. No idea which. Also, I have no trust in online review articles since I consider them either payed or not focusing on privacy at all.<p>Thanks a lot in advance!",
