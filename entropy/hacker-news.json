Apparently, verifier apps are fine with it - every one I tried scans green.<p>This is a non-prod demo cert used for illustration of the concept with some funny images inside:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;3JonSRX.png<p>Would there be any interest in me doing a post explaining how it was done?<p>Also, what else should I draw inside?",
