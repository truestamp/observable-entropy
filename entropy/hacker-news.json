This resulted in the loss of loads of family&#x2F;kids pictures, and some understandably very upset people.<p>It’s an iPhone 12 running iOS 15.5<p>If anyone knows of a way to do it, or someone who might be able to help I’d really appreciate a heads up.  Sorry if this is off topic but couldn&#x27;t think of a better forum to ask.",
