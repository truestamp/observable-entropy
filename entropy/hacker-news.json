I believe that we all need to hear the same concept over and over, again and again, and then some more, from different sources, from different voices, before it actually sinks in.<p>Repetition is the not-so-secret secret used by marketers, politicians, and religions the world over.<p>My paradigm:  Fear -&gt; Fail -&gt; Win.<p>Fear: fear is the leading indicator to be used as a compass of where to go. Bear in mind that I am not talking about fear of danger, that is real and useful, and I am not advocating getting ourselves into dangerous situations.  I am talking about fear of the Unknown, my Paradigm uses fear to  go boldly toward the direction of unexplored territory. Fear is Good.<p>Fail: Failing is the next logical step to fear. Failures are necessary steps in the exploration and discovery of what&#x27;s after what comes next. So let&#x27;s embrace, seek, and celebrate failing.<p>A byproduct of failing is that it shows us who are our true friends and supporters. Game Theory at its best!<p>Win: Win is when the summation of Fear and Fail, when hypothesis pans out as intended; Win is both a step in the larger process of Life, and the quality of Life.<p>I believe that we are all born to be creators, to add to the world new things that make the world a better place.  Unfortunately many of us were raised to be fearful, to shun Failing, and to only be Perfect.  And that&#x27;s wrong.  I know that now, a few decades too late.<p>The paradigm Fear-&gt;Fail-&gt;Win is the way to overcome the stats quo. To stop hiding living vicariously through the Lives of others.<p>We need to stop iconizing &quot;successful&quot; people, and we need instead we need to admire them, be inspired by them and then take actions taking the existing work to new levels; jumping off the high ground of the shoulders of giants.<p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.<p>Mic drop.",
