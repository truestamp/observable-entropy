      "text": "Hey all! We’re Rita and Gui, co-founders of Betasort. We&#x27;ve built a simple way to collect user feedback on a feature level.<p>This all started when we were working on another product and were in an urgent need to get into the brains of our users. Which features they like, and which they don’t?  Why do they think something is useful? or not useful? And knowing all that without any extra work was a must.<p>We were surprised to see that there are so many customer feedback tools out there, but none gets the job done quite right. They’re often over-complicated and none offered the minimal UI we wanted.<p>So we’ve built Betasort. We think it’s the simplest way for collecting user feedback on a feature level, and getting all insights extracted automatically.<p>Not quite like getting into your users’ brain, but close enough :)<p>We’ve just published the very first version of the product. It has a limited feature set so far, and we are not charging anything yet. Our goal is to get the very first users really using and getting value from it. Then, with their feedback, we&#x27;ll improve the product and add the next few features.<p>If you find it relevant, I would love it if you tried Betasort for free:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.betasort.com&#x2F;<p>Your feedback would mean the world to us<p>P.s: We’re committed to keeping the product as simple as possible. So if you can’t start collecting valuable feedback in 10 minutes or less, let us know and we’ll buy you a coffee. Or two!",
