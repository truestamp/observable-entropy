      "text": "Hello, everyone. Since the beginning of my school experience I&#x27;ve never truly enjoyed it. I always had a feeling that something is wrong. School seems to be a place where parents send their children, so they can enjoy adult life and most importantly - work. The same duration for complex and easy courses, absence of any choice for exploration, unnecessary stress for children, etc. Some fundamental changes in this system must be inevitable. So, here is my question - What is your opinion on how schools will look like in future? Will it even exist as a fundamental institution?<p>My views are that organized courses must be gone. Libraries, teachers, common study spaces, resources for creativity must stay, because school should inspire.<p>What do you think?",
