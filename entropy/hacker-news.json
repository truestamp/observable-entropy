      "text": "I would love something like a single text file spec&#x2F;yaml file where you specify the knowledge ‘services’ your team uses. Eg:<p>gdrive:\n  folders:\n    - eng\n    - notion-sync \n      - symlink: notion&#x2F;notion-sync<p>notion:\n  workspaces:\n    - notion-sync:\n      permissions: allow-all<p>slack:\n  integrations:\n    - gdrive<p>Something to that effect. Do docker-compose type configs exist to put all these things together? The real value-add would be being able to expose this information in a processible way, eg allowing documents that can retrieve information from within other sources of knowledge (as well as keeping copies of prev state)",
