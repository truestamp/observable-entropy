      "text": "What are some tools or methods (whether real, theoretical, academic, or otherwise) for discovering things on the Internet, as an alternative to using a search engine. I&#x27;m not focusing on practicality here, just looking some interesting and uncommon methods for getting novel results. I suspect there&#x27;s a few specific to certain types of media.<p>The methods I&#x27;m aware of are:<p>- Recommendation engines (e.g. Youtube, most social media feeds)<p>- Organic &#x2F; constructed sequences of data (e.g. a playlist, or sorted lists using some measurement like price)<p>- Non-text search (e.g. search via image, sound, or geolocation)<p>- Stochastic (e.g. guessing a domain name, or entering some random text into a search engine and skipping 100 first suggestions)<p>- Automatic link traversal (e.g. a web crawler algorithm)<p>- Private sharing (e.g. sending a link in an email)<p>- Public sharing (e.g. web portal, or blogroll)<p>- Hybrid (e.g. algorithmic search engine results, news aggregators)<p>But what am I missing?",
