      "text": "We had a catastrophic incident where vultr had a hardware node failure of some sort and we lost some data (we do take offsite backups but lost few hours of data that was not backed up yet and this particular customer has lot of activity).<p>After the whole night on tickets with vultr, their reply is &quot;sorry suck it. we will give you 60 days credit&quot;. We pay them thousands per month for tons of customers. Not trying to bash them but more interested in asking HN if EC2 etc is more reliable ?<p>We do use EC2 for some and DigitalOcean as well to mix it up. I am thinking that we should completely move to EC2  as I have found AWS Support to be the best.<p>Is this just the way it is with VPS companies or is EC2 more reliable ?",
