      "text": "Hi HN community, a friend and I are really interested in ramping on dev for smart contracts. Both have CS&#x2F;EE backgrounds academically and one of us still writes plenty of software. What we haven&#x27;t done is actually take smart contracts head-on and learn-by-doing; so that&#x27;s the plan. We&#x27;ve got an idea and want to code it up.<p>Before just rolling up sleeves, we wanted to pose a question here. For those of doing smart contract dev, do you have any wisdom you can share with us on how to accelerate our ramp up? Short of plugging into the matrix, for those of us builders, what&#x27;s your advice on quickly ramping on solidity?<p>There are courses on coursera we&#x27;ve debated, and between coursera and &quot;just start coding&quot; we&#x27;re debating but would love jump start advice.<p>Thank you for taking a moment to share your feedback &amp; thoughts!",
