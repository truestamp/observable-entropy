      "text": "Until windows XP and Mac OS X mainstream OSs (windows 9x, classic Mac, maybe you can even consider amiga at a stretch) didn’t have memory protection, were insecure, unstable, crashes and freezes happened multiple times per day, multitasking was flaky (I remember playing an mp3 would make my computer stutter in other tasks in win98 even on a then-new Pentium 4).<p>Why did it take so long to get the mass market&#x2F;mainstream systems “modern” when BSD&#x2F;Linux managed to do it in the mid 90s and commercial Unix did it in the 70s? Microsoft did release NT in the 90s but didn’t market it to the consumer market until XP in 2001.",

      "text": "There is an e-commerce website I bought a product from. You basically upload an image, they do a manual processing on it, print it, frame it and ship it to you.<p>I like the product. But I would like to try building a GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate 5-10 images, manually choose one and go with the rest. That would be a good excuse for me to learn about GABs.<p>What are your best resources to learn about it?",

      "text": "I founded a fintech company late last  year and have been focused on developing the MVP and signing up alpha testers, key employees, advisors and potentially an independent board member.  All is progressing, however, I anticipate reaching out for external capital in march&#x2F;april - and I&#x27;m at a loss at how to structure my search for which VCs to approach first.  Or in otherwords, how do other startups develop their target list of VCs to approach first and pitch?<p>I&#x27;ve identified Pitcbhook as a resource for researching VCs and thier portfolio companies, despite what seems to be expensive pricing.   Also the thefunded.com, which appears to be a yelp-like service for entrepreneurs.  Do people use placement agents like PE firms do?  Bankers - i&#x27;m guessing no.  Is it all networking and asking around?<p>Any insight would be much appreciated.",
