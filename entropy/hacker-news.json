      "text": "Hi HN! I&#x27;m Adam Goldstein, co-founder and CEO of Hipmunk (S10). Today we&#x27;re launching Flight Penguin (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fllightpenguin.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fllightpenguin.com</a>) in public beta as a browser extension for Chrome and Chromium browsers.<p>Hipmunk was a travel metasearch site that sorted flights by &quot;agony&quot; and showed them in a Gantt chart view. I&#x27;ve missed using Hipmunk ever since SAP shut it down. So I decided to seed-fund a successor along with my Hipmunk co-founder (and Reddit CEO) Steve Huffman. More recently I brought on Max Morlocke (hn: maxmorlocke) as cofounder.<p>With Flight Penguin, you get a simple, time-based way to search for flights, and it pulls in results from multiple sites. By default Flight Penguin sorts by &quot;pain,&quot; so you see the least painful options before the multiple-layover monstrosities Kayak loves to show first.<p>As some of you know, some airlines are now demanding anti-consumer provisions when they do deals with travel sites, such as insisting that sites hide cheaper flights, hide multi-airline itineraries, and hide certain booking options. We decided not to agree to any of those terms, because we want to make the best experience. Being a browser extension gives us the ability to show the lowest fares without going through airline servers or airline contracts, since we can search and compile all the data from your browser.<p>You can install it now at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flightpenguin.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flightpenguin.com</a>. We&#x27;re also launching a crowdfunding round to keep our incentives aligned with our users: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wefunder.com&#x2F;flightpenguin\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wefunder.com&#x2F;flightpenguin</a>. Happy to answer any questions and would love your thoughts!",
