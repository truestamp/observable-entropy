      "text": "I&#x27;m casually browsing for some engineer manager &#x2F; principal engineering roles. I scheduled an interview with 3 different companies, and in all 3 cases nobody showed up for the interview.<p>In the first 2 cases, I emailed the recruiter about 5~10 minutes after the interview was supposed to start, to check if I had the right meeting link (I know I did, but wanted to frame it politely). After the meeting was supposed to end, I sent another email saying that unfortunately I was not able to reach them, but that I&#x27;m still interested and would like to reschedule. Again... crickets.<p>In the 3rd scenario I confirmed the proposed interview date&#x2F;time, but never received the meeting invite. Only after the interview was supposed to take place, the recruiter proposed a new time.<p>The companies mentioned are Grafana (no reply at all, not even from the head of people who I reached out to after being ignored by the recruiter 3 times), Miro (the recruiter replied several days later with a very vague non-apologetic message, but never reacted to my proposal of rescheduling) and Microsoft.<p>Is this a normal experience or is something weird going on?<p>(and yes, I know shaming companies with their name is not nice, but ghosting candidates also isn&#x27;t nice imho)",
