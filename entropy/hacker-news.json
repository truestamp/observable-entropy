      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of news related to pandemic, climate and other scenarios that compares actual measurements to a &quot;counterfactual&quot; model, where an alternative reality is simulated which &quot;would have happened&quot; if key facts were changed. For example, using a model for how many people would have been hospitalized for covid in a country if the country had been unvaccinated, and comparing that to real hospitalization numbers to make claims about how many lives were saved.<p>I am not skeptical that vaccines save lives, but I am skeptical that these counterfactual models can be used to accurately quanitify specific truths. From my layman&#x27;s perspective, it seems like comparing reality to a fictional scenario and describing the difference. Like saying, &quot;the moon contains 100% less cheese, than if it would have been made out of cheese&quot; or &quot;the average global temperature is 1 degree higher than it would have been if it were 1 degree lower&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the science or math behind counterfactual models, but I&#x27;m sure there are people on HN who do, so my question is, when I see studies about them, do those studies tend to be useful, reliable, trustworthy science, or is it often people using fancy math to manufacture evidence to promote their own opinions?",
