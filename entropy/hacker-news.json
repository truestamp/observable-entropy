      "text": "Many companies, particularly in the tech scene seem to have high expectations of their employees. These expectations go far beyond skills or shared ethics into fuzzier areas such as cultural values. In some cases a companies attempt to architect their own sub-culture and expect staff to follow.<p>There&#x27;s been a few high profile cases of quite senior staff in companies standing down recently after they&#x27;ve expressed an opinion in the public forum that didn&#x27;t align with that of the company (e.g. Google).<p>Diametrically opposed to this, there&#x27;s been situations in which a large number of the staff have collectively challenged the company itself (e.g. the Netflix walkout).<p>I thought it might be interesting to ask, day-to-day, to what extent do you feel free to express yourself where you work, do you perfectly align with the companies chosen culture, and how important is this to you?",
