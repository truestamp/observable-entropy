      "text": "A while back on Youtube, quite a lot of videos popped up[0][1][2] about Skoda sticking their own logo over the Volkswagen logo on their engine covers. Then, this craze suddenly dropped off and I never heard anything about it.<p>Those videos also amassed a peculiar amount of dislikes, suggesting this was either fake or people were very unhappy with Skoda about this.<p>I&#x27;ve always been quite curious about this, and whether or not other manufacturers &#x2F; companies partake in the same (seemingly quite lazy) branding schemes. I suppose what I&#x27;m asking is: is this just standard practice, or frowned upon by the industry, and are these videos fake?<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;q8tur1sUvhc?t=58<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s-7PaqS2gZA<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Etf3yMznKN4",
