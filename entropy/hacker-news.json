      "text": "What are some startup ideas that you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t want to pursue for some reason but honestly think might have legs and&#x2F;or that you would like to see exist in the world? And that anyone who likes them is free to grab and run with?<p>Here are three of mine:<p>* Shamery: a bug hall of shame; anyone can submit bugs they&#x27;ve found in web, mobile, and desktop apps and vote on the worst to publicly shame companies into fixing them. The business model might be that it doubles as a job marketplace that connects high quality QA pros with the companies that need them. But really I think this would just be a funny website that would improve average product quality AND produce fun drama<p>* Router: input a list of job descriptions that interest you and your current experience and qualifications; the output is a custom curriculum for you to pursue, built from a curated collection of high quality resources available online, like MOOCs, blogs, learning projects, book PDFs, online playgrounds, etc. Not just a bunch of resource links but a learning path, with a specific ordering, specific assignments, etc<p>* Rivals - find leaderboard rivals for single player games like Geometry Wars and Slay The Spire. Join up into leagues, run customized competitions, compete across platforms",
