Last week I receveid a mail from IFTTT &quot;Fix it! Instagram is offline, reconnect it&quot;, so I clicked on &quot;Reconnect&quot;  (I thought this was somethings related to the pswd or API) but here the surprise:<p>{&quot;error_type&quot;: &quot;OAuthException&quot;, &quot;code&quot;: 400, &quot;error_message&quot;: &quot;Your account is connected to Facebook account, and your Facebook account&#x27;s future off-Facebook activity is currently turned off.&quot;}<p>So I learned that, since some days&#x2F;weeks, Facebook requires to turn on the &quot;off-Facebook activity&quot; in order to have its services&#x2F;API working also outside Facebook (Instagram is not Facebook) and I suspect also on WhatsApp (but I&#x27;m not using it). Frustrating. Facebook should not do this things, its monopoly is already unbearable, if now it also starts blocking the use of its API on other apps in its uni(meta)verse, it will make itself really hated.",
