      "text": "I&#x27;m already feeling bad for creating yet another docker-related post but I figured f** it, I just don&#x27;t get the hang of it so somebody pls conclusively, once-and-for all, explain the need for and blessing of docker in a simple, fool-proof fashion:<p>What I did understand so far is &quot;Docker is useful if you have multiple applications with different versions of the same dependencies running on the same machine, as well as for deploying onto any machine&quot;.<p>MY QUESTION: (Why) don&#x27;t dynamically linked libraries (.dll) already solve this problem?<p>I come from the .NET world and there I can run any number of applications all with their respective dependencies, e.g. NuGet packages, as .dll files in their own isolated directories - doesn&#x27;t this already solve the problem of isolation and avoid dependency-conflicts?\nThis is also easy to ship to any machine as I just compile the whole thing for the respective architecture and then copy and paste it over, set it up as a service&#x2F;daemon, whatever.<p>To me a standalone application is simply a directory with an executable and all dependency-dlls in the same directory &#x2F; some subdirectory. This is already a software-wise isolated application (obv not on the hardware side but lets leave that out for a second), of which I can run multiple on the same system. Why do I need docker on top of that?<p>I am probably misunderstanding something fundamental here so for the 21375th time, what is an idiot-proof explanation for the need of docker in light of dlls?",
