      "text": "Greetings HN peeps! We are working on a side project, an iOS app called ROFL i.e. &quot;Rolling on Floor Laughing&quot;<p>ROFL is an iOS video app to enjoy standup comedy jokes. It&#x27;s a very rough MVP, feel free to comment away.<p>TestFlight link is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;testflight.apple.com&#x2F;join&#x2F;ZIAuTSVW<p>Why did we build this? \n1. I wanted to work on a side project. \n2. Most digital media has evolved dramatically to how consumers consume content - short clips and shows. Standup comedy has not. Comedians are still producing 30 minute to 1 hour sets and they may lose viewers who aren’t interested in watching the whole thing. \n3. Classic jokes and humor gets lost due to cultural changes, so there’s no single source of truth of where jokes came from. \n4. Places like Comedy Central have devolved their content to become mostly shows, and there&#x27;s not a one-stop shop for just standup. \n5. We think the world needs more humor right now.<p>Would love to hear your feedback.",
