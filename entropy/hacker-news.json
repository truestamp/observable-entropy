I&#x27;ve also seen similar praise for Phoenix as well.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen the same love for micro web frameworks like Flask, Sinatra etc, but always seen the above 3 as bloated but not quite sure.<p>So as the title suggests, are micro web frameworks still a good fit? What are your thoughts on this and how is the ecosystem around this?<p>Bonus if you are using them.",
