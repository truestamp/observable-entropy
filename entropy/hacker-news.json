      "text": "I&#x27;m asking this as it seems like a really common pattern in projects that I worked on.<p>It usually goes like this: system architecture gets complex and elaborate enough that new features&#x2F;modules require developers to manually copy and paste 5-10 files from the similar feature as a starting point. Most of that code is not even related to task you&#x27;re trying to solve, just a general boilerplate to fit into existing architecture.<p>So a custom code generator gets written to ease those efforts.<p>To me it seems like inevitably every bigger project comes to this phase and we end up writing a generator for it. In fact, I&#x27;m working on one right now.<p>Wondering what are the other people&#x27;s experiences with this.",
