      "text": "Dear Hackernews! Currently in the corporate world, haven&#x27;t been a developer for a few years as I&#x27;m currently in a senior business management role and I feel out of touch with the current state of technology. For various reasons I want to start tinker with a product idea on the side, mostly for fun but who knows how it will pan out in the end.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a technology stack that makes this process as simple as possible to get started with on my own but at the same time should be easy to recruit external resources in case I stumble over some funding for this project.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a considerable amount of time over the last couple of weeks deciding the best stack, and even installed a few but I keep getting distracted by all this nonsense (Laravel required an 1.5Gb installation of Docker in the name of &quot;simplicity&quot; and this was just to get started and the whole thing felt ridiculously bloated). It¨s been 10 years since I last touched PHP and I remember the speed to get started quite differently. I don¨t want to go back to a bare bone installation of PHP, I still want all the modern stuff with MVC frameworks, ORM¨s and front-end libraries. I just hoped it would&#x27;ve been, simpler...<p>I&#x27;ve looked at Ruby on Rails, Django, Laravel as well as .NET Core and a few others, I&#x27;ve looked at TIOBE Index, Stack overfloew, various HN threads and other sources for input but the more I read the harder it is because clearly there&#x27;s no silver bullet framework out there and all I want to do is get started with the hacking and feel a bit lost to be honest.<p>So please HN, help me out here, what tech stack would you recommend to get going? I just want something clutter free to build a web application with a cloud back-end. I&#x27;m not worried at all about picking up the programming language as long as it works on a MacBook.<p>Thanks!",
