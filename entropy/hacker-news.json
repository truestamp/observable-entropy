      "text": "Greetings!<p>I&#x27;ve created a GitHub action that works that allows GitHub Actions to exchange a GitHub token for AWS Access Credentials.<p>I&#x27;ve cultivated a few examples of it in action:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;saml-to&#x2F;aws-assume-role-action-examples\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;saml-to&#x2F;aws-assume-role-action-examples</a><p>I&#x27;ve always found management of AWS Credentials has been a pain. So this setting up this Action works like this:<p>1) A SAML Identity Provider is created in AWS<p>2) A Role in AWS is set up to trust that Identity Provider<p>3) A config file is added to the repository indicating which role can be assumed<p>4) The GitHub Action exchanges the Repo Secret for AWS Credentials using the SAML.to backend for the exchange<p>Let me know what you think! I&#x27;m Happy to take questions and comments here or on Gitter:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;saml-to&#x2F;assume-aws-role-action\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitter.im&#x2F;saml-to&#x2F;assume-aws-role-action</a>",
