      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using gmail since the early beta days. One of the killer features was gmail&#x27;s anti-spam capabilities.<p>In the last couple of months, I&#x27;ve noticed that phishing scams around renewing a Norton subscription keep getting routed to my inbox rather than spam folder. I&#x27;ve reported each of these as spam. I finally got around to just creating a &quot;Norton&quot; -&gt; Spam filter. But I can&#x27;t understand how gmail hasn&#x27;t learned this after literally dozens of signals from me that all are extremely obvious as phishing mails from a human.<p>Is there something interesting going on in these mails that makes them so hard for gmail to get them right?",
