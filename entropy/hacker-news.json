Professors told me that it is useful to the career, suits my interest, and it is better done earlier than later.<p>I&#x27;m interested in theories and I often read books and articles about them. However, I&#x27;m not sure if I am capable of producing quality research as I have no experience doing that. Also, from others comment on HN, it seems that research today is publish a lot -&gt; optimize for H index -&gt; get tenure and write grant proposals, which may not be something I would enjoy&#x2F;capable of doing... I consider doing a grad study purely for the pursuit of knowledge, so I wonder if it would be better to just get a developer job instead of doing a grad study...",
