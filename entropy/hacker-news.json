      "text": "Hi HN! We built Employees.fyi to make it easy to compare U.S. workforce demographic data across companies and against industry reference data.<p>In the U.S., the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires the collection and submission of demographic workforce data. We collected and organized the publicly available federal data from the EEOC as well as publicly available EEO-1 submissions from individual companies. By doing so, we hope to make it easy to compare U.S. workforce demographic data across companies and against industry reference data.<p>The URL contains your current selection. Just copy the URL and share it!<p>Some examples:<p>* A comparison of 2018 data for the &quot;Professionals&quot; job category across the Information industry, Facebook, and Netflix: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;employees.fyi&#x2F;?year=2018&amp;job=PROFESSIONALS&amp;reference=51&amp;company1=Facebook&amp;company2=Netflix\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;employees.fyi&#x2F;?year=2018&amp;job=PROFESSIONALS&amp;reference...</a><p>* A comparison of 2018 data for all job categories across the Finance and Insurance industry, BlackRock, and PayPal: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;employees.fyi&#x2F;?year=2018&amp;job=ALL&amp;reference=52&amp;company1=BlackRock&amp;company2=PayPal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;employees.fyi&#x2F;?year=2018&amp;job=ALL&amp;reference=52&amp;compan...</a><p>* A comparison of 2018 data for the &quot;Exec&#x2F;Sr Officials &amp; Managers&quot; category across the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services industry, Accenture, and Nvidia: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;employees.fyi&#x2F;?year=2018&amp;job=SRMANAGERS&amp;reference=54&amp;company1=Accenture&amp;company2=Nvidia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;employees.fyi&#x2F;?year=2018&amp;job=SRMANAGERS&amp;reference=54...</a><p>If there&#x27;s a company with EEO-1 data that you would like to see, consider submitting a URL via this form: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;8cVfXpg69fiiemzc8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;8cVfXpg69fiiemzc8</a><p>Let us know what feedback you have for us!

      "text": "I want to start by saying this is anecdotal, and I feel paranoid for even thinking it. But often my internet will feel very slow, so I&#x27;ll open speedtest to check if something&#x27;s wrong. When I do, all of my stalled tabs suddenly spring into action and finish loading.<p>The tinfoil hat wearer inside of me speculates that my internet provider is overloaded and throttling my bandwidth, but immediately prioritizes me when it senses that I&#x27;m trying to check if I&#x27;m getting what I pay for.<p>Has anyone else noticed this pattern? Is there a way I can test this more scientifically?",
