I&#x27;m pretty sure I had found it on hacker news.<p>What I remember is that it made the example of a village as a system, and the max population the village could reach by foraging in a certain area. It was very long and there were lots of images illustrating the concepts. Searching systems thinking&#x2F;theory on algolia didn&#x27;t help. If you help me finding it back I would be very grateful.",
