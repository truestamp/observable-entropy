      "text": "Hello! I am the organizer of Offbeat Computation Club. Visit https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbeat.cc&#x2F; for more details about our club.<p>We are now gearing up for the second edition of our club meetings. The first series of meetings was about analytic number theory. After 120 meetings across 7 months, it was finally concluded in the beginning of this month. You can read more about the meetings at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbeat.cc&#x2F;blog&#x2F;our-100th-meeting.html where I wrote about our experience running this book club on the occasion of its 100th meeting.<p>The next series of meetings is going to be about solving the CSES Problem Set. The book club meetings will focus on going through a few pages of the CSES handbook together in each meeting as well as on discussing techniques to solve each problem in the problem set. This topic was chosen by popular demand from the current members of the club. Most existing members of this club come from ##math and #algorithms channel of Libera IRC. Some members are also from Hacker News!<p>We are going to spend roughly 20% time reading the book and 80% time on discussing concepts and techniques for solving problems. A lot of emphasis will be laid on seeing the same problem from different perspectives in order to gain a deeper appreciation of the underlying patterns that lead to interesting mathematical properties related to each problem.<p>The schedule and notes for this activity is getting ready now. Our first reading session is going to be on Tue, 19 Oct 2021 at 17:00 UTC. If solving programming puzzles sounds like fun to you, visit https:&#x2F;&#x2F;offbeat.cc&#x2F;cses&#x2F; for more details and join us!<p>You can also join our chat channel via https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.libera.chat&#x2F;#offbeat or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.element.io&#x2F;#&#x2F;room&#x2F;#offbeat:libera.chat (prefer the latter link if you are not used to IRC).",
