      "text": "I&#x27;m a 20-year-old Singaporean who got rejected by the local university as my high school grades were terrible. However, I have self-studied a good amount of math in my free time, including the standard undergraduate fare and some graduate-level topics (e.g., measure theory and graduate real analysis from Tao, computational complexity from Arora–Barak, etc. — as evidence, I have written detailed solutions on my website [0]). As additional proof of my geekiness, I also have 0x$5d.60 in Don Knuth&#x27;s Bank of San Serriffe [1] for finding bugs in his books, making me the 14th richest person there.<p>But I have little to show for all of this — no fancy grades or awards, and no publications either. I&#x27;m not sure what to do at this point, since it&#x27;ll be another year before I can apply to any universities.<p>I&#x27;m quite lost. Should I just find a job? Should I push myself towards publishing something? Should I sharpen my programming skills and try to get hired? I&#x27;d love to just be alone and study my own math, but it seems that it is finally time for me to face the real world.<p>What should I do? Thank you.\n(I will do my best to answer any questions you may have!)<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boonsuan.github.io&#x2F;misc&#x2F;\n[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu&#x2F;~knuth&#x2F;boss.html",
