      "text": "Each month there’s a who’s hiring and a who wants to be hired thread.  And YC companies can also advertise on HN with special posts.<p>Personally, I was recently job hunting and I used a combination of HN and LinkedIn, often getting straight through to execs.  It all seems so different from mass mailing CVs in the nineties.<p>So I’m curious who has good and bad stories to share about how good or bad HN are for actually finding a job?  And any tips and alternatives for hirers and seekers?",
