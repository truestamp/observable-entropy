Almost every morning I go to unplug my charger cable and it either fell out during the night or is so low that it falls it when I pick up the phone. There is no debris in the port. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any older USB port (although I have had to clear debris once or twice).<p>It really sucks that this phone is perfect apart from the charger port",
