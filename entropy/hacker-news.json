      "text": "Hello I am a passionate developer.<p>I work in an interface area between designers and developers. Recently I have been working on a web app (including API) that can generate dynamic images in real time using figma files.\nThese can then be used on websites, in emails, on social media channels or any other scenario you can think of.\nBut before I go live with this application, I would like to test this app. If you are interested in such a service, feel free to check out this page and register. Of course, the service is completely free at this stage! The only consideration I would really appreciate is constructive feedback<p>The link to the web app: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media-mesh.io<p>I would already like to thank everyone who helps me!  \nAlso, if you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them in this thread.",
