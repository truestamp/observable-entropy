      "text": "I&#x27;m learning Python3 on a very expensive platform, I used to save the solution of the Notebooks every week as PDF. I merged them and used them as a &#x27;dictionary&#x27; to solve the following notebooks. Suddenly they blocked it. When I press &#x27;print&#x27; nothing happens, I tried a variation of extension already from the  web store. Still no reaction. I know that I could copy and paste the side, it&#x27;s only, I don&#x27;t want to miss the pretty illustrations. Has anyone a good idea? Does anyone have knowledge of an extension which does, for example, screenshot from the top to the end of the side? Or even better, a method to save the page as PDF without sending requests to their server. Please help. \nThank you so much.",
