I am leaning toward the idealism side of things and as many people here would love to help a bit if possible to advance technology and innovation.<p>I would like to build a Data As A Service company that, in a nutshell, would crawl the internet and stream the data at almost real time. Think of it as Twitter&#x27;s Firehose but for the whole Internet.<p>In my previous attempts, with ideas I had, I would usually spend a few months working on a functional prototype, and pray it would take off.<p>This time I thought I&#x27;d reach out for the wisdom of HN crowd. Where&#x2F;how did you start your company? How far in investigating the idea and&#x2F;or building a prototype were you before you reached out for a business co-founder? Where&#x2F;how did you find them? Did you go through an incubator? Are there any rough guidelines on how to one should proceed from square one?<p>Thanks!",
