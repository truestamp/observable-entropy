      "text": "Appreciate any feedback from fellow HN folks.<p>Have been a web developer&#x2F;engineer for 10-15 years now. Have a great stable job, but not 100% loving the work.<p>Recently switched jobs and increased my pay over 100%, but it’s really not about the money. While it’s amazing that companies are paying this, not sure if this ticket type of work is for me. I would say I’m loyal and prefer working on one solid goal for a company. The current company I work with has me split on a few projects and the context switching is very difficult. I’d ultimately like to move to DevOps, and there seems to be a path towards that, but not anytime soon. Am I impatient?<p>I’ve also been considering completely moving away from tech. I love tech and building things, but the longer I work in development and engineering, the harder it is to keep focus and justify the time vs the compensation for all the time in front of a screen.",
