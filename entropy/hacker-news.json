Here is your licence key&quot;.<p>Now Big Email Provider are marking those emails as spam. Even though<p>- every single email we send is an important email that our users really want to read \n- our email is following all known to us good practices\n- our domain has never been used to send any unsolicited emails ever\n- they are simple plain-text emails without links\n- we usually send not more than 3-5 emails a day to Big Email Provider\n- we ask our customers to mark them as &quot;Not Spam&quot; and they claim they do so.<p>Big email providers refuse to not mark our emails as a spam. &quot;We know it&#x27;s not a spam, but we are still going to mark them as spam to our customers and we won&#x27;t tell you why.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to calculate the exact damages but it does damage our reputation because frequently pepole don&#x27;t check spam and send us angry emails or publicly complain that they haven&#x27;t received an email for a week. (Our replies to these emails aren&#x27;t sent to spam).<p>Is there any precedence where someone has succesfully managed to force Big Email Provider to not mark legit emails as spam or have there been any lawsuits anywhere around this topic?",
