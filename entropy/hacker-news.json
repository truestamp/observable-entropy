Might be despite my STEM degree I&#x27;m not good enough, but the lack of interviews I&#x27;m landing means I&#x27;m being filtered out from the start.<p>The way people make it out to be here, those jobs are handed out.<p>So are companies BSing? HN comments BSing? or who is getting these URM jobs?<p>Does anyone have any advice or willing to provide some mentorship?<p>Thanks, on a throw away because this is embarrassing.",

Despite technical studies dating back as far as 2016 that refute the basis of their claims, DISH has employed paid lobbyists who are attempting to mislead the FCC with faulty analysis in hopes of obscuring the truth.<p>In reality, if DISH gets their way, Starlink customers will experience harmful interference more than 77% of the time and total outage of service 74% of the time, rendering Starlink unusable for most Americans. You can read the details here.<p>The FCC and your members of Congress have the power to stop this effort, but they need to hear from you.",
