      "text": "This is my highly opinionated but closely observed view of the rise and fall of free software.<p>(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish)<p>In 1997 I worked at Worldcom qualifying backbone and data center routers. I wrote a tool to report on and display the health of all of the thousands of computers they could reach. I released it as free software. Eventually it was hosted on Sourceforge.<p>My next big project in 2001 was Axiom, an IBM Research computer algebra product that I rebuilt and released as free software on Savannah, a GNU site. Later versions were released on Sourceforge, Litsoft, and eventually Github.<p>All public work I&#x27;ve done is intended as &quot;free software&quot;.<p>The first real attack using &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot; on free software was &quot;open source&quot;, aimed at a more corporate-friendly version of free software. This is the beginning of the &quot;Embrace&quot; step. There have been many steps in between I&#x27;ll skip.<p>The Extend step is now in motion. Extend takes an idea and &quot;makes it better&quot; (witness J++).<p>For example, I&#x27;m doing work on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) on Altera, which was later bought by Intel. The &quot;best&quot; Intel CPUs with integrated FPGAs are only available on &quot;data center scale machines&quot;. AMD bought Xilinx, the largest FPGA maker. So now most of the FPGA market is &quot;Embraced and Extended&quot;, available on corporate CPUs.<p>I&#x27;ve done work on linux (Fedora, Redhat) as a truly minor attempt at contributing. The corporate &quot;Embrace and Extend&quot; of linux now exists (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linuxfoundation.org&#x2F;our-members-are-our-superpower-2&#x2F;). Microsoft&#x27;s version of &quot;Extend&quot; is Windows Subsystem for Linux. IBM bought Redhat.<p>I fully &quot;bought into&quot; git, moved Axiom to git, and even hosted my own git server. My &quot;master site&quot; was hosted at Github almost from the month Github was announced. Microsoft bought Github (&quot;Embrace&quot;). It recently announced that you need a Microsoft account to maintain code, an &quot;Extend&quot; step, effectively locking me out of a 20 year repository.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve been working on RISC-V. Now I see &quot;Intel Opens to RISC-V Like Microsoft Opened to Linux&quot;\n(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;then24.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;08&#x2F;intel-opens-to-risc-v-like-microsoft-opened-to-linux-1-billion-supports-shift-in-focus&#x2F;). This is another &quot;Extend&quot; step.<p>The Department of Defense and Microsoft have begun the &quot;Extinguish&quot; phase (\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2570849&#x2F;defense-department-ok-s-open-source-software.html).\n&quot;Licensing terms are important but sometimes overlooked,&quot; according to Microsoft, which itself has come under fire from users over its licensing restrictions and cost.<p>“Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, ... a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy.”<p>Free software has been pwned.",
