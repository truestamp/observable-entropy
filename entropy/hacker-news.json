A lot have change since then, but I&#x27;m somewhat surprised that - even though we&#x27;ve had a global pandemic that increased the demand - is still sucks(?).<p>There is always somebody that has CPU problems, WiFi problems, internet problems, AirPod noise canceling problems – all which makes the sound experience unbearable (and there is no intuitive feedback from the system that can help people to improve their issues either). Appliances that you add to meeting rooms are mostly crap; costly, poor sound, not reliable, not intuitive to use and integrate with other systems. People end up using one laptop within a group of people, making the remote experience very bad.<p>Anyone have particular experiences with good setups or guiding principles (that actually work) wherever you are?",
