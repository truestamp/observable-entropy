      "text": "I uploaded a new version as beta, and was allowed and published as expected.<p>Then I promoted it as stable version, rollout release at 10%, ok.<p>25%, ok<p>50%, ok<p>100%, ...<p>... Your app is not compliant, it wasn&#x27;t published (but apparently it is??)<p>The version is literally the same, and the app doesn&#x27;t change its behavior depending on time or anything. I have the theory that their automatic review system checks some random issues at any upload, so everything is fine until it randomly fails.<p>Oh,and the non-compliant is because I didn&#x27;t provide login credentials, on an app that doesn&#x27;t have any login at all, just a search-like feature. But don&#x27;t worry, it happened in the past with the donation version (which is the same app with a different color) and just submitting a message with a sample search query triggered the &quot;ok&quot; automatic review system.<p>¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯",
