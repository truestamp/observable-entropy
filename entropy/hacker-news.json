      "text": "I&#x27;m currently building an app and once done I want to start selling it. I want my customers to pay once, and then have access to it from Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android and Linux. The desktop versions are kind of easy to do, you simply put it on a website and add a payment flow, then let the customer download it. But on mobile, both Google and Apple require that any content that users have to pay for must be paid through an in-app purchase.<p>Another option is to go for in-app purchases on the Apple ecosystem which means users of both Mac and iPhone get access to the content they purchased via AppStore only once. But what if you have an iPhone and a Windows desktop?<p>Can anyone help with a few ideas on how to get this right?",
