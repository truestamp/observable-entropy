      "text": "Is there something like a Discourse forum to discuss programming projects that are not yet finished? Any Discord, Matrix, Zulip servers?<p>I tried Discord but the servers I joined had very hard divisions on the topics, &quot;Showcase&quot; channels had very strict rules and &quot;General&quot; channels went way too fast with no order. I didn&#x27;t find any Discourse community for programming discussion that wasn&#x27;t specific to a single project.<p>I recently finished a MVP and realized that the idea&#x27;s execution wasn&#x27;t good. I could&#x27;ve realized way earlier if I had asked for feedback but I don&#x27;t have programmer friends nor I&#x27;m part of online communities.<p>I will start v2 of the same project and I&#x27;d like to discuss it as I&#x27;m developing. I&#x27;d also like to see other&#x27;s people WIP projects.<p>Thanks in advance!",
