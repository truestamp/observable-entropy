      "text": "For context, I&#x27;ve been out of work for over a year at this point, having previously burnt out last year and lost my job (Canada). Since then I&#x27;ve been interviewing, generally looking, and applying for pretty much anything including just manual labour and otherwise, but to no real avail aside from one-off low-paying jobs here and there. I&#x27;m currently in the interview process and attempting to lock in a contract on a freelance basis, but I can&#x27;t bet on those working out, and certainly not for some time.<p>My main concern at the moment, is paying my accountant for previous years of unpaid corporate taxes due to not having the funds or revenue, paying the government those taxes, keeping a roof over my head, eating, and dental work that&#x27;s going to get tremendously painful in the next few weeks. All of those are getting to the point where I&#x27;m going to have to make some hard decisions on very soon.<p>Are there any ways that I&#x27;m missing in which I can start very quickly bringing in <i>some</i> cash with reasonably solid javascript, people skills, and to a lesser extent python and many others? It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m not willing to work, it just seems like I&#x27;ve been massively unsuccessful in getting into a place where I can do it. With interview processes becoming ever-more length and volatile, things aren&#x27;t really looking up.",
