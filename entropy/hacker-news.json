However, every now and then the path of taking a job pops up in my head.<p>I have never taken a job offer from a company before. I&#x27;ve only ever worked on my own projects. One of them got funded and went on to becoming a business but the subsequent projects only ever reached pre product market fit. Still, I have experience designing, building and distributing products. I have conducted hundreds of user interviews over the years and do think that I have a lot to offer.<p>How challenging will it be for me to gain credibility without a reputable organization or logo backing me?",
