      "text": "Dear HN: An angel investor who came through an inbound intro signed a YC-standard template SAFE on favorable valuation with us where the expectation was the funds would be wired quickly. But after that the investor is stalling&#x2F;deferring the wire by a couple of weeks, even as we go to raise at higher valuation from others.<p>What are our options as a startup at this point if we don&#x27;t want to work with this investor ? The investor has a fully signed SAFE (after doing due diligence), but just hasn&#x27;t sent the funds.<p>We have revoked that investor&#x27;s access to even see our wire details at this point because we don&#x27;t want to work with this investor if it can be avoided. So if this &#x27;investor&#x27; is never able to actually send the funds in a far out future, what happens to that signed SAFE ? How does it get revoked or expire in the absence of funds being transferred ?",
