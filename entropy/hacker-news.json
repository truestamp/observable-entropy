      "text": "Hello,<p>This is&#x2F;was me: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29690759<p>I am now looking at Interview Kickstart and Outco to help me prepare for dev interviews. IK seems cheaper overall, but aside from that, I am not sure which one is best for me. I have heard that Outco is more geared towards early career devs or people with very little experience at all, whereas IK is more about experienced devs who want to break into bigtech. I am not even sure whether I count as &quot;experienced&quot; given the small nature of the startups I used to work at as well as how much I now realize I have forgotten due to my law school hiatus.<p>Anyone have any experience with either? Even if not, what do people think I should be looking for? Across which attributes should I be comparing and scrutinizing their respective offerings?<p>Thanks",
