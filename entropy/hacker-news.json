      "text": "Ask HN: Anyone here have good material for learning how to sketch from scratch?<p>Related to this previous post:\n&quot;Apologies if this is off-topic but the learning French thread got me wondering if anyone here is an artist in the downtime and has recommendations for learning materials when it comes to learning how to draw? I&#x27;ve tried Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain and it doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I&#x27;ve tried nma.art and that&#x27;s like the closest I&#x27;ve come to what I&#x27;m after but currently suffer from paralysis analysis with too many or too few courses to choose from. Any suggestions? I&#x27;m hoping to be able to eventually draw people and landscapes, willing to pay hundreds of dollars potentially for the right course or instruction per month not really looking for like a udemy type thing.&quot;<p>What about approaches to teaching children initially?  Most of what passes for art instruction in elementary schools seems to come from the school of thought of &quot;just give them some paper and pens and glue and glitter and they&#x27;ll come up with something&quot;.  Or, worse, there is no art instruction whatsoever in school.  Curious if anyone has any thoughts on any programs or approaches that actually provide young kids with high quality foundational art instruction before their brains are fully formed into &quot;I can&#x27;t draw (&#x2F;paint&#x2F;model&#x2F;sculpt&#x2F;etc.)&quot;",
