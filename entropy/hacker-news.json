      "text": "Hey Guys, Neeraj here - founder of Snackwyze (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snackwyze.com), the easiest, fastest and the most affordable way to create, share and track clickthrough demos for your software.<p>Personally, I have been in Sales and marketing for over 10 years and worked at various companies &#x2F;various sizes including Cisco. And in those many years, I never found an easy way to create clickthrough demos for sales and marketing use cases. So I decided to build a platform for the same. My buddy and I built a chrome extension that records your screen and converts every single click into a step-by-step clickhthrough demo that you can easily share, embed, download and then track from the Snackwyze platform.<p>I&#x27;d love for you guys to try it out and let me know if you find it useful. If you are looking to create product tours&#x2F;deos for your website then I&#x27;d be delighted to help you build as well.<p>Thank you! Cheers",
