      "text": "I&#x27;m using Cloudflare to handle DNS for my portfolio website (just a few static pages generated with Gatsby). I rarely advertise my website, and unless I&#x27;m job searching, I don&#x27;t even share the link anywhere. I expect to get about 10-20 visitors a month when I&#x27;m job searching and otherwise only the occasional visit. I don&#x27;t have Google Analytics or any other kind of tracking script installed because I have no reason to track my visitors. But today I was poking around in the Cloudflare dashboard and noticed that the analytics say that my domain has had 19k requests in the last month, a significant percentage of which come from Russia, the UK and Singapore, where I do not do any business or even have any connections.<p>So what&#x27;s going on? Are the Cloudflare analytics completely made up? Am I being targeted by some kind of bots? Are there legitimate requests that I might not be considering? Has anyone else had a similar experience with Cloudflare analytics.",
