      "text": "Hey HN,<p>During the past year, my cousin and I acquired an abandoned side project, monetized it and eventually sold it for ~$20,000.<p>In the end, the project was generating around $700&#x2F;mo and had 3000 registered users.<p>However, we were never able to truly find a scalable user acquisition channel so we ended up selling it recently.<p>Some of the lessons I learned include, not optimizing for AppSumo users, building trust with potential acquirers, and learning the value of building a strong acquisition channel.<p>If you want to hear more about the lessons I&#x27;ve summarized them in this article:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;benjlin.medium.com&#x2F;lessons-learned-from-selling-my-side-project-for-20-000-7b820b9e6422",
