      "text": "Scenario: Let&#x27;s say your either starting a club, company, or just meeting someone new and you want to mutually land on a vision statement or aligned set of principles about whatever the goal of that club might be.<p>One interesting way to go about this would be to maybe have everyone fill out a survey, or write their own little manifesto, and keep the results secret, and then simultaneously reveal everyone&#x27;s results to everyone else at a pre-determined future date.<p>The easiest way I can think of to do this would be to just have everyone write a Word&#x2F;GoogleDoc&#x2F;Text doc of some kind, and have them literally drag it into a Dropbox&#x2F;Drive&#x2F;iCloud folder at the same date and time.<p>However, I&#x27;m wondering if there is a tool out there that would make this more fun, and done in such a way that any individual who just wants to get it done ahead of time can do so, and let the software do the reveal?<p>Is there any kind of cool, &quot;Simuldrop,&quot; tool or method that anyone out there has built or uses? A web-based tool would be cool and have the widest reach, but any suggestions for command-line tools, technical solutions could be interesting as well of course because after all...this is hackernews.",
