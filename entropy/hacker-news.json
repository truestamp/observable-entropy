      "text": "Are there any open-source &quot;general purpose&quot; JIT compiler&#x27;s out there? &quot;General purpose&quot; in the sense that it is not tied to any programming language (unlike v8 and luajit). At a high level, I want to feed in IR and get out a function pointer to call.<p>My use case is I have a DSL with a custom parser and interpreter. The DSL is essentially a programming language and is proving too slow (in terms of latency). The bottlneck is in the interpreter. I want to replace the interpreter with a JIT without having to deal with assembly code generation myself.<p>Preferably in Rust and&#x2F;or Rust bindings. Preferably lightweight (small object code footprint). Preferably cross-arch (x86, arm, arm64).",
