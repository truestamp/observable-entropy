      "text": "I have a startup idea and multiple product ideas and may like to find a cofounder via the Cofounder Match service at the Startup School, but in the Cofounder Match application there is a required field to indicate where do you as a founder currently work. Why should I fill this field if my startup and product ideas for which I search for cofounders are not related to my current job? Moreover, if I hate my current job and all the rather big company I formally work in and wish it would go bankrupt promptly with everyone of their managers, clients, CEOs, accountants and IT admins go hang their useless selves off.<p>The fact that I work somewhere may indicate that I can work in a team and peform tasks assigned to me well enough. But for a team I would be gathering for my projects I would do completely different and comprehensive things. Why is it necessary for a founder in search of cofounders to indicate where do founders formally work?",
