      "text": "I&#x27;m a reatively new manager with a litte over 2 years experience in the role. As I&#x27;m looking to change companies, I&#x27;ve been interviewing strcitly for management positions, never really paying any attention to individual contributor (IC) openings.<p>I just had an old colleague offer up a promising role as an IC in his current company, which has me intrigued but also skeptical. For those who have made the transition back from manager, did you see it as a positive move or a step backwards? Did you eventually go back into management, or find that you should have never made the move to begin with?",
