      "text": "Hi, I have been working at my tech company for last 3 years as Senior engineer (6 years experience in total). Four months back we hired a new tech lead for our team, who happens to be my manager as well. I didn&#x27;t interviewed her.<p>At first things looked normal and she seemed to be a great person&#x2F;engineer. However, last week I was doing a code review of a PR raised by her and noticed a code which looked very familiar, something I have seen in an open source project (that I closely follow). On a deeper look I found that multiple files have been copied from the open source project (with an MIT license) and have been added in our propriety code.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how to handle this situation, it seems illegal (definitely not ethical).",
