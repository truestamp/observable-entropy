I assume this is so because the ancient JPEG is the underlying, embedded image compression format.\n(I believe above some version of PDF, JPEG2000 can be used too - but in my examples I see no evidence of its less blocky compression abilities in use)<p>Hence: Is it possible to use AVIF images inside PDF files, for better picture quality and better bandwidth use?<p>Thanks for your answers!",
