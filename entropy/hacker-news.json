Keeps showing &quot;Our CDN was unable to reach our servers&quot;.<p>However, redditstatus.com shows no incident reports and shows error rate as having reduced.<p>Because it&#x27;s just Reddit, it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>But it would look bad if this was from a commercial SaaS. Comes across as either shoddy or dishonest.<p>Every SaaS today depends on lots of 3rd party infra - CDN, DNS, AWS, payment gateways, search engines, and more.<p>My question: Are there any architectural patterns in monitoring &#x2F; observability to reduce such mismatches between reality and status pages?",
