The ones I seem to end up finding that are rated as the most secure have so many negative reviews.<p>It seems like any VPN people recommend I will find a a myriad of negative comments about on another website.<p>I must admit I was not surprised it would be hard to find concensus but it seems like any service you choose with high security is shady (based on reviews).\nThis could ofcourse be due to shills for other VPNs posting negative reviews to steer users away.<p>My main concern is security, I just want to be sure my private data is not shared with my ISP and the VPN I choose does not sell my data as I work with patents.<p>I know that it is not possible to guard yourself 100% against this as when you connect through a VPN you have to trust to some extent that they do not break their own terms.<p>When I want to stream netflix I will just disable the VPN as that is not a problem in my country.<p>It would be a plus if the VPN allows torrenting but not a requirement as I could just get a secondary VPN for this.<p>Is it really possible to get what I need from a commercial VPN or do I need to have something else for the level of security i require?<p>Thanks in advance for any constructive replies",
