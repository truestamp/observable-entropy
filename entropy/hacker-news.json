      "text": "The US is again warning of potential cybersecurity attacks against the US. Hearing this, I can&#x27;t help but roll my eyes and lament the way we treat those who report cybersecurity vulnerabilities.<p>Recently, the governor of Missouri made it a personal political goal to prosecute a &quot;hacker&quot; who did nothing more than view the source of a government web page. It&#x27;s easy to find other cases where people are harassed, prosecuted, and sometimes jailed, after reporting a vulnerability.<p>I myself once discovered an apparent security vulnerability, but I just closed my browser and walked away. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the potential harassment or worse. I think many are like me.<p>What changes can lawmakers make to improve this situation? How can we protect those who report security vulnerabilities?",
