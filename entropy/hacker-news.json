      "text": "I&#x27;m a 3rd year student majoring in computer science at the University of Texas at Dallas.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking around for Summer 2022 internships and all of them seem to be just general software dev, machine learning, data science, etc., internships. Basically anything except cryptography.<p>I&#x27;ve applied to positions at IBM and a few other places relating to cryptography and even though there&#x27;s a good number of cryptocurrency startups, many don&#x27;t seem to take on interns.<p>It&#x27;s a shame as I&#x27;ve realized I have a passion for cryptography. For example, I&#x27;ve recently taken a midterm for a grad crypto class and it was one of the only times I got full marks on a university exam. I&#x27;ve been going through the Cryptopals Challenges and doing NSA Codebreakers 2021 though I have much to learn.<p>So, how does a student find cryptography-related internships, both academic and industry?",
