It is very crude but does the job.<p>bot: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;gratitude_buddy_bot<p>github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ikraamg&#x2F;gratitude-buddy-bot<p>After failing to get myself to do gratitude journaling through other means, I got the idea of a simple chatbot.\nFor me, the &#x27;killer feature&#x27; that kept me using it was a daily reminder of a past entry that got me to smile on a pleasant memory.<p>I thought it might be helpful to more than my friends, family, and me. Feel free to use the same instance I use, or run it on your server.<p>I know this will not scale, so if many people find it useful, I will rewrite the bot in rails, add a web interface and migrate the data.<p>P.S. I had not dealt with databases at the time I built this, so please forgive the &quot;DB&quot; I used :)",
