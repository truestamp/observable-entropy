      "text": "This may seem like a trivial question (especially on HN!), but there are so many different aspects to programming that it’s valuable to explore them. We are particularly interested in doing this so that educators can develop a broad view of what the purpose of teaching programming is, and deal with a range of views they may encounter as students engage with the subject.<p>The document has been written by a group of Computer Science Education researchers (WG5 at ITiCSE 2022 [0]), and is available, at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;nop-framework, together with a form for collecting your comments in structured way.<p>If you are an educator or a CS expert interested in CS education, we would be grateful to have your feedback about the scientific soundness of the document, and its interest, usefulness, and readability for educators. Please, read the accompanying document first, and then complete the survey. The questions in the survey are organized in two parts: the first aspect concentrates on the &quot;facets of programs&quot;, the second one explores &quot;How programs are created&quot;. The comments collected (anonymously) in the survey will be used to revise and improve the document which will be published as a report by ACM.<p>I&#x27;m one of the member of the working group: I&#x27;m happy to answer to any question you may have.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iticse.acm.org&#x2F;2022&#x2F;working-groups&#x2F;#wg5",
