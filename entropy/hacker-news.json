      "text": "Most of my career has been working with older existing systems. Many have struggled to stay up to date. With desktop applications that&#x27;s not a huge problem, but with web applications they die. I&#x27;ve seen this with a brilliant system that had a Flex (Adobe flash derivative) front end. It got killed.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this with front ends written in ExtJS, it&#x27;s just so old now that maintaining it is a pain. The same thing with old versions of Zend. PHP 5.6 is no longer supported but most operating systems out of the box so we have to find an upgrade path.<p>Has anyone found a stack that lasts? Or a method of avoiding this sort of thing?",
