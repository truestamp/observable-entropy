      "text": "When I was a kid in school, each year there would be a new science textbook and invariably within the first few weeks I’d read the whole thing. What I enjoyed about textbooks at that level was a lot of basic (but scientific) knowledge about a lot of subjects, which I could then explore more deeply if I liked. Encyclopaedias were also nice for this, but the science textbooks really were my favorite.<p>The closest thing I’ve found is YouTube channels, but great ones aren’t necessarily super common, and I don’t know if any with a wide scope. Wikipedia I often find the articles are too complex when you get into specific topics.<p>The purpose is just for fun and intellectual stimulation, so not really looking for educational programs. Does anyone have any recommendations?",

      "text": "I subscribe to a few YouTube channels and noticed one in particular has had a recent explosion of bots in the videos&#x27; comments section.<p>However unlike a traditional spam bot posting links or other advertising (like you would see on HN if you browse with showdead enabled), the purpose here is a bit unclear. The bots all fit a similar profile - they are young attractive females with Hispanic-sounding names that leave generic pleasantries or inoffensive non-sequiturs. Due to the channel&#x27;s niche subject matter, a person fitting that description is probably the least likely person on the planet to be a subscriber so they stick out like a sore thumb.<p>I&#x27;m trying to understand what is going on here, since they simply add noise to the comments section. One theory is this particular creator - who is vocally obsessed with viewers and hit count - has purchased bots to artificially increase the views, and these comments are a method to evade Google&#x27;s anti-abuse software by posing as legitimate viewers leaving innocuous-sounding comments. Does anyone have any other ideas?",
