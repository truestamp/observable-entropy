The code is very specific to my use-case and will continue to evolve as I use it.<p>The bot is here <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AI_IMAGE_BOT\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;AI_IMAGE_BOT</a> It isn&#x27;t fully automated (yet).<p>The bot scrapes the latest trends (and soon news) from twitter, creates images and tweets them out.<p>It all runs locally from my machine for the time being.",
