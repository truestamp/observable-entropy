The role&#x2F;level has its obvious perks (recognition&#x2F;influence&#x2F;very well compensated&#x2F;etc.).<p>However, I feel some fatigue&#x2F;burnout from leadership responsibilities. I have been burnt before and know what an ugly place it is.<p>What are your advice to help bring back some balance?

If so, please enlighten me.",
