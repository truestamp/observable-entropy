Everyday I receive calls from bank customers who think that I&#x27;m a bank employee. The website that Google used to get the contact number is not an official website for the bank but for a Partnership project I worked with the bank for which I was a contact person. The phone number on the the website was changed two months ago and requests to change the number through Google&#x27;s procedures has yielded nothing despite multiple attempts.",
