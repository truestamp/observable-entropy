      "text": "I&#x27;m a PO that&#x27;s developing a fintech product in South Africa. Our banks don&#x27;t play nicely in terms of data extraction and APIs are non-existent. No such thing as open banking here.<p>I am looking to hire a developer that is a specialist in reverse-engineering the API&#x27;s that the bank&#x27;s use to connect their mobile apps to their servers. We would then use the structure of those API&#x27;s to build our own products on top of. We currently have a version of this product that works using scraping, but we&#x27;re exploring a solution that is more sustainable.<p>2 Questions:<p>1. What specific skills should I be looking for in this developer? Native experience? Backend&#x2F;API-specific?\n2. Where best to look for that type of developer, if anyone has any advice?<p>TIA",
