      "text": "Hello, HN pros.<p>I have looked in this area a bit and have realized you need a minimum PhD to work in the tech research. For example, Google Research, MS Research, Quant Research in a Trading Firm, etc.<p>Now, a PhD does take around 5 years of time with no salary as such.<p>I am an Asian who is cs senior undergrad  graduating in 2022. I already have got a offer at 95k usd per year for a software engineer role once i graduate. It&#x27;s huge money for me. I have been funding my undergrad with a 5k usd per year scholarship.<p>Now I am actually interested in doing research rather than being a software engineer. And I know I am good at it. (If its fun then I am good aint i?)<p>Me and my parents have a concern that i might be wasting 95k*5 ~ 0.5 mil usd into a phd and my job would be something like 200k-300k usd per year which i could even get after 5 years of swe exp.\nThey arent wrong I believe.<p>What options do I have now? (Not losing 0.5 million and still being able to do good research)<p>The firm with the 95k offer will never let me get into research. They only want software engineers. They hire only phds for research.<p>I have thought of some scenarios:\n1. I work a few years (3-5) at 95k usd. save money for fam. do phd next 5 yrs. try to get a offer that might ignore the revenue i lose in those 5 years.<p>2. I do partime work senior year ug and then try to get partime work&#x2F; many industry internships during phd so i still be able to make ~60-70k usd per year (Not doable I think)<p>3. I not do phd and stay in a swe role which is interesting but i will always regret not doing research. (noooo)<p>4. I join a firm which identifies my research potential in UG itself. It provides for a transition from say swe-level role to phd level research without a phd in within 5 years of swe-level role. (i guess no one allows someone to do phd-level research without phd).<p>Any ideas? Any comments?",
