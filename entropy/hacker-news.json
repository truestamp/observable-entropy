      "text": "Hi<p>I’m the author of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;antonmedv&#x2F;fx (terminal JSON viewer)<p>Recently I decided to rewrite the entire program to Go. And usually, on second rewrite things end-up better. Main reason for this, I believe, is clear end-result, the target.<p>I think new version of fx is much more superior:) I recommend, to check it out ;) Would like to have some feedback and ideas for improvement.<p>One of new cool features is reducer languages: not only JS, but also now it’s possible to write reducers in Python and Ruby.<p>I’d like to hear some feedback from people with more background in Python and Ruby. For example, should Python reducers come with builtin DotMap or not?<p>Thanks)",
