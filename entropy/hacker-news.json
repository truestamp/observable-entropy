      "text": "I&#x27;m a SRE in Europe with 7+ years of experience and my girlfriend got invited to work on a research project in the USA. So currently I&#x27;m investigating job options to move (probably temporary, but who knows) to the US. I&#x27;ve been to the US multiple times and stayed there a couple of month in my late teens early 20ies since I have some relatives living there, but I never worked in the US.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem finding jobs in my field in Europe, but after writing about 20 applications I didn&#x27;t get a single interview and only got &quot;we don&#x27;t do VISA sponsoring&quot; as a response. I specifically always checked if it said &quot;no visa&quot; in the description. I would be very grateful for any tips to get a visa.",
