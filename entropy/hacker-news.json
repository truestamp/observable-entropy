      "text": "I need to figure this out to optimize UX and journey to conversions on my app.\nIn my case, it&#x27;s about choosing a restaurant. Current apps tend to put first packaging or cuisine type, while food specific taste can be a decisive criteria on the journey to choose a place to eat.<p>There are a couple studies about the importance of packaging on perceived taste, but none seems to look for a ratio of importance between perceived future taste (packaging, reviews, photos) and known taste (ingredient, dish name, referring to taste memory) when the buy decision has to be made.<p>About customer journey : Objective past first or subjective future first?",

The company was a travel tech startup that I joined as an early employee, and it was acquired a few years ago. The app is still active and supported, but it feels time to start exploring what else is out there.<p>In case it matters, my background is largely in various QA and product roles, most recently transitioning from project management to product management.<p>Are the traditional places like Linkedin and Indeed the best places to upload resumes, update skills, etc.? Do I need to fully dive into the job-hunting waters and network with recruiters to get a good idea of where I &quot;stack&quot; so to speak?",
