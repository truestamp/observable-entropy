It seems like the services are still working, but have much more latency compared to other services I&#x27;ve used the last 24 hours.<p>Several times requests have taken 15+ seconds, so it&#x27;s making me suspect they are deprioritizing requests to handle some sort of outage behind the scenes. Alternatively, my account might just be part of tests to see what happens when user requests are slow.",
