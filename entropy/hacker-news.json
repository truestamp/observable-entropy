      "text": "I want to start a hobby project which needs to have as less development time as possible. I would want social media login (sign up via email, fb, google accounts, etc.), user management, connecting to a posgres (or even sqlite) db, deployments (perhaps to a paas like cloudrun, heroku, aws beanstalk etc.), db migrations etc. all already automated. If there is some automation for the API body and parameter validation from a openapi spec that would be even better.<p>I just want to write the core business logic for the API handlers and leave everything else to the framework. I do not mind (and actually would prefer) if the framework is opinionated and works well for its intended goals.<p>I prefer Typescript&#x2F;JS, Golang, Kotlin in that order. If no other option, then python3 would be an acceptable choice.<p>Any recommendations ?<p>tldr: I want a batteries-included API framework with users management, session management, db management, openapi integration. Help ?",
