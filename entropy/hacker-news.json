I also have a dedicated staff member who, though not an experienced marketer&#x2F;growth hacker, can accomplish much when given clear direction.<p>I would like to launch the product to the general public and then (say three months after) to my list of warm leads.  Can anyone recommend a very detailed step by step book or guide (ideally one they have personally used) to marketing and launching a product that could be outsourced to an intelligent non-marketer?<p>I realize that what I am describing is not an ideal way to market a product, but the assets I have are what I have, and the perfect is ever the enemy of the good.<p>Thanks Everyone!",
