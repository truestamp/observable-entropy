      "text": "I&#x27;ve been spending the last days (while having the flu) on a new development board around the Raspberry RP2040 microcontroller and ESP32 with some interesting features and decided to open source it. Hope anyone might find this interesting.<p>What makes it special?\nThe RP2040 are interconnected via an UART with an additional pin which can be used as a handshake or interrupt pin. The RPC protocol between both microcontrollers is serialising the data using Google ProtoBuf.<p>The Display Option is connected to the ESP32, which can then offload the UI&#x2F;WiFi&#x2F;BLE component.<p>Features:\n- RP2040 Dual Core Cortex-M0+ Microcontroller with PIO (Programmable IO)\n- ESP32-WROVER Dual Core Microcontroller\n- 4x DIN MIDI Input\n- 4x DIN MIDI Output\n- 2 Rotary Encoders\n- 4 User Buttons + 1 Shift “Alt Function” Button\n- RP2040 PIO &quot;coprocessor&quot; utilised to scan Buttons and Encoders (Shift Register + PIO)\n- ILI9341 TFT 2.4&#x2F;2.8” Display Option (not included)\n- Separate 1A LDO for ESP32 Power Supply, because WiFi can be quite power hungry\n- High-Speed Serial Bus for RPC with Handshake between RP2040 and ESP32 (using Protobuf RPC) (Work in progress)\n- PMOD-ish Connector interfaced with RP2040 for expansions (universal, PIO can be used).\n- Heartbeat LED on ESP32\n- 4 Addressable RGB LEDs loaded at 4 User Buttons\n- Firmware Update via WiFi for ESP32, RP2040 firmware update via USB (UF2) (work in progress)\n- For future revision: additional RP2040 with PicoProbe fork (2x UART bridge, 1x SWD Debugger + SUMP 16ch login analyser built in)\n- USB Host + Device Mode on USB Type-C connector\n- RP2040 and ESP32 UART exposed\n- In-System debugging of RP2040 via SWD (with VS Code integration)\n- Touch Screen Interface (work in progress)\n- RP2040 running FreeRTOS\n- ESP32 running FreeRTOS<p>You can find some pictures and write up at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.raspberrypi.com&#x2F;viewtopic.php?f=147&amp;t=322135&amp;p=1928264#p1928264",
