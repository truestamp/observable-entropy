NFTs are a new technology that could potentially be applied to the problem of making music profitable again.<p>What if *FRACTIONAL OWNERSHIP* can be the solution?<p>You can read more about my 5-minute report in The Crypto Journal newsletter<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thecryptojournal.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-crypto-journal-issue-002",
