      "text": "My amazon.com account has been put &quot;on hold&quot; over 8 days ago, and I haven&#x27;t been able to get it reopened.<p>I called customer service 10+ times, contacted them using chat through my wife&#x27;s account, etc. Every time they reassured me that they will escalate the issue to their &quot;account specialist&quot; team and they should get back to me within 1-2 days. I waited, nothing happened, called again and repeat. Ive gone through this cycle 6 times already, with no apparent progress.<p>The account was originally put on hold, because their systems thought a gift card balance transaction I made was suspicious. I called them to reassure it wasn&#x27;t and they recorded that info in some form (multiple times).<p>I&#x27;ve had this account for 10+ years, it&#x27;s a safe account with 2-step verification, etc. I have a lot of time invested in this account, but more importantly a lot of money too: audible purchases, prime video purchases, gift card balance, amazon credit card reward points, etc. that I would definitely not want to lose.<p>Has anyone faced similar issues? Any advice on how to get this resolved?<p>Any leads&#x2F;ideas would be greatly appreciated.",
