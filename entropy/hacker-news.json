      "text": "Hi,<p>I am looking to team up with other indie hackers to build some cool projects. I am currently creating a community of tech professionals who can support each other in creating self-standing projects and investing in each other. I have built an MVP that allows for easy collaboration where value added to a project rewards with stake. This stake pays out to all stakeholders when the project makes money. This means no more equity discussions. You get proportionately to what you contribute.<p>The value I can provide coding services for your project, and am currently learning sales.<p>The projects currently under the collaboration tool are making 1 - 2k&#x2F;mo. (starting 1 month ago)<p>If you are interested send me a DM or post a comment!",

      "text": "Since we&#x27;re working from home more often than ever these days, many of us have started to take our day-to-day workflow&#x2F;experience more seriously, and have improved our personal workspaces as a result.<p>What are some of your favorite hacks for improving your day-to-day ease and comfort?<p>For example, in my case, I finally invested in a real DESK, with drawers and everything, as opposed to just having a simple manufactured rectangle table from Walmart. And to improve storage so everything&#x27;s within arm&#x27;s reach most of the time, I bought some adhesive-mounted hooks from the office supply store and mounted them on the inside facing plane, under the desk where my knees and feet are. Now I can keep my BT headphones on a hook, my scissors are there, and a hat for when I don&#x27;t feel like combing my hair but need to be on a webcam :)<p>I fully admit that&#x27;s underwhelming at best, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking. I&#x27;m just looking for ideas to improve my workspace beyond the obvious like &quot;buy a nice chair&quot;, &quot;new monitor&quot;, &quot;input switch&quot;, etc. That stuff&#x27;s all well and good but having already done that, I&#x27;m curious to see what others have come up with. Things that didn&#x27;t even occur to me, that I didn&#x27;t know <i>could</i> be improved, that sorta stuff.<p>So, what are your favorite hacks for your personal workspace? What&#x27;s made your day-to-day more enjoyable?",

      "text": "Looking at the news it&#x27;s ever harder to not get depressed. At least for me. A loud  voice in my head is saying that everything is devolving as far as humans societies are concerned. Crisis after crisis and news showing that everyday people are just breaking up causing havoc around them. And an ever increasing pile of problems waiting to turn into crisis.<p>Under that light my job (marketing analytics sw) seems pointless if not detrimental. But any direction I looked to kind of help out with the things that matter seemed a dead end. There are just no jobs about climate change or school violence. No startups addressing these issues. It seems to me that it is almost impossible to put any effort in what matter which increases the sense of me living in a bubble about to burst at first contact with reality.<p>Dunno. How do feel about all these and bow do you deal with it?",
