However, I am trying to learn as much as I can by reading, googling, and networking about the payments industry. \nIs there a course or certification that you would recommend to establish me as a valuable resource in the Payments Ecosystem?",

I&#x27;m finding various blog posts, and a lot of enterprise-targeted BI tools.<p>Is there any tool that, given a schema, pops out queries? Like June.so for product analytics SQL queries.<p>Rakam looks similar to what I want, but it got bought, and seems to be EOL.",
