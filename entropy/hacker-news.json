      "text": "Just got this email from Coinbase, and it seems one by one the promises of crypto of the last several years are evaporating:<p>Starting on June 27, Coinbase will introduce some changes required by local regulations. Specifically, when you send crypto outside of Coinbase, we are required to ask you for the name and physical address of the recipient and the purpose of transfer. In certain cases we may require you to link a Coinbase Wallet to your main Coinbase account in order to send crypto assets off the Coinbase platform. This allows us to verify that you control the Coinbase Wallet that is receiving the crypto assets.",
