I will start working on a company who&#x27;s main technology is .NET (C# with WPF).<p>My background is Java and Javascript, so I bet I won&#x27;t have to trouble to get hands on with C# itself, but I&#x27;m asking if somebody was in this situation at any time and could give me resources or recomendations for getting as fast as possible up and running with the .NET environment.<p>Thanks!",
