My laptop (a surface tablet) is great except for some heavy desktop usage. I definitely don&#x27;t want to buy a desktop or full laptop  here due to traveling soon but I was wondering if there is a good paid powerful remote virtual machine I can rent for desktop type of usage, like a remote desktop as a service? My budget is ideally $50-$100&#x2F;month but could go a little higher.<p>What is your recommendation?",
