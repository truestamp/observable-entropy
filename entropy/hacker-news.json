Like the Azure&#x2F;AWS online console for example.<p>Specifically, what do you like about the current online portal you use, what options do they give you, and what are things you hate in the online portal?<p>At the end, what makes you pick a service provider over another after you test the water with the online portal for Kubernetes at AWS, Azure, or GCP for that matter.",
