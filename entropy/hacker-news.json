      "text": "Hey all,<p>I wanted to share with you this cool platform for developers that lets you build conversational AI apps in a matter of hours. Even a non-developer can build a demo app in less than 2 hours.<p>Why is Dasha unique?<p>* We have our own intuitive programming language - DashaScript. It&#x27;s an event-driven language intended to describe a conversation script.<p>* We created Dasha Studio, an extension to VSCode. You use the studio to create your conversational script, it gives you syntax analysis and highlight. There&#x27;s also a visual graph editor.<p>* Dasha CLI that lets you log in and get your API key that you can then use to execute conversational AI apps, and get diagnostic information about current usage, queues, and limits on Dasha Cloud Platform side.<p>* Dasha Cloud provides conversational AI as a service, which means that you don’t need to be a machine learning engineer to use machine learning when building Dasha conversational apps.<p>We use GRPC for communication between SDK and the Dasha Cloud (more on that here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dasha.ai&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;conversational-application)<p>What apps can you build?<p>To illustrate how to build a conversational app and show its capabilities, here&#x27;s an audio demo + tutorial on how to create a conversational AI app that automates hotel front desk receptionist tasks (and more): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dasha.ai&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ai-hotel-front-desk<p>You can create apps for free, so give it a try: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dasha.ai&#x2F;en-us&#x2F; (just click on &quot;API key&quot; button and we&#x27;ll provide you one so you can start building)<p>Also, we&#x27;re hiring a DevRel, so if you are one or know one, apply or reach out!  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;dashaai&#x2F;Dasha-is-hiring-6f2156ae251e4e9b94c841fff4fcd976",
