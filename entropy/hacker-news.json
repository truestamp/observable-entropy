Before that I used solely mooc materials or textbooks. I have found that reading every recent paper from a topic is not possible and discovering decent projects is almost impossible.<p>Recently I discovered : HanLab e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hanlab.mit.edu&#x2F;projects&#x2F;ofa&#x2F;<p>It&#x27;s decent but finding these kind of labs seems difficult. I couldn&#x27;t find it listed on any MIT website. Stumbled upon it link to link.",
