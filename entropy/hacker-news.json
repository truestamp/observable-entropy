      "text": "I read your post from 2018 where you used Himalayan sea salt cleanses and it made a remarkable difference in your condition.  My 35 year old son is suffering from sibo and has been through multiple rounds of antibiotics, herbals, elemental diets, etc.  He has just had the 3rd day of salt cleanse and we are cautiously optimistic that his gas&#x2F;bloat is way down.  Can you tell us more about how you are feeling?  Whether you really found a cure for yourself?  Do you still do the salt cleanses?  I would very much appreciate your response.  I have been watching him suffer so badly with trapped bloat and his whole system is affected...brain fog, etc.  This guy was a stand up comedian and bartender before Covid.",
