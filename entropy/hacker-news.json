      "text": "So, I was reading Stack Overflow The Architecture - 2016 Edition [0] and one picture [1] shocked me. Five minutes ago I was reading about the IBM 360 mainframe (not sure how I ended in its Wikipedia entry). Anyway, the IBM 360 was big (big, for today standards of course), heavy and costly; my iPhone is a thousand times faster and fits in my pocket. So why did [1] shock me? I was thinking: &quot;so, 50 years ago we had this IBM 360 thing, and now we have iPhones that are way more powerful. So, in 50 years would we be able to have a computer that fits in our pocket that has everything needed to deploy Stack Overflow?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure the rack in picture [1] is decent for today&#x27;s standards but I couldn&#x27;t help but think &quot;wow, that rack looks, big, heavy and costly!&quot;.<p>I was thinking about availability, performance, redundancy, security, etc. Do you think it would be possible to host the entire Stack Overflow site in my &quot;2070 mobile phone&quot; and serve with it millions of visitors as performant and secure as the current SO does?<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickcraver.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition&#x2F;<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickcraver.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;content&#x2F;SO-Architecture&#x2F;SO-Architecture-RackB-Bottom.webp",
