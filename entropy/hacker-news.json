That&#x27;s why HN is so popular, a lot of stimulating stuff everyday.<p>What websites that aggregate content do you enjoy and what are some good implementations you&#x27;ve seen?<p>I am interested in making my own. \nAs well as a open source software that streamlines the process of setting up a particular themed aggregate. Where the maintainer would just have to configure new sources and moderate comments essentiually. But this is just in the brainstorming stage ATM.<p>Also will be attempting automated classification of the data to organize it a bit better, while keeping hands off. Looking at stuff like openai.com for that.",
