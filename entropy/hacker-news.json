      "text": "This might just be me as I remember rolling my eyes the first time I heard about &quot;cloud&quot; and I still think it&#x27;s just somebody&#x27;s else computers. Don&#x27;t start me on &quot;private cloud&quot;.<p>I find IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, WYSIWYG, etc a lot more accurate.<p>The server or the code not being visible to you and the fact that you can&#x27;t work directly on them does not mean they do not exist. You just buy&#x2F;rent an abstraction on top of them and you are still very much paying for the servers and the code. The server infrastructure still has &lt; 100% SLA, the code still has bugs, etc.<p>Modern cars require pretty much no setup or maintenance of the engine by the driver. The engine is mostly successfully abstracted away. Would it be accurate to call modern cars &quot;engineless&quot;? Using a Taxi or a furniture moving company does not require you to own a car. That&#x27;s the point of those services. But nobody describes those things as &quot;no-car&quot;.<p>All this might seem as nitpicking but I don&#x27;t think it is. I think the terms are intentionally misleading. What is your sentiment?",
