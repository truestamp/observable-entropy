(Financial statements specifically: Cash  Flow Statement, Income Statement, Balance Sheet)<p>I have struggled to find a vendor that ticks all of the following, and looking for suggestions:<p>1. OCR of financial statements of individual companies\n1. Maintain a custom &quot;Chart of Accounts&quot; for each company, which is customisable by a credit analyst role\n1. Ability to create persistent rules for each company\n1. Bonus to be able to connect directly via API or API aggregator if the company will agree to this (eg Xero API or codat API aggregator) to pull real time raw ledger and build the accounts.<p>NB - Not looking for OCR of invoices, bank statements and receipts, that is quite commonly available",
