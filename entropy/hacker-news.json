      "text": "I recently started a new job where I&#x27;m building a website and some software infrastructure for a brand new company. I have been a professional developer for over a decade and worked in many teams large and small, as well as both business and tech driven orgs.<p>The company exists because the person who founded another organization got some investment and now he&#x27;s moving forward with part of the business the investment org isn&#x27;t interested in.<p>The challenge I have is that I&#x27;m a very software &#x2F; technical oriented person who is used to thinks like Slack, emailing to setup appointments and scheduling things in the future.<p>I am working with a group of people who are older than me who prefer email and telephone over anything else. Rather than scheduling time to talk they will just call each other up at random times. Often I will send emails with direct requests asking &quot;what time is good for everyone?&quot; and not receive a response at all. I want to plead with the team for better communications but I have not been at the organization long enough to have the political capital to make this happen.<p>Can anybody suggest articles &#x2F; books &#x2F; materials that might help me figure out how to best communicate with this audience? These are not new challenges but I&#x27;m failing to describe it to Google in a way that gives me any meaningful responses.<p>Thanks",
