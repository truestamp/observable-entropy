      "text": "This is directed at those hardworking forum admins among you. Please relax your rules on necroposting. A common scenario is someone asking how to do something. At the time, it either gets answered sub-optimally or not at all. Over time, it manages to get to top of the search engine results (why? no idea! but it does far too often). New solutions now exist but the forum admin has decided to lock down the thread to avoid necroposting, essentially wasting the SEO advantage they have unintentionally gained by not allowing useful answers to be posted, and subsequently making it harder for people to find answers.<p>Necroposting is definitely not that great in general, but there are circumstances where it&#x27;s very helpful.",
