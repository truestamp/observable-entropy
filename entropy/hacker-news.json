      "text": "Firefox starts blocking uBlock Origin and other ad-blocking add-ons in China on addons.mozilla.org<p>Recently [1], some users reported that uBlock Origin [2], AdGuard AdBlocker [3], AdBlock For Firefox [4], and AdNauseam [5] were restricted from being accessed by users in mainland China.<p>When users in mainland China try to access the above ad-filtering add-ons on addons.mozilla.org, the website returns 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons instead of the normal 200 OK response, and the body of the page states &quot;This page is not available in your region&quot;.<p>The facts can be validated by reproducing the test results below.<p>Worth to note: This has nothing to do with China&#x27;s &quot;great firewall&quot;. This action of blocking was solely performed by Firefox in China, because the website &quot;addons.mozilla.org&quot; is accessible in China and it&#x27;s not blocked by China&#x27;s &quot;great firewall&quot;. Firefox in China has a long history of arbitrarily blocking websites even for non-political or legal reasons and was actually found guilty by the Court in China back in 2018 for several such cases.<p>Sources and evidences:<p>[1] According to Blocky&#x27;s test logs, restricted access initially began no earlier than March 8, 2022 and no later than March 19, 2022.\nUsers report: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bgme.me&#x2F;@bgme&#x2F;107986773834355287<p>Testing results (by blocky.greatfire.org)<p>Before: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blocky.greatfire.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;url_test_result&#x2F;18800410?format=ooni<p>After: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blocky.greatfire.org&#x2F;api&#x2F;url_test_result&#x2F;18861443?format=ooni<p>The same testing results can be reproduced by testing the below URLs from a China mainland IP address or blocky.greatfire.org which uses multiple China mainland IP addresses in different cities.<p>Affected add-ons:<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;zh-CN&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;ublock-origin&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;zh-CN&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;adguard-adblocker&#x2F;<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;zh-CN&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;adblock-for-firefox&#x2F;<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;zh-CN&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;adnauseam&#x2F;<p>Court cases about Firefox&#x27;s malpractices in China:<p>（2017）京0101民初4609号<p>（2018）京73民终433号<p>（2017）京0101民初4608号<p>（2018）京73民终397号",
