      "text": "It’s not that hard to figure out what kind of illnesses impact the most people or have the largest impacts. We don’t really need the market to “decide” where resources should be allocated.<p>Governments could issue bounties for drugs that treat diseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc. Rewards would be based on effectiveness, side effects, how many people are effected, and how severe the illness is. Patents go into the open domain. And while a lot of money might flow to new treatments for big killers like heart disease early on, in later years, other “orphan diseases” would get attention once the higher priorities are better dealt with. Publishing failed research could be incentivized too.<p>Is there something I’m missing here? Has any nation considered doing this?",
