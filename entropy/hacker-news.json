      "text": "I&#x27;ve been really struggling with my personal goals recently. Some days I have the energy to work out, eat healthy, work on personal projects, etc... But more often than not I feel totally dead and struggle to do more than the bare minimum. What are your strategies to maintain consistent motivation and productivity?<p>I feel like a fraud because even though I&#x27;ve made good progress on traditional goals (finished university, have a decent paying job, married, have a kid, hoping to buy a house soon) I feel stuck and unable to move forward. Apologies if this is an inappropriate topic for HN but any advice&#x2F;resources would be greatly appreciated.",
