      "text": "We have been working on multy.dev, an open-source cloud agnostic API that makes it easy to deploy the same infrastructure to any cloud provider using native managed services.<p>The motivation was the realisation that, even when using Terraform, migrating infrastructure code requires an end-to-end re-write. Even though most core resources are the same in any major cloud, developers need to learn a new provider to deploy the same infrastructure when moving providers.<p>We are still in early days of development and currently support the core services from AWS and Azure:<p>- Networking (virtual_network, subnet, route_table, security_group, network_interface, public_ip)<p>- Compute (virtual_machine, managed kubernetes)<p>- Database (managed MySQL databases)<p>- Vault (managed secrets)<p>- Storage (managed storage)<p>- Abstraction of cloud differences (Azure VM public vs AWS EC2 private by default)<p>- Deployment through Terraform<p>We’re looking for feedback from other developers about our approach. Let us know your thoughts!<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;multycloud&#x2F;multy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;multycloud&#x2F;multy</a>",
