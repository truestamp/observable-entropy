It can even be more precise: &quot;a wood stove and firewood market Webapp that connects manufacturers and customers&quot;.<p>But I need to know if people would be interested in paying to use this site, and if lots of people would use it.<p>I also need to imagine highly-specialized features that would interest manufacturers that they would not find nowhere (and idem for customers), so that my Webapp would have a real added value.<p>What are the steps to follow to answer those questions?\nCould I simply go to their forums and asks them their needs?",
