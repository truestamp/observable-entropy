I&#x27;ve applied all the time, almost no callbacks (only Facebook, I failed the interview but in my defense I was severely sleep deprived due to nerves).<p>I always wanted to work in the US simply because I&#x27;ve been growing up with a part of the culture since the internet existed and because the pay seems to be better.<p>I feel only people who&#x27;ve been working on both sides can comment the situation to answer the question: should I be careful what I wish for here? (aka better pay, experiencing US culture)<p>I believe more people are in my situation.",
