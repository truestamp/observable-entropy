      "text": "Last week, I went to McDonald’s and got a Filet-O-Fish combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. I was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audiobook when I glanced up and saw the McDonald’s worker I ordered to outside having a cigarette.<p>She waved at me and I nodded and had to wait 7 minutes before she went back inside and I could finally eat in comfort again. I don’t think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the McDonald’s restaurant or drive through… but that is another story.<p>Anyways, I went to McDonald’s for dinner tonight and got a McChicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side. As I was driving to the second window, I noticed the same girl was still working. She was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting to small talk when she asked, “why don’t you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot anon?”<p>That really bothered me for many reasons. First of all, I don’t want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee. Secondly, she should not try to tell me how to live my life. I do not want to eat inside because I find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy.<p>Overall, I think it was very unprofessional to bring this up. I should have a clean slate with each drive through visit, not have to get the third degree because I committed some sort of “faux pas”. Which I don’t think I did, because I often see other people eating in fast food parking lots. How does she know I am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush?<p>How do you guys feel about eating in your vehicle in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant versus eating inside the restaurant?",
