      "text": "with some help from a developer. Five years ago, I was at a meeting at Smith College, my aluma mater. We were discussing some issues and wondered, how are the alums and current students of the other Seven Sisters Colleges (Wellesley, Smith, Mt Holyoke, Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Vassar &amp; Radcliffe)on these issues. Came home started a facebook page that grew to 10,000 people in a few weeks. From that, there was a demand, need that people wanted to meet other Seven Sisters, worked with a developer to build this membership website. Its free to join and we have over 10,000 members. Theres a Newsletter, over 70 facebook groups, a 14,000 person job board and in-person&#x2F;virtual events. In totatl, we have over 53,000 people engaging in a part of our network. Overall, there are 250,000 Seven Sisters alums in the world, so there is room to grow &amp; people are graduating from the colleges every year. I guess my question is, how do I take a) my website to the next level b) continue to grow and get some sort of funding, as this has been self-funded and I am, essentially the jack of all trades. www.sevensistersalumnaeassociation.com is the website HELP!",
