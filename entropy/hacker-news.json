      "text": "When I say Europe I mean the EU + UK. This is one of the richest, most developed, and most prosperous regions in the world. Most citizens have access to free (but under strain) health services.<p>Europe is also fortunate to be sitting on an enormous stockpile of vaccines (while many other less weathly countries are still waiting patiently).<p>Given all the above, why did Europe suffer so greatly from the pandemic given its plentiful resources? Even the collection of statistics vary wildly from country to country and even within countries. (From under-reporting to over-estimates, to calculating excess deaths - will we ever know the true death toll directly and indirectly through COVID?)<p>One again, Europe is the epicentre of COVID as omicron spreads like wildfire around the continent.<p>Scientists and health workers have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. So is it the political response to the pandemic where most blame rests? Or it that simplifying an enormously complex topic?",
