The band teacher had one in his office.<p>And I was tempted toward random knob twisting today when I saw yet another &#x27;analog&#x27; synthesizer runnable in the browser.<p>But I&#x27;d really like to have some basic idea of how to put together rudimentary sounds with intent.<p>I was wondering about book like objects that explain the basics. Maybe a good used book to pick up. Thanks.",
