This scale has no user-accessible battery, yet it reliably displays my weight every time I step on it.  I also have a MFA authentication card, recently acquired from a software vendor which requires MFA for login (TOTP), it is the exact size of every credit card I&#x27;ve ever had, so there is no apparent battery.  Yet the LCD display on the card displays every time I press the &quot;button&quot;. How is it that these LCD displays can work with no apparent source of electric power?",
