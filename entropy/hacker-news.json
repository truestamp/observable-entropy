      "text": "7 years ago I’ve written a poem about my life as a bipolar person.\nI never had the courage to show it to anyone - so I would like to write this post the way I would have written it back then.<p>Hello.<p>I have bipolar disorder.<p>So, what is like to be bipolar? \nIt’s a difficult question to answer. First of all, every bipolar person is different. Medical literature distinguishes 5 core types of Bipolar Disorders(BP1, 2, Cyclothymic, mixed and rapid changing), but I think it’s better to think of it as music: it’s useful to classify songs into genres, but even within the same genre the songs can sound completely different.\nThe same goes for people with bipolar disorder - we might have the same diagnosis, but we all experience and navigate our condition in unique ways. \nI don’t just mean that we have different episodes, with different triggers, duration, intensity, feelings, …etc. \nOf course we do.\nBut it goes much deeper than that. \nIt’s the way we reason about it, the way we try to make sense of it and integrate it into our lives. Ask 10 people with bipolar disorder - and you will get 10 unique narratives.<p>This poem is about my personal experience.<p>I invite you to read it - it’s a small window into my life - just one song in the musical genre of “Bipolar”.<p>I welcome all your comments, good or bad! :)<p>Here it is:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;k-i-t-s-u-n-e.github.io&#x2F;again<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shorturl.at&#x2F;esLOY<p>Thank you.",
