Moving to an industry that tries to build a future - not a better future, just a future - is quite challenging without a meaningful background in hard sciences. &quot;Think globally, act locally&quot; is a dogma I&#x27;ve been following since forever but it feels insufficient when it comes to some of the great challenges we are going to face soon.<p>Help me and others like me see the world with different eyes.",
