      "text": "I have recently started to look for a Full-stack development job around Canada, preferably in Toronto or Vancouver. I am currently based in Europe (EU citizen) and would like to relocate in the near future. I have around 8 years of experience (Barclays IB, GE Healthcare, IBM, startups), and have an Engineering IT BSc from 2014, which makes me eligible to apply for a work visa.<p>Can anyone recommend some job sites or even companies worth reaching out to? Linkedin does not seem to work for this particular case.<p>Thanks!",
