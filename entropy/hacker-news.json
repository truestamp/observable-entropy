      "text": "Hello to all the HN community! It&#x27;s Nik here, I founded WeLoveNoCode (welovenocode.com), a platform that connects people with the best no-code developers to build their software and apps without a single line of code. All that is based on a monthly subscription.<p>My startup just raised $1M in funding and we reached a monthly recurring revenue of $170k+ within less than a year. I have learned a lot from other makers here, So I decided to also share my experience about building a startup that is growing at rocket speed. I hope this helps other entrepreneurs (and if you are looking to join a fast-growth startup, Iâ€™m hiring).<p>So, how did we achieve this kind of growth in a short time? I drafted some important lessons I learned and would like to share them with you.<p>Now, let&#x27;s dive deeper in comments:",
