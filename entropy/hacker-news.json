Yuck.<p>Most alternatives (enabled by logging frameworks) is a logfile is ... ok, but then you have logfiles polluting your FS in arbitrary locations, and the logfile location and name is going to be highly unstandardized.<p>So why isn&#x27;t there a standard notion of stdlog in UNIXland alongside stdin, stdout, and stderr?",

[1]<p>Hobby Basic tier is meant for &quot;Small side projects and proof-of-concepts&quot; [2]. It&#x27;s possible for a startup to spend a lot of time in this tier because it spans from tiny (10k rows, to quite large 10m rows). Many startups reach $m valuations with smaller databases.<p>What happened to:<p>&gt; Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.<p>If your db admin&#x27;s takes a week&#x27;s holidays, they could return and find the database missing.<p>An unexpected grown surge could push your db past its limits earlier than anticipated and an alert email could easily be missed.<p>Heroku&#x27;s own infrastructure could go down at an inopportune time, preventing maintenance. For example heroku&#x27;s <i>database metrics page</i> is currently not displaying database metrics for some databases - including for this one with 7 days to live.
