      "text": "Hi all,<p>I am a junior dev switching jobs soon, and while I tend to do well on leetcode questions, I sometimes hit a question where I need to use a priority queue or an array method that sorts a certain way, and I have to google it to find it.<p>How best can I learn some of the names of array methods (like partial_sort) or math functions (like sqrt() )?  Do I just need to keep doing leetcode until I am exposed to all of them or are there places that list commonly used methods&#x2F;libraries?<p>I do most of my leetcode in C++, but I am sure people looking at this thread would also love to see Java and Python resources as well.",
