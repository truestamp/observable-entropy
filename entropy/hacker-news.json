      "text": "I am trying to be prepared for the eventual failure of my older Apple Time Capsule. It has been a pretty good router, done most of what I asked and functioned as a steadfast device for almost a decade. I don&#x27;t foresee it breaking, but I would like to be prepared for the future. I am looking for router suggestions that have the following features:<p>1) No Wifi needed, I have a separate AP for that.<p>2) Have 1-2 2.5 Gb ports that don&#x27;t require link aggregation if possible. One of my future goes is to try and get a home NAS that is capable of doing 2.5Gb.<p>3) Have 1-2 SFP+ ports so that I can connect a switch or two. Another future goal is to connect a couple of switches, one with PoE+ and one without, though I will admit this may not be necessary if I am not going the 10 Gb route which I am on the fence on.<p>4) Allow for 5-10 port forward entries and at least 20-30 MAC address reservations.<p>5) Rack mountable<p>I have been leaning towards MicroTik, in particular their new RB5009UG+S+IN<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mikrotik.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;rb5009ug_s_in<p>However, I have no experience using their router OS and if it will provide the options I am looking for. Any thoughts would be appreciated.<p>Thank you!",
