If you search HN or the web in general, you barely find success stories around having a freemium model. In fact, it really seems to hurt most products as it lowers the perceived value. And because of having an endless trial, users seem to try much less to explore and make things work for them.<p>Here’s just one recent article about a company that added a free account retrospectively and pretty much ruined their conversions&#x2F;sales for a while: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;recurly.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;hard-lessons-learned-in-the-land-of-the-freemium&#x2F;<p>Full disclosure: My startup is offering a free account as well, and we’re actively considering to remove it.",

But for the first time, I feel like I&#x27;m lacking the basics to perform adequately.<p>So far, it seems that most of the resources I have been consulting are very <i>opinionated</i>, i.e. in many areas, there seem to be too much <i>flexibility</i>, at least compared to other programming languages and&#x2F;or frameworks.<p>I have to take a quite long flight in a few hours, and I would love to dive in a book (books?) that could help me bridge the gap between what I now know, i.e. Java + Spring, Python + Flask, a bit of Rust + Rocket, etc., and what I need to know, this being modern Typescript, Node.js, and React programming.<p>Thanks in advance folks.",
