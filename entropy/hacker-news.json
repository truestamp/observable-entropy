      "text": "I recently (possibly via HN?) came across a random webpage (mostly informal&#x2F; personal-blog-like in nature, as I recall), which was demonstrating a nice pattern made up of tiny colourful rotating shapes. I think this was a javascript-d3 applet (I think --- I remember it was not just an image or video, it had to load the &#x27;applet&#x27; ... but I&#x27;m not sure. It may also have been python code that one would have to download and run ...)<p>I don&#x27;t remember if the page specifically mentioned the word &#x27;scotoma&#x27; per se, but I remember the author hinted that this pattern was really good for detecting it, and it really was! I could see my own scotoma boundaries extremely clearly. First time it was so clear.<p>I have seen other things that enable me to visualise it (e.g. the black-white-squares test mentioned here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.mssociety.org.uk&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-to-see-a-scotoma&#x2F;1980), but these are nowhere near as clear as that page was.<p>I was wondering if anybody knows the page I&#x27;m talking about and could link to it here?",
