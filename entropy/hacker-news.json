      "text": "I’m considering starting a kayak rental service in my local area and would like to price out purchasing boats directly from a manufacturer rather than a consumer sporting goods store (REI, Dicks, etc).<p>All of the plastic manufacturer I’ve contacted up to this point stated they do not produce kayaks.<p>Could anyone here help point me in the direction of a company that sells kayaks off of the production line, or in bulk?<p>I know this isn’t the usual HN type of question, but this is a pretty resourceful community. Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.",

However, the company now believes developers don&#x27;t need QA since they can do their own testing.  Devs should write code, do all their unit, int, system testings, run their code reviews, save testing artifacts, and work with key stakeholders across the company to close requirements gaps etc.  We&#x27;re basically the entire sdlc minus devops.<p>This is great for small features, but it gives me pause for mid or large features.
