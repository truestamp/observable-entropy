      "text": "Why are there no good note taking apps on github or elsewhere that you can self host? Its really not that hard but almost all of them miss some crucial points.<p>I tried CodiMD, HedgeDoc, Jooplin, Standard Notes, Trillium and a few others.<p>- Use Markdown or plaintext for notes. This way they are easy to edit and display in almost everything. Don&#x27;t render anything automatically for me if i don&#x27;t want to (Trillium im looking at you FFS).\n- Let me use folders (im looking at you CodiMD, Hedgedoc, ...) - who in the world doesn&#x27;t want to organize notes in any way? I don&#x27;t need graphs or LaTeX, i need folders and tags and references and ways to organize myself.\n- Offer a Web Editor with proper account and user management (CodiMD, HedgeDoc, ...) and a custom landing page if you offer one at all. Let me setup accounts for other people and let me choose who i want to share notes with and who can edit them - just like nextcloud does. I dont need a Web Editor but its a really nice feature so why not implement it in a useful way that its actually managable?\n- Let me share notes online. Let me generate a Link that i can send others. Let them either enter a password or make it possible to revoke the link and genereate a new one or set a time limit for sharing. Bonus points if the notes are stored encrypted and are shared E2E with the password in the URL just like Mega did. I wouldn&#x27;t even need a Web Editor if i got this instead.\n(- Dont use some over the top database structure or framework if not &lt;really&gt; needed)<p>I feel like most of those note taking app creators dont even use their own product. Also i dont care about a fancy looking UI that uses 8GB of RAM and takes 10 Seconds to load, just make it work.",
