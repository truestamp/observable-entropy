      "text": "Hi all,<p>I just got att fiber installed and I&#x27;m having trouble loading youtube videos on firefox.<p>On some videos it load no problem, on others the network activity is 0 (on stats for nerds) and it wont load at all. I&#x27;ve tried changing my dns, clearing cache, turning off ipv6 on the router,turning off hardware acceleration, disabling adblocker, forcing h264 and signing out.<p>The time of day doesn&#x27;t seem to matter either. Videos work flawlessly on opera so I can use that but I&#x27;m curious if anyone has had this issue and possible solutions.",
