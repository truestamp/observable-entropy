      "text": "Hi HN,<p>There is a medication for a rare disease, which typically costs more than 6 figures, that I know is having its patent expiring soon.<p>I would love for generic drug makers (ones in India for example) to come in and start making the drug for cheaper so it is more affordable for families.<p>However, because it is a rare disease, I don&#x27;t know if a drug maker would normally be incentivized to do this. But given the sky high costs of the drug pre patent expiration, I think there might be enough demand there for makers to make decent profit.<p>Say I wanted to give them a nudge, or maybe I get some people who I know are ready to pay for it if they make them, showing to the generic makers the demand is there. Does anyone know how I should go about this or if it&#x27;s possible? Aside from the obvious, e.g. start emailing around and asking the manufacturers, does anyone have experience with this and know what to look out for?<p>And also I&#x27;m aware that regulations and things are a whole different issue but I&#x27;m currently just asking around hypothetically.",
