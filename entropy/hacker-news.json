      "text": "I am looking for tooling that can be used to create comprehensive, explanatory blog posts on scientific papers in the field of deep learning. The blog posts themselves should meet the basic requirements of scientific work, so it would be helpful, for example, if citations were supported.<p>I first thought about Jupyter Notebooks, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s suitable for writing longer texts, and it also lacks citation management. Another idea would be Bookdown, but then the result looks more like a book than a blog.\nI am grateful for recommendations!",
