      "text": "This really surprised me... cyclists will _regularly_ spend $400+ on a cycling &quot;head unit&quot; that is just a dumbed down smartphone to give them turn-by-turn directions, record data from sensors, and work as a HUD.<p>The only advantage of a head unit is they have an ANT+ radio, which is a superior protocol than BLE for data gathering. Nowadays, nearly every sensor has dual mode BLE&#x2F;ANT+.<p>Shimano has ETube Ride, which is about the closest thing I can find to a replacement, but it lacks a critical feature to be able to import a route. It does connect to BLE speed&#x2F;candence&#x2F;DI2 transmission however, but does not connect to a BLE heart rate monitor ironically.<p>Other apps like Strava will do routing, but only connect to BLE HeartRate sensors, and don&#x27;t connect to speed&#x2F;cadence&#x2F;DI2 (electronic bike transmission).<p>It seems like nobody has the whole package. Am I missing something? Just seems like an obvious hole in the ecosystem a startup should have filled by now.",
