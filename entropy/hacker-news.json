      "text": "Hi,<p>We are a for-purpose startup building a marketplace to help people find local physical activity groups, clubs and trainers that match their needs. The idea is to build a resource for people, councils and local healthcare providers looking to help more people get active with plenty of free, low-cost and paid options.<p>A lot of these groups are operated by non-profits such as ParkRun and associations such as State Football Associations.<p>Our strategy:\n1. Offer free listings for 6 months to get lots of free and low cost providers onboard to establish the marketplace\n2. Get help with councils and healthcare providers to promote the marketplace\n3. See interest in marketplace, learn and then establish pricing<p>Thoughts on this strategy? Also, do we need to establish pricing from day #1 or can we simply state we are in a 6 month trial period and we will announce pricing towards end of trial?",
