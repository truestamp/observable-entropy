      "text": "I am talking about self taught people. And by really good I imply good knowledge of CS fundamentals so that when they write code it looks and runs elegantly. Performance is thought about and also readability. We know CS is about computational problem solving not just about programming.<p>Most guides out there say do this course or learn this language or may be do some web development and you are a programmer. I know it works to a certain extent but doesn&#x27;t achieve anything beyond a certain threshold.<p>Is it possible for someone to self study CS from available materials like good books, public course contents? To such an extent that they have solid grounding in CS fundamentals, learns programming as a tool and become good at it gradually and when needed can venture into a sub-domain and learn about it using the skills already obtained previously to solve problems computationally.<p>Has anyone here done that? Can you share your journey? Or are there any documented blogs or something?<p>No offence to &quot;web developers&quot;, but I am not looking for advice like learn this framework, this is hot. I want transferrable skills.",
