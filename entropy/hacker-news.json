      "text": "Hello! I&#x27;d like to ask if you&#x27;d be willing to talk to us about painful vendor migrations that you&#x27;ve experienced.<p>I&#x27;ve done tons of messy migration work in the past (ERPs, credit card processors, shipping&#x2F;warehouse services) at large companies. I&#x27;m thinking of striking out on my own and forming a company to focus on just that: automating away messy work that normally require consultants.<p>Can you tell share your horror stories about vendor changes that stick out in your mind as painful, or required consultants, or that you want to change but feel stuck?<p>Here are some examples:<p>- Shipping and logistics. For example, supporting both UPS and FedEx, changing shipping couriers, using a 3PL, changing warehouses<p>- E-Commerce. Switching from Squarespace to Shopfiy, or from brick-and-mortar to online. Supporting both Seamless and Doordash.<p>- Content. Wordpress to Contentful, or Squarespace to Wix.<p>- Payments. Adding PayPal support, or moving from PayPal to Stripe. Migrating away from Vantiv, or on to Authorize.<p>- ERP. Moving from Quickbooks to Netsuite.<p>- HR. Moving from ADP -&gt; Gusto. Culture Amp to Lattice. Fidelity to Vanguard for managing defined benefits.<p>- BI tools. Adopting Looker. Or shifting from Postgres to Redshift.<p>- File storage. Migrating from S3 to GCP. Moving your org from Google Drive to Dropbox.<p>- Productivity. Monday to JIRA. Confluence to Notion.<p>- Cloud infrastructure. Cloud migrations: multi-cloud deployments, or changing your containerization deployment strategy. Moving from GCP to AWS. Consolidating your domain registrations.<p>- Communication. Gmail to Outlook. Mailgun to Sendgrid. Hipchat to Slack.<p>What was painful? Where did you start looking for consultants to do the work? What migration made your team start looking for new jobs? Where do you feel completely stuck but it&#x27;s too much work to move?",

      "text": "Hey Hackers,<p>A desperate call for feedback here.<p>I must be doing something utterly wrong.<p>After working for 5+ years in tech recruitment and having built a profitable company in the space generating $1M+ ARR - I finally admit that I know nothing about this market.<p>For the last 2 months I and my co-founder have been working on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenlight.jobs&#x2F;employers&#x2F; - a marketplace that connects businesses with vetted overseas engineers looking for remote work opportunities. It is a &#x27;reverse&#x27; job marketplace, where &#x27;poachable&#x27; candidates list their anonymized profiles. As a result, employers see available candidates immediately - which shortens time-to-hire many times. It also gives businesses access to the new and huge &#x27;hidden&#x27; pool of talent.<p>I had great faith in this idea for at least 3 reasons:\n1) Post-COVID, hiring engineers became even tougher than before. \n2) Remote becomes the new normal - and consequently international hiring is on the rise, with companies like Deel or Remote - that provide paperwork and payroll for foreign employees, surpassing billion-dollar valuations;\n3) There are tens of thousands of brilliant engineers on local markets that speak decent English, and are happy to work for an American startup for $100K-120K + equity.<p>We have seen a lot of entusiasm from candidates - and quickly got a strong first batch of senior React+Node full-stack developers.<p>However after we launched the employers website - the interest turned to be surprisingly low. We got only 4 job postings so far, 1 from last weeks&#x27; Show HN (4 upvotes, 3 comments) and 3 from Bookface. \nToday Greenlight launched on Product Hunt - and got only 29 upvotes so far.<p>I strongly believe in the vision of work knowing no borders on the future - so don&#x27;t want to give up on this easily. \nI would therefore be grateful for any piece of feedback that would help me understand what may we be missing.<p>Thanks!",
