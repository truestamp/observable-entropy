It isn&#x27;t uncommon for me to learn way more about the subject matter from comments than from the post itself.<p>Are there other communities, online or off, with a similar balance between the quality of the original source material (whatever that means in context) and the responses to it? For example: an online forum dedicated to an esoteric interest; a book club or writing group; your local bicycle repair shop; etc.<p>(A lot of workplaces probably exhibit this balance, but let&#x27;s leave them out of the definition of &quot;communities&quot; for the purposes of this post.)",
