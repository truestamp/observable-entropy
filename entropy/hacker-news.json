I&#x27;m looking for a job that produces actual scientific value rather than just rat-racing along my coworkers.<p>Thanks to anybody that cares to chime in",

It seems great for lots of uses cases like planning, drafting, etc.. or even outlining&#x2F;mind-mapping.<p>I discovered it via a Hacker News comment and so thought to share and also curious to hear your impressions on it? \nTo me, it feels like a very elegant interface to use; there is minimal visual clutter, no menu, just the tools (rectangle, square, etc..). The controls are intuitive (can easily create shapes, add text, resize and add connections).",
