      "text": "I am Wasim, Founder of Real Life Apps. I have spent the past 3 years building my startup, team and products. Without a doubt, it has been the most difficult journey of my life. Our mission was to make getting things done as simple as sending a snap or a tweet. To make productivity both cool and social. I believe we have realized this goal. I would be grateful if you take our app for a spin and give us your feedback. The app is named Looksee and is completely free.<p>Looksee is an innovative Social Productivity app. The app allows people to get things done through a friendly visual presentation rather than old-fashioned “to-do” lists. As a visual person, I was tired of tedious checklists and text-based tools like Notion, Evernote, Todoist etc. That inspired me to create Looksee which uses the power of visuals (photos or video) to capture any task. Looksee enables the user to manage their own tasks, as well as delegate to others in their social circles<p>Looksee merges two completely different genres of apps, Social Networking and Productivity, into a new breakthrough category of “Social Productivity.”<p>Here is a 1-minute video that explains Looksee:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gfBK9L_woH0<p>Looksee is live on the Apple App Store. Here is a direct link:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;looksee&#x2F;id1535769409<p>We are a small tech startup based in Austin, Texas. As a founder, I am requesting the community&#x27;s help, advice &amp; feedback!<p>Thank you so much,<p>Dr. Wasim Irshad<p>PhD Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering (Purdue University)<p>CEO &amp; Founder of Real Life Apps (www.reallifeapp.com)",
