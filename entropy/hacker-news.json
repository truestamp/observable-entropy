      "text": "No I don&#x27;t think its imposter syndrome. I got into tech a few years ago because I find building cool stuff, especially clone apps, to be really fun. It&#x27;s like legos for me, and I build a bunch of projects using various technologies so I keep learning some new frameworks and languages. I feel good working on all sorts of applications, from backend to web and mobile apps.<p>Unfortunately I tried to do some mock interviews (leetcode) and got demolished. I have been practicing for the last couple of months, but I just cannot solve a single medium problem on my own without looking at some help and even then it is hard for me. I think that I&#x27;m hitting my limits because I&#x27;m finding that I am not that good at actually &quot;programming&quot;. I have a hard time thinking about some of these problems, because I can&#x27;t comprehend the question itself.<p>I can build UIs, or build a backend api application deployed on some cloud provider, but I don&#x27;t know I just can&#x27;t seem to do actual programming like the stuff you do with leetcode. This has made me really question myself and my abilities, and I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m supposed to find a better job when I can&#x27;t get past the technical screening.<p>I&#x27;m depressed because I make a decent base salary but I don&#x27;t really know how to solve some of these tough algorithmic questions. I&#x27;m feeling stuck and I don&#x27;t know how to get out, because I just feel overwhelmed. I want to do something interesting and hopefully make more money, but I&#x27;ve hit a wall. Help!",
