But that&#x27;s not a real sector. The Blockchain itself not a platform, it&#x27;s a tool.( Ditto AI).<p>What will exist will be cloud storage&#x2F;database companies specializing in using the Blockchain in specific existing categories: Fintech (global remittance), Permanent digital archiving etc. It&#x27;s like how Telegram isn&#x27;t a &quot;Mobile Apps&quot; company, it&#x27;s an information transfer (aka communication) company which competes with SMS, newspapers, physical human going to a place to deliver the message by word of mouth etc.<p>So yeah, what are examples of this happening in the past? &quot;New software&quot; at first births &quot;new software&quot; companies in the &quot;new software&quot; sector, until, eventually, &quot;new software&quot; becomes just a normal tool, not with its own companies in its own sector, but which enables companies in existing sectors.",
