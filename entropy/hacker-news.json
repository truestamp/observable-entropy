      "text": "Hello,<p>As I’m developing my products (the latest one being BotMeNot - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;botmenot.com&#x2F; ), I often wonder - do people actually mind data being scraped from their websites?<p>On the one hand, it’s publicly available information - meaning it’s up for grabs for any visitor. I’ve even read some people saying that if you don’t want information being collected from your website - don’t put it on the website in the first place. Do you agree or is this too harsh of a stance in your opinion?<p>On the other hand, it’s a very automated process of information gathering. Web scrapers are far more efficient than humans can ever hope to be. Does this make a difference to you?<p>Also, even if you’re not a website owner, please share your opinion!",
