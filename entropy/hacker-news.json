I created a little tool that allows you to create experiments and insert a code snippet into your code and it automatically measures relevant data that is easily visualized for you. You can check it out here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchapp.co&#x2F;<p>Looking for partners on marketing this product. Also, I will appreciate some feedback. Thank you.",
