There are no apps on it other than stock.<p>For example, I want to download an app to use: `This version of iOS is unsupported`...ok, I&#x27;ll just go to the website.<p>OAuth won&#x27;t work with google on safari because  `Couldn&#x27;t sign you in, this browser or app may not be secure`<p>OK, let&#x27;s update iOS...nope, can&#x27;t be done<p>I&#x27;ve used a mac every day for the past 15 years but have almost never used an iPad, am I a luddite or is Apple really doing their darndest to get me to buy a new iPad?<p>How is this acceptable?",
