Even assuming Google retains a good bit of market share, it’s an open question to what extent they’ll be able to get the same amount of ad revenue, it seems more likely that search will be commoditized (commoditize your complement).

      "text": "I am CEO and co-founder of an profitable Australian startup. We&#x27;ve grown 100% organically without outside investment, which has positives (founders still have 100% control&#x2F;ownership) and negatives (lack of investment has meant slow-ish growth and limited new ideas&#x2F;support). Because of this we have generally targeted safe recurring revenue from the public sector.<p>We&#x27;ve done relatively well putting ourselves into our market and have won out over some bigger incumbents, but sales requires a certain outgoing mindset that no-one in our team currently possesses.<p>We&#x27;re at a point where we have enough technical and product staff to easily support 20-50 times more clients and have a full pipeline and excess captial to invest in finally building a proper sales team to meet our potential.<p>The question I&#x27;m stuck with is how to we find, interview, hire and retain our first sales&#x2F;business development staff.<p>How have other technical founders interviewed for sales, and what are the right kinds of questions to ask? Is salary + commission enough, or should we expect to start having to give away equity as well? Where is the right place to advertise for sales, and are there any good resources to pull from?",
