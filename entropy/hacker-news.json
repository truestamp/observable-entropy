      "text": "I&#x27;m creating a B2B web-based SAAS for small to medium businesses. It&#x27;s going to be a heavy SPA with .Net Core micro-services. I&#x27;ve always been a .Net&#x2F;C# guy and I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the new Blazor webassembly SPA framework. After some heavy testing it&#x27;s 100% capable as a front-end tech. However I worry that there might not be enough of a C# talent-pool willing to be a co-founder or early employee. It seems like 99% of startups these days use one of the Javascript frameworks. It&#x27;s a bummer for me, but should I consider switching my dream stack to Typescript and React or some other framework? Typescript at least has made JS a little more palatable to me.",
