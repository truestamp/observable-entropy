Now that we&#x27;re a remote first company, we want to know if there are engineers who are at a point in their career where they no longer want to work full time, but are still interested in working reduced hours or part time. Specifically, we&#x27;re not so much looking for contractors&#x2F;freelancers to work on specific projects, but for an experienced senior engineer (previously worked for different start ups, or at a larger top tech company) to join a team and essentially be a guru or advisor to the team.<p>What are peoples thoughts on this idea? Is this type of thing something that you&#x27;ve seen at other companies, or would be of interest to see at a company?",
