      "text": "I have spent at least 10000k hours watching youtube, unfortunately. I have noticed that most videos have clickbait title, even more clickbait splashscreen (a picture we are clicking to) and advertisment on the description. Only the comment section sheds a light on the subject without watching. So, is this possible to load a comment section only but not to load a video at all? If the video is really interesting, sometimes (almost always) it is better to send the link to youtube-dl for watching the video later.<p>For example, my hobby is welding and I want to get playing some welding playlist in my garage while I am welding, instead of some music. But I do not want to chose what welding video to watch because I am already doing some welding and do not want to distract from metals to computer. That welding videos are needed for me not because I can not weld but because there might be some useful ideas hidden in those tons of speaking. Autoplay is not an option for me because there is a difference between selected videos and proposed.",
