      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m an engineer building a product in the health insurance space that in theory will allow more accurate pricing of premiums based off of individual data from wearables. My question is why haven&#x27;t health insurance companies built this already? It seems like many companies already went in this direction with their 10,000 step program, but they stoped right there. Why not go further?<p>Does anyone know of prior attempts? Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve Oscar attempting to do something like &quot;hey, runners get X% discount&quot; and so lots of runners sign up who also happen to be at risk of some kind of cancer and then they got blown up by the tails. Anyone else heard similar things? Thanks!",
