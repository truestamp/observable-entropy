      "text": "Notifications have become such a nuisance that end-user devices have started inventing their own ways of providing a premium user experience. What happened to these apps? Did marketing take over and SPAM Gun everyone? What happens to the important transactional notifications that are filtered?<p>This is going to be an interesting battle moving into the era of GDPR, CCPA, CASL, and other regional CANSPAM acts. We&#x27;ve seen apps like Clubhouse basically disappear because everyone toggled off their notifications after being sent 10+ per day.<p>We see pop-ups making a come back now with web push and in-app. It&#x27;s obvious email is out of control. Most companies still don&#x27;t understand how to use SMS. Send times are so far off that we are receiving messages hours after our appointments and engagements about the event starting.<p>I hope that we can begin to educate and encourage appropriate notification usage by enabling observability, centralization, and recipient history|engagement to give end-users the best possible experience alongside your app. I think this post along with their tech is on the right path.<p>Notifications don&#x27;t have to suck. \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-developers-guide-user-requirements",
