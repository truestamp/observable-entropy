I&#x27;ve tried changing my dns, clearing cache, turning off ipv6 on the router,turning off hardware acceleration, disabling adblocker, forcing h264 and signing out.<p>The time of day doesn&#x27;t seem to matter either. Videos work flawlessly on opera so I can use that but I&#x27;m curious if anyone has had this issue and possible solutions.",
