      "text": " Thrilled to announce that very soon The List Of Vulnerabilities collected from multiple platforms including ( npm, Maven, Go, NuGet, PyPI, RubyGems, crates.io, Packagist, Linux, OSS-Fuzz ) will be live at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vulert.com&#x2F;vuln-list. In short we are making sure that no vulnerability is left unreported and your software&#x2F;service is always protected from unexpected attacks.<p>Who doesn’t know Vulert Yet: Vulert, without any integration, notifies you if a Security Issue is found in any of the open-source software you are relying upon.<p>HOW DOES VULERT PROTECT YOU ?<p>PRIVACY: You don&#x27;t need to share your codebase or integrate anything, all you need to do is to upload the list of open-source software you use.\nIMPROVED SECURITY: Existing solutions check the Current Security of your software. Unlike them we track your application not only for current but also for Future Security Issues.\nECONOMICAL: You don’t need security staff just to keep track of your dependencies, Vulert can do it efficiently and it&#x27;s very economical.\n HOW DOES VULERT WORK ?<p>We keep an eye on open source code, our security team analyzes changes in the open source software.\nOn an hourly basis, we gather the security advisories of the Vendors &#x2F; Security Researchers.\nIn case we find any security advisory for a software used by our customers, We notify them.\nFeel free to give feedback or ask any query, to contact info@vulert.com",
