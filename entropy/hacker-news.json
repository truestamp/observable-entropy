      "text": "Hi HN,<p>my current setup consists of 2x imac27 retina sitting next to each other. I use Barrier (a software KVM) to switch mouse&#x2F;keyboard between those. It works well for my need and is an inexpensive cheap way to get a 2x 5K monitor setup (total cost: 2100 EUR)<p>I am considering getting a M1 mac mini and use my 2 current imac27 retina as external monitors. My plan is to get a cheap small monitor for the mac mini, then use Barrier to use the imacs as external monitors.<p>Anyone here has gone that route?",
