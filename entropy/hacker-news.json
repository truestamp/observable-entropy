      "text": "I&#x27;ve been reading Scott Galloway&#x27;s recent post on a possible future downturn:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.profgalloway.com&#x2F;down-round&#x2F;<p>His post, focused on startups in a bear market, got me thinking - how can we, as developers, best prepare for a downturn and possible recession? Are there specific sectors that are a safer bet in a recession, or should we simply focus (even) more on employability (gaining experience in multiple tech stacks, etc)? Are there lessons that people learnt from the the Dot-com Bubble and the 2007–2008 Financial Crisis that we need to remind ourselves of? Thanks in advance.",
