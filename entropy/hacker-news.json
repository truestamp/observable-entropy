      "text": "I have a website which does well in Google results. I&#x27;ve been using anonimised Google Analytics but recently thought about removing even that, as what little I&#x27;m interested in can be gathered from server logs.<p>But I’m worried doing so will penalise the website in Google results.<p>My searches led me to direct answers from Google staff that no, they don’t take Google Analytics into account in rankings[1]. However, those answers are a decade old, from a time Google still touted “don’t be evil” as a motto. The Google of 2022 is one I don‘t expect to keep promises from 2010.<p>Are there reliable and&#x2F;or recent sources which elucidate the case either way? Anecdotal reports can also be helpful.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plausible.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;google-analytics-seo",
