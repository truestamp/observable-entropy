      "text": "I&#x27;m an artist and webmaster of a html&#x2F;css based site with two separate &quot;logs&quot;. These logs are currently on wordpress, but are non-dynamic blogs that could be effectively turned into static sites&#x2F;flat file blogs; in fact, I&#x27;d really like the change given wordpress being bloated.<p>And yet, somehow. Despite searching high and low around the gazilions of &quot;flat file CMSs&quot; and &quot;Static Site Generators&quot;, I have not found a single one that remotely caters to artists&#x2F;illustrators who might want to simply post their art on an open-source, local, and truly free site with a RSS feed. No title, optional date label, nothing else around. &quot;Image-centric&quot; rather than text-centric if you will.<p>Command-line SSG&#x27;s like Jekyll are right out; I&#x27;m a professional designer, not a professional coder. I want to click two buttons to upload an image (on my site). Publii with their GUI and .deb package was much closer but bug-ridden as of now (I will retry in the future). Grav&#x27;s installation was way beyond me. etc.<p>On the flip side, if anyone wants a hobby project with tons of potential users, consider this a free idea. :)",
