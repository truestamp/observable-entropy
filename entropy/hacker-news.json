      "text": "The headline is a little click-bait, humor me.<p>I&#x27;m 39, have a PhD in CS from an older university in Cambridge, MA (not MIT).  When there, I never published much, a couple of top-tier publications with collaborators and a ton of mid-tier publications.<p>I spent 7 years as a Post Doc doing research in an area which I didn&#x27;t care about and where there wasn&#x27;t a lot of scope. In this time I graduated 7 students (who have gone on Facebook, Google, etc) and started two companies -- a direct one which I shut down because it was not successful and helped a friend to start his as co-owner but didn&#x27;t put in any intellectual development. I did a lot of contracting and consulting work for a company my PhD external supervisor started that makes a niche MIPS CPU but doing software work at the kernel&#x2F;application layer.<p>3 years ago I joined the company full-time.  I got the job because he knew me and we are friends (I am absolutely convinced I would have failed an interview). The agreement was I&#x27;d do system architecture for hardware.<p>I was in a world I knew very little about. CPUs are complex hardware devices.  While I had done Computer Architecture and am very comfortable with the hardware as seen from a software level, I started spending my time doing more hardware system architecture work.<p>I love this field.  The challenge means it&#x27;s satisfying.  I wish I&#x27;d done a degree in CE instead.<p>Three years on, I&#x27;m having a hard hard time.  The problems are:<p>* I don&#x27;t know enough -- every time we have a meeting or a new project comes up, it&#x27;s like drinking from a firehose.  PCIe, Memory technologies, the internals of ALUs, caching subsystems -- all of it is a field in and of itself. The complexity and runes and domain specific knowledge means I&#x27;m always running behind never able to quite keep up. Even where I have done things before things move fast so keeping up is hard.<p>* I can&#x27;t think fast enough -- I&#x27;m actually known as &quot;recorder&quot; in the organization -- I record all meetings and go back and listen to them, trying to understand, stopping, taking notes, researching so I can actually follow what&#x27;s going on.  This helps but is hard.<p>* I have a different style of working -- company style is to come into a meeting and freestyle, throw up ideas, brainstorm, etc.  I can&#x27;t do that.  I don&#x27;t know enough and can&#x27;t contribute because most times I only know about half of what is going on.  I am able to come up with solutions and designs alone but I am slower because I alone, learn, design and get feedback afterwards.<p>* My instincts are wrong --  My dimensioning, calculations, core design principles often overlook something or are just not right.  It&#x27;s to be so OBVIOUSLY wrong. At least when it&#x27;s pointed out most times I see it immediately.<p>* Don&#x27;t have the detail -- Not understanding the runes or not following through on all the possible side-effects that may happen mean things can never work. I just delayed tape-out because one return value was 2b offset between busses.<p>* Can&#x27;t seem to abstract and think clearly -- I can&#x27;t seem to reason about cause and effect clearly enough.  In software I felt I always had a good working model in my head.  Here it&#x27;s just gaps.<p>I desperately want to get good the art.  I stay because it&#x27;s a challenge but I feel thick.  I&#x27;m wondering whether I&#x27;ll actually become good enough to be comfortable and master this.<p>A part of me wants to quit and go join the platforms division of some company or the other but  I kind of feel I&#x27;m likely to see the same things in software even if I think I&#x27;m better at it.  Ultimately I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m just not clever enough .  I just spent the holiday break reading a 1000 page architectural standard to come into the new year prepared, spent this week in a workshop where I just couldn&#x27;t keep up even with the prep and am deflated and disillusioned.<p>What advice would you give me?",
