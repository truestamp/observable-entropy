      "text": "I finished my math education some 15 years ago, around calculus 1 &#x2F; linear algebra 1. I&#x27;d like to brush it up and learn more advanced concepts, just for pleasure. Ideally something practical, progressing towards mathematical understanding of modern physics (I know it&#x27;s a long road, hence &quot;progressing&quot;). Tensor algebra&#x2F;calculus seem like a fun and approachable goal to reach.<p>Now of course there are tons of great books and video lectures, but they all seem to lack practical exercises. At best they contain a few creative problems&#x2F;puzzles for every chapter. I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s easier &amp; more fun for the authors to explain things than come up with mundane practice sessions, kind of like writing application code is more fun than writing unit tests for it.<p>Meanwhile I really needs equations to solve, and lots of them, I never learned anything merely by reading about it. The ideal approach would be something like: here&#x27;s an algorithm to multiply two numbers, now solve these 100 examples of AxB=?, here are some rules to derive a derivative, use it on those 100 examples of f&#x27;(x)=?. It&#x27;s fine if part of the algorithm involves for example writing a python program to compute things numerically, as long as there is a clear set of inputs and outputs that you can test it on.<p>Any hints for finding such resources?",
