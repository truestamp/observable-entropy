      "text": "I understand that you are afraid of debt, and you want to avoid it at any cost. Credit scores are now very important, and you have to be careful how you direct them. When you want to take a loan, you have to look at the loans you already have on [1stnwm.com](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.1stnwm.com) and see if you can afford more. I would do it if I wanted to get some money quickly or if I needed to pay for something fast. Hopefully, you will be able to afford another loan without messing up your credit card.",

      "text": "Hoping this doesn’t go against any HN guidelines. My apologies in advance if it does.<p>With the holidays coming up I&#x27;ll have some free time on my hands and would like to give back something to this community. I&#x27;ve been working as a frontend developer for almost a decade and I&#x27;ve looked at many resumes in that time. I&#x27;ve seen just about every level of quality in a resume and feel like many could have benefitted from having another developer review it.<p>So, if anyone is interested, I’m inviting you to send your resume to the email in my profile and I’ll try to give you some feedback. I don’t have any particular qualifications in doing this type of thing, so keep in mind that my feedback is subjective and not necessarily good advice. Nonetheless, I think there is still value in knowing the impression your resume makes on another developer and I&#x27;d like to provide that to you!",
