      "text": "Currently a senior appsec engineer (5 years in the field) looking at starting a Masters in Software Engineering at a Arizona State University. Not super excited to go back to school but everyone in my department has both more experience and a grad degree. I’m truly wondering if the program is worth it in terms of proficiency or if the content is just too academic to be practical. Not interested in cybersecurity degrees as the scope is too broad. Not interested in certifications as I have the OSCE3 already and that seems enough.<p>HN, was your grad program worth it? Did it lead to you producing novel&#x2F;original work in your field? Who are these degrees for?",
