      "text": "So say I want to write some software involving a specific domain. Let’s say the particular domain is <i>very</i> math heavy, in particular calculus. The parts of calculus find in upper level undergraduate programs. Now I’ve never been particularly good at math, in part because I didn’t really care about it when I was younger.<p>So basic in order to even get started on this project, I have to be at least somewhat familiar with<p>1) The tools I want to use to write the software \n2) The domain \n3) The prerequisite knowledge required to understand the domain (in the case the upper level math and a few other things.\n4) The prerequisite knowledge for <i>3</i> (which involves more basic calculus, algebra etc. basically the stuff I never paid much attention to in school)<p>My problem is I have to learn that from the bottom up. Now if I was just starting at <i>2</i> or even <i>3</i>, it would be no problem. My problem is at the fourth level.<p>At this point, I know the resources to use, but I find it extremely difficult to even get started, as it involves grinding through hours of videos, books, etc. to reviews &#x2F; learn &#x2F; relearn stuff that’s so abstracted and far away from my original goal that I just can’t keep the motivation. It adds significant time cost and removes the lesrning benefit that comes with a concrete, interest and is basically a return to everything I disliked about math when I was younger.<p>Does anyone have any advice on how one could motivate themselves through something like this?",

      "text": "I&#x27;d like to start a consultancy focused on automating &#x2F; streamlining operational inefficiencies in small&#x2F;med sized businesses. I&#x27;ve learned through the years at various jobs that I&#x27;m good at automating these type of things, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t use those as part of my portfolio since the projects are not able to be discussed publicly.<p>What I&#x27;m offering:<p>Do you have a process in your business that requires a lot of manual back-and-forth between humans? For example - when an order is created, I have to update a spread sheet, reach out to my vendor, submit the order, buy a postage label, and send the customer an email update with the tracking information. Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for processes that depend upon the coordination of multiple people working on a repetitive process. Anything from order fulfillment, landlord maintenance requests, to customer onboarding processes.<p>I&#x27;m not charging anything. This is just me putting in the work to build up a portfolio of examples I can use for my consultancy. If we do launch an automated version of your process, I may just ask that you pay for the hosting costs (like $10-$20 max) per month.",
