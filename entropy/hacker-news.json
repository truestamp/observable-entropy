      "text": "I just wanted to share my short cautionary tale about DO.<p>I am running an application on managed Kubernetes. From a tech perspective, I was quite happy until this happened.<p>I broke my production system by introducing a bug in the k8s infrastructure. So I went over to DO to login and fix it. \nSince it uses 2FA, it sends a 6 digit code to my email for me to enter in order to login. The only problem is, that the email never arrives in my Gmail inbox.<p>I made double and triple sure it&#x27;s not in spam, and checked that emails arrive normally in my inbox. But it&#x27;s just not there. I guess there is a bug on DO&#x27;s side.<p>So I open a ticket, as this is already quite urgent (production is down). But I get no answer. I waited a few hours and opened another ticket. With no success. \nBy now it&#x27;s be 24h, and I cannot get a hold of anybody at DO.<p>I guess I got what I paid for. Digital Ocean is nice for playing around, but for serious projects one should look elsewhere.",
