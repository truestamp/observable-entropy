Since there is a ton of information there, which I can export as kml files, however, I don&#x27;t want to do the manual work of creating the visualization since there must be a tool that already does that.<p>Either-ways, ping me if you&#x27;re interested in hashing out a good solution for this, I have a couple of ideas I want to soundboard.",
