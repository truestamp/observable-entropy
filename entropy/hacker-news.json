      "text": "Just tried to login to chase.com using a fresh Firefox install. Normally it gives options for email or SMS for 2FA verification. Since SMS is insecure, I&#x27;ve always used email. That option is now missing. Since SMS was the only option left, I tried that, but it doesn&#x27;t work with my Google Voice number.<p>According to customer support, email verification was removed for everyone and they&#x27;ve been getting lots of calls about it. Also according to them carriers often block SMS short codes, which makes SMS more error-prone than email.<p>Anyone know anyone on at Chase engineering? I would love to hear the rationale for removing something as universal as email while leaving insecure SMS as an option.",
