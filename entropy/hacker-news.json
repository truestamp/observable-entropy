      "text": "Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a research engineer at a startup doing mostly machine learning for science &amp; engineering applications. I joined right after my PhD in a natural science. I&#x27;m not keen on moving around for postdoc positions so this seemed like a good option.<p>I am satisfied with the work but I&#x27;m an idealist and my long-term dream is still a faculty position at a university.<p>1. Did I throw a wrench into that by choosing an industry gig over a postdoc? \n2. Are there any (recent) examples of research engineers transitioning into a tenured position? \n3. What should I optimize for in my current position to better my odds of achieving that?<p>(I&#x27;m EU based &amp; working for a US company in case it matters.)",
