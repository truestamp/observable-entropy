Just upload the folder to your webspace (minimal PHP requirements!) and you are good to go.<p>Create some collections for you data, link them if needed, and you can immediately use them via the API endpoints AND also via a GUI for CRUD operations.<p>This is really great because my colleagues are non-technical and I don&#x27;t need to write some frontend for them to update data and so on and can concentrate on the &quot;real task&quot;.<p>Documentation on the other hand is awful, to the point where you better refer to the &quot;inofficial documentation&quot; (for the interested: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zeraton.gitlab.io&#x2F;cockpit-docs&#x2F;) with no way to improve the official one.<p>So, while I LOVE the ease of use, I wondered if somebody has a recommendation for a similar solution which might be somewhat more &quot;mature&quot; in regards to the documentation.",
