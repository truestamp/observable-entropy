It gave three options to fix this: &quot;manipulee&quot;, &quot;maniple&quot;, and &quot;manipulees&quot;. But if you just try to google &quot;manipuble&quot;, it will inform you that it&#x27;s instead searching for &quot;manipulable&quot;. I can&#x27;t think of a single time when searching for a misspelled word didn&#x27;t yield the correct spelling as the first suggested result, but it&#x27;s almost a daily occurrence for chromes typo suggestions to avoid suggesting the correct, seemingly nearby, word. This feels like a newish occurrence too, I don&#x27;t remember ever having this much issue with it years ago.",
