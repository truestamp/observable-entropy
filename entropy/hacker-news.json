      "text": "Hello everyone, I&#x27;ve been working on Engagespot, an API that helps you build your product&#x27;s transactional notification engine in minutes -<p>Engagespot lets you -<p>* Send multi-channel transactional notifications to your users from your product through providers like FCM, Sendgrid, Mailgun etc\n* Quickly add a Notification Preference&#x2F;Settings feature to your app.\n* Add a ready-to-use Notification UI-Kit &#x2F; component to your React Apps.\n* View detailed logs on notification delivery across channels.<p>## The Story<p>Having worked with different product development teams, I&#x27;ve always noticed the challenges faced by developers in building transactional notifications. It&#x27;s easy to start building, but soon we&#x27;ll face challenges like -<p>* Routing notification through different channels such as email&#x2F;push&#x2F;SMS. \n* Integrating service providers like Sendgrid, FCM.\n* Tracking notification read&#x2F;click events. \n* Building an In-App notification inbox component.\n* Notification actions.\n* Avoiding duplicates, Handling multiple devices\n* Giving users the ability to set their notification preferences.\n* Debug delivery issues, etc.<p>All these began to eat developer hours soon.<p>But we cannot ignore notifications. It is an integral part of a product, especially if it has multi-user interactions. For example, task management apps, social networks, CRM, etc. Messages like - &quot;User ABC commented on your photo&quot;, &quot;Someone assigned you a task&quot; etc are critical for user engagement. Without such timely alerts, users may miss the purpose of using such apps altogether.<p>With Engagespot, you can get started with a beautiful, fully customizable Notification Inbox component (for React&#x2F;Javascript apps), an API-first multi-channel notification routing&#x2F;delivery infrastructure, and an inbuilt notification preference manager engine for your users. This can save you months of coding work. The idea behind Engagespot is that - &quot;Let us handle notifications while you build your product&quot;<p>The next time when you want to write code to build notifications, please try our product :) Also, if you have built transactional notification systems from scratch, please share your story.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engagespot.co\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.engagespot.co",
