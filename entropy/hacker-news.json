This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.<p>I&#x27;ve seen several submissions by HNers working on &#x27;friendlier&#x27; social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.<p>This seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I&#x27;ve tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.",
