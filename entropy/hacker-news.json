When there is an error in operation, I want the device to be able to ring an audible tone on my mobile phone (a ring or a beep). Is there a cooked solution to be able to do this with least effort (or no code).<p>Another option is to play a sound on some rasp4 at my office. This raspi may expose an api endpoint which the troubled device in field can call.<p>Any suggestion&#x2F;feedback&#x2F;criticism is welcome.",
