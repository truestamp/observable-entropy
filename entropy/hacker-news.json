      "text": "Hi All - I&#x27;m Eric, and I’ve been working on a math-tutoring application that continually adapts to a child’s learning needs as they answer questions: www.grokkoli.com&#x2F;beta (introduces new concepts in granular steps, figures out where&#x2F;how learners might be confused &amp; attempts to resolve it, speeds kids past the stuff they understand clearly, tracks their recall, answer-speed, and more).<p>Currently in beta, looking for families with kids in grades 1-6 to beta-test.<p>Especially interested in taking on families that are finding math to be a challenge.<p>Happy to share more details if needed (still assessing the level of detail most considerate&#x2F;appropriate on HN).<p>All feedback is welcome.",
