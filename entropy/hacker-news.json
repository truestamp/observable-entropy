      "text": "I&#x27;ve managed a data science team now for about a year and I&#x27;m looking to explore new opportunities. My first step is to update my resume but I am struggling with how to talk about what I do as a leader. My first draft has a lot of &quot;led this project&quot;, &quot;orchestrated that effort&quot;, &quot;managed this system&quot;. I do not think my resume is coming off as being detailed. How should I be talking about projects that I am in charge of, but I am not the one doing the day to day work on?<p>For any given project, I meet with the business stakeholder and strategize on the goal and solution. I break the project out into milestones. Then I hand those off to an IC on my team. I give feedback on their implementation. I help them with code issues as they come up. I regularly meet with our partners and give status updates and timelines. I help the IC refine presentation materials. Finally I coordinate with other teams to get the solution put in a production environment.<p>Im struggling with how to write a resume that makes me look like a good management candidate and I&#x27;d appreciate any advice.<p>Thank you",
