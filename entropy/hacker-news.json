      "text": "Hey.<p>Long story short, I think something went wrong in my LinkedIn profile was temporarily restricted ( I don&#x27;t think I did anything unusual, but who knows what happened ). MS wants me to submit my ID, which I won&#x27;t do for several different reasons, but it is not why I am here. I am seeing it as an opportunity. Yeah, that profile was substantial and so on, but why can&#x27;t I recreate it as my own space&#x2F;website? It is mostly there to for HR&#x2F;recruiters anyway..<p>I guess the question is. How do you guys do it ( show off your online presence )? Simple website? Blog? Github?<p>Thank you in advance,",
