However, the &quot;business side&quot; of the company needs convincing because they are focused on short-term goals.<p>With that in mind, I&#x27;m trying to better understand my audience&#x27;s language and thought processes and was wondering if y&#x27;all knew of resources that talked about similar problems formally.<p>(If it helps I&#x27;ve mostly been on the science&#x2F;engineering side of businesses for nearly a decade so this is really my first exposure to needing to convince the &quot;business side&quot; in a formal manner with their own language)<p>(Also, if it helps, this open source technology seems to have a massive hype machine behind it; it&#x27;s not hard to find engineers&#x2F;scientists having very serious problems with it but it is masked by how a certain search engine is pushing tons of flattering articles to the front of the search)",
