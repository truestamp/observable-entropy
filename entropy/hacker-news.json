      "text": "hello<p>I prepared modular monolith Java application with DDD. In the plans, this application should be easily rewritten as microservices.<p>The goals of this application:\n- example of modular monolith with DDD;\n- example of communications between bounded contexts;\n- example of simple CQRS implementation;\n- example of documentation of architecture decisions;\n- focus on quality of technical solutions;<p>More details about the architecture and decisions can be found in project description. It will be great to get feedback, code review and comments. I&#x27;m going to improve the implementation after getting the feedback. Any help&#x2F;review&#x2F;comments are welcome.<p>The application is in development status. Please feel free to submit pull request or create the issue.\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anton-liauchuk&#x2F;educational-platform",
