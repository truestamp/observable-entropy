Spotify does show stats with top cities, but only for artist logged in, not for anyone requested. If I crawl this info from an artist&#x27;s page, for every my user registered, then I first need everyone registered, which is problematic.<p>So, dear HN, maybe I&#x27;m missing some obvious way so work around that?\nOr, maybe there are readily available data for me to purchase?\nOr, should I just beg Spotify to add an api to do that?",
