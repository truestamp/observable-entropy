      "text": "We need a better robots.txt standard  … that tech companies (and bot writers) should be required to adhere to; Here&#x27;s my simple suggestion;<p>Stopping a huge amount of bad bot behaviour surely could be a really simple thing to do? .. I believe it is, and here’s how …<p>* Bots should have to start a session by requesting robots.txt before any interaction with a website;\nthat robots file should optionally include a correlationID &#x2F; sessionID for the duration of any bot scraping, so that subsequent requests arriving from new IP addresses can be correlated back to the same bot session.<p>This would dramatically assist in identifying good vs bad &quot;bot&quot; behaviour. Especially considering that &quot;good&quot; &#x2F;polite bot behaviour, by definition is hard to monitor, since requests may come in a few seconds apart from each other, and paused and resumed over time to deliberately avoid swamping&#x2F;over working servers.<p>The result is that really good bots ... are hard to tag as Good bots.<p>* All bots shouid also have a standardised API ( which should be advertised in their request headers ) where you can make a callback to the API on a well known branded domain relating to the search engine&#x2F;bot &#x2F; service, where you can submit a token GUID that the bot can be required to present during all future crawls.<p>...since crawls would be done over https, this would be a simple enough mechanism to easily identify bot impersonators without requiring the bots to be limited to making requests from a known DNS domain.<p>... with a token becoming effective within a reasonable period of say 3 to 5 minutes. i.e. enough time for any distributed cache to be updatable and any bot running an existing crawl should not start a crawl session lasting longer than the same period, or if it does should check the token-is-required cache within a period no longer than the same 3 to 5 minutes. whatever is deemed pratical at today&#x27;s cloud scale.<p>What do you think?<p>p.s. my thoughts are based on my experience of code I&#x27;ve written for running on the cheap, on edge computing “CloudFlare workers”; which presents an interesting challenge of how to do this without access to distributed caching etc. (yes they do exist at edge, but can&#x27;t be used without increasing latency or costs being worse than the traffic you’re trying to block. So it&#x27;s just about what can easily be done on the cheap;  to block say 80% of bad traffic for like 1% of effort) My code doesn’t have to be perfect, just effective.",
