      "text": "A common mistake I see more and more people do is to build websites using React and Vue.js.\nThese frameworks are meant to build web apps, they provide no advantage if you want to build a content website, worse they will kill all your SEO efforts.\nHaving done a lot of SEO research in the past year, I came to the conclusion that search engines heavily penalize React and Vue.js websites even when they use server side rendering and I think they do this rightfully.<p>If I am looking for some kind of information, I want to have it right away, with spending as little bandwidth as possible and certainly I don&#x27;t want to start a web app with over 1mb of javascript.<p>To summarize:<p>- Where React or Vue.js are a good choice:\nWeb Apps that you don&#x27;t want to be indexed by search engines. Such as SaaS tools or administration interfaces.<p>- Where you shouldn&#x27;t use React or Vue.js:\nContent websites with little dynamic functionalities that you want to be indexed on search engines.",
