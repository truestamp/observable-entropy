      "text": "Everyday, I have to deal with Bash scripts and all the code duplication and unreadableness that comes with it. One day I found myself implementing an include function so that I could easily modularize my scripts, and it worked better than I had anticipated. That&#x27;s how toolbox started.<p>At first, I wrote some simple modules for command line parsing and locking, but then I tried to see how far I could push the poor shell. I wrote modules for semaphores and &quot;thread&quot;-safe queues, and this is where things quickly started to escalate. To implement a distributed build system that automates packaging&#x2F;signing&#x2F;publishing of toolbox Debian packages, I wrote a module for message-based IPC that supports point-to-point and pub-sub communication. Performance was never a consideration, but it works really well without consuming excessive resources.<p>Some of the modules are arguably serious abuse of the shell, but I found that toolbox makes it possible to write Bash scripts that are readable, testable, and reliable. Shell isn&#x27;t a terribly nice language, but it&#x27;s great for integrating and automating things, so I thought others might find this useful, too.<p>(I am going to publish the build system as well, as soon as I am done writing the documentation.)",
