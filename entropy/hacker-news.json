      "text": "I’ve been a member of this site since 2016.  I’ve always been fascinated with technology, computers, and coding, since I was a kid.  I grew up and live in Los Angeles, playing classical piano, songwriting, composing, and majored in music business. I’ve managed a construction company, and I’ve been running my recording studio for the last 15+ years since graduating from college.  I’ve produced numerous major label hip-hop artists from the Wu-Tang Clan, to Rick Ross, to Nas.  I’ve finally reached a crossroad.  The industry isn’t as stable as it once was, and I’m looking to transition my career. \nI’m 37M, newly married with no kids (yet) and ready for some change.  I’ve read HN daily for the last 5 years and I’m looking for advice as I’ve read so many articles here and comments upon comments of yours that have encouraged me to take the leap.  Throughout my professional music career, and since I was a kid learning piano, I always built my own PCs, set up Linux servers for fun, coded websites and tinkered away.  The joy has always been there. I’ve finally decided to ask you all here at HN what path I should take if you were in my shoes.  Currently I’ve been looking at Google Certifications (UX&#x2F;UI, Data Analyst, Project Manager) Is that a route that would be suggested, or perhaps a different one?  I hope this post isn’t too long, and I’m an open book.  I really appreciate any advice here as I am looking to reach the next phase of growth, development, and challenges in my life.  I’m capable, determined, and very excited about this.  \nThank you to each and every one of you.",
