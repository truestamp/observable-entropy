      "text": "Hi, I just discovered what steno is and it seems really cool. Right now I am just blown away by how fast some stenographers can type. I am thinking of buying a Uni v3 but wondering if the amount of effort it’ll take to learn steno will be worth it. Does anyone here use steno for programming or just writing in general? If you do, do you have any tips on how to learn stenography faster? Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "I&#x27;m not a security expert but I always thought that HTTPS was secure and that if my code was calling an API (for example) with HTTPS&#x2F;SSL Cert that it was encrypted end to end. Rephrase, I know it&#x27;s encrypted but I&#x27;m aware that MIM or SSL Proxy methods can be used to expose that traffic by spoofing client&#x2F;server keys.<p>So I assume that someone has to be on your network to use a tool like Charles Proxy. Is the combination of securing your network plus HTTPS \n&quot;enough&quot; security to keep web and app traffic safe? What are other aspects I&#x27;m missing? Would love to learn more if anyone is willing to share some good resources. TIA.",
