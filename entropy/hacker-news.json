      "text": "To be more accurate, I am referring to the Go programming language, but I assume the answer doesn&#x27;t depend heavily on a particular language.<p>Not so long ago, I switched to Go from Python and I really appreciate almost all aspects of the language. I have read all the recommended resources (and keep rereading some of them like Effective Go). At this stage, very often it all boils down to reading the specification, which is very readable and user-friendly.<p>Nonetheless, there are some questions for which explanations unexpectedly (for me, I mean) shift the discussion to code in C, assembly instructions, how the compiler is implemented.<p>Even though I understand that pretty often it&#x27;s not necessary to understand things at a very low level, but I feel comfortable when unable to do so.<p>What are some resources or at least subjects I should get comfortable with so I can reason about more advanced issues like performance, motivation behind certain language decisions, etc.<p>Do you think that getting your feet wet with C is necessary for that? Compilers? Assembly? Something else?",
