      "text": "Google and Facebook use mercurial as their preferred VCS and one thing I noticed when I left and switched to git (and friends have noticed this as well) is that git sucks.<p>The biggest issue I personally have with git is its poor ability to handle chained and rebased commits. Since this isn&#x27;t a problem with mercurial, I used to able to create several small PRs and chain them together, make edits anywhere in the chain and propagate them down chain in an instant. The second you squash a PR with git, be ready to spend the next 15+ min dealing with merge conflicts rebasing several PRs. This has pretty much lead me either creating larger PRs or switching contexts - which slow everyone down.<p>I&#x27;d love to go back to using mercurial - where is the best place to host a mercurial repository with tooling similar to&#x2F;on par with Github?",
