      "text": "I have an old laptop loaded with an offline copy of Wikipedia (Kiwix). It has no networking whatsoever and hasn&#x27;t seen an USB device for more than a year. I use it daily to read as I would a physical encyclopedia and I take some notes on it that never leave (or so I guessed).<p>I also have a Pixel phone and accounts on all major social media. So I have noticed recently that after reading on that laptop about cookies, I get ads of cookie brands. Cats lead to cat food ads. Vitamins lead to supplement ads. Companies and businesses lead to job offer ads from the respective ones. It is very blatant and immediate.<p>Is data leaking from that system to advertisers? How?",
