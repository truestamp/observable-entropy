However there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any change in the real estate market around coastal areas, in fact waterfront houses seem to be more valuable than ever.<p>Why is this? Greed? Ignorance?<p>The tin-foil-hat part of me thinks that financial firms wouldn&#x27;t buy&#x2F;lend and build coastal developments unless they had evidence it would be a wise investment...",

      "text": "Hey guys,<p>Genuine question here. How does remittance through crypto work? Presumably, you&#x27;d need an offramp in the destination country.<p>Here is the problem though:<p>if you&#x27;re constantly exchanging crypto for local fiat in that destination country, at some point you&#x27;d run out of local fiat and you&#x27;d have a bunch of crypto on your hands, so you&#x27;d need to trade it back.<p>How do crypto remittance companies handle this problem legally?<p>1) work with illegal&#x2F;unlicensed crypto brokers?<p>2) work with big exchanges like binance? but then you&#x27;d have to wait for the fiat to arrive via arrive, at which point why not just use wire instead of crypto all together?<p>3) work with local crypto exchange that&#x27;s licensed and has a bank in your country? this seem legit, but only works in countris where this exchange exists AND if they want to work with you.<p>This is a genuine question. If you know anything about how any crypto remittancce companies actually work undeer the hood, would love to know?",
