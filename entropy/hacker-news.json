      "text": "I am working on a crypto project using React.JS, just experimenting with web3 and MetaMask wallet.<p>In the project, I was reading my private keys from a json file and last night I accidentally committed this json file to my GitHub private repository. The repository was brand new and I just emailed an invitation to my colleague that we were working together on Zoom. \nAfter realizing that I have committed the private keys, I immediately deleted the whole repository and pushed a whole new repo again.<p>But after 1 hour, I discovered that nothing was left in my wallets and whatever I sent to these wallets is being transferred to another account afterwards.<p>Here is an example of transactions from the last night:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;polygonscan.com&#x2F;address&#x2F;0x7a9eb3cc39bc6ac940febbdb5bb29b8f9ece8a5b<p>All of the sender wallets were mine for the recipient above.<p>What do you  think?",
