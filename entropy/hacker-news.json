      "text": "Hey HN!<p>Before I get into it, I just want to thank you all for the overwhelming responses I&#x27;ve received on my recent Ask HN (the one about my interest in many disciplines [0], I bring this up because it&#x27;s all kinda related).<p>Sorry that this post is going to be long, because it&#x27;s, well, ambitious. More ambitious than anything I&#x27;ve done with my life.<p>In short, I&#x27;m working on something that involves writing a series of long-form critical essays to be published on a website of my own. It&#x27;s going to be a long process, so I&#x27;m hoping to get some feedback on the feasibility of it all.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to keep this a secret for fear of judgement and of &quot;leaking my ideas&quot;, but I&#x27;m starting to think that keeping it so private may be doing more harm than good.<p>I&#x27;m sharing all this here now because I trust HN to give a diverse set of honest and critical feedback, which I really need. I also feel that HN is going to be the audience that will understand my overarching theses the most. I know there will be some people here that will disagree with my points, but that&#x27;s part of the process and I&#x27;m prepared for that.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s a lot to unpack. I&#x27;ll start with my backstory, as for me there really was a interesting narrative that led up to all this.<p>... (due to character limits, I&#x27;ll have to continue in the comments) ...",
