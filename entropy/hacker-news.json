      "text": "Hi,<p>We are a SaaS business having customers all over the world and some of them in India. Recently, with the new Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s (RBI) regulations on online payments, which we use for recurring subscriptions on our SaaS products, we have lost all of our Indian customers. While it&#x27;s a &quot;small&quot; part of our revenue, it feels really weird and sad as we can&#x27;t do much to help them back: currently, Stripe doesn&#x27;t provide any update on their off-session (ie. automatic recurring) payments APIs and don&#x27;t even provide a clear plan so far as to when we could get it back (we are in contact with the support, which told us to wait for it).<p>We had dealt with the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulation in Europe last year and it didn&#x27;t have such a big impact.<p>Have any of you dealt with that? Did you forced Indian users to manual payments each month?<p>I imagine it should be quite a hell for Indian users right now, not being able to use many SaaS products.<p>Have any of you, as a business providing service to Indian users, or as an Indian user, been impacted by this too?",
