But sometimes it happens and in my case at least seems to be very dumb.<p>Some examples:\n- <i>&quot;your code is correct and it does what we asked, but the way we write code is different&quot;</i>\n- <i>&quot;you have the fundamental skills required for the role and have experience in a smaller company, but you don&#x27;t have experience in a large company&quot;</i>\n- <i>&quot;I don&#x27;t think you would be happy in this role, I see you more of a &lt;random_role&gt; instead&quot;</i><p>I almost never get feedback that I didn&#x27;t have the skills. It&#x27;s always some variant of I have them, but &lt;reason&gt;.<p>Any advice?",
