      "text": "Hi everyone. Thanks for reviewing my request. We are launching a new app for freelancers and side hustlers - think dog walking, stonk advice, and all that fun stuff. Take ownership using the skills you already have. We are looking for any feedback (as negative as possible) so we can bring the best product to market. I appreciate in advance any help and support you can provide. If this post isn&#x27;t for you, I apologize in advance. What works and what doesn&#x27;t?  Thank you. Travis  (We are only currently set up for Canada and the US ATM).",
