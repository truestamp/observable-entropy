      "text": "So I was wanting to replace Google Search for a long time due to the poor results filled with ads and content farmed articles.<p>I signed up for the Kagi Search beta (kagi.com) and finally received my invite this week.<p>So far, all the searches that I have tried, I have gotten better results than Google.<p>DuckDuckGo was something I sometimes used but I would often have to !g a lot of things or feel like I might be missing out on better results. So that would make me also Google search those things.<p>With Kagi I have not found that till now. In fact the results have been so good that I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to also search Google for very important queries.<p>Amazingly my go to query to test search engines has been &quot;frozen record&quot; without the quotes which I want to point to: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;byroot&#x2F;frozen_record.<p>It is a query which almost every other search engine doesn&#x27;t quite get since it contains two common words but surprisingly kagi gets it and places the result at number 2 which is huge.<p>I know a lot of people here have been clamouring for a different search so I thought this might be useful. No relations with Kagi.",
