It relates to a huge number of people.<p>I&#x27;ve even seen red&#x2F;green color coding in healthcare-related websites (my deficiency is so mild that it&#x27;s almost never an issue, but it&#x27;s still something that I find strange - they should be aware of it, if anyone). There are palettes that are designed to be compatible with everyone (except those rare cases with black-and-white vision, and full blindness).<p>And I&#x27;ve never felt that this is something that I can be open about with colleagues, in a way that is equal to how women can be open about their issues. For example, what if a workplace bully uses this weakness as a way to question my ability to do my work? It shouldn&#x27;t be like this.",
