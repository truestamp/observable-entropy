Unreal allows you to select Actors (the objects in the game), but if you optimize to display a lot of items (Instanced Static Meshes), it doesn&#x27;t easily allow you to select a subset with a rectangle. This weekend, I am determined to find a way to select a subset of these Instance Static Meshes.",

      "text": "I’ve been a React dev for several years and used to enjoy it more, but recently I’ve gotten more frustrated by how time-consuming the styling is. It feels like most of my time is spent messing with CSS and divs.<p>I just recently learned SwiftUI for a side project and it’s been a breath of fresh air. I love the simplicity of the different Stack types and how the modifiers can chain together. I love how the layout engine works and how intuitive it is to determine how to space things out. It feels so easy to read, write, and take a design from blank space to completion.<p>I’m wondering if there are any libraries in React-land that are similar. I’ve come across Chakra, which looks somewhat close, but a glance at some examples make it look a bit more complex. Has anyone either used Chakra and can comment on it or used other React&#x2F;component libraries that bring SwiftUI layout concepts to the web?",
