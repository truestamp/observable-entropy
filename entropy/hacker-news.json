Thumb keyboard off-by-one errors.<p>2. Bad auto-correct.<p>3. Automatic speech recognition gone wrong.<p>4. Combined with: On a tiny screen, it&#x27;s harder in general to detect input errors, especially in long strings &#x2F; paragraphs of entered text.<p>I&#x27;m asking because I find myself browsing HN more and more from my phone during the pandemic, and find that more of these errors slide past me compared to what I typically expect of myself.<p>And then I was thinking, if more people posting from mobile, where it&#x27;s quite difficult not to let these small errors through at as good of a rate compared to a proper desktop or notebook computer scenario.",
