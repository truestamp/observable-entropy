      "text": "I&#x27;ve tried to learn programming through many MOOCs but failed multiple times.<p>Are there any good resources that are interesting to learn? \nThe problem I face is most of these MOOCs are too boring in the beginning and I usually end up abandoning them.<p>Lately, I came across Project Euler and I&#x27;m having fun solving the challenges on the platform. I&#x27;m planning to learn Python as I like to pivot my career towards the data side and may create some generative art in the future!<p>Some help would be appreciated!<p>To give some context, I work as a Product Engineer developing digital solutions for an energy company. I don&#x27;t code, but I understand the whole software development process at a high level. I currently act as a bridge between the development team and the management.<p>My expertise in programming is limited to the following:\n- I&#x27;ve fairly a good grasp of HTML, something I learned by editing websites.\n- I know a bit of SQL to query data\n- I have some experience in Arduino programming and know how to code basic stuff\n- I learnt C while in college and understand the basics of loops, conditional statements, etc.",
