      "text": "Apple is currently blowing all the Windows laptops out of this world. I&#x27;m currently M1 Macbook Air owner, but I&#x27;ve always been a Windows user my whole life and I really miss my muscle memory and other stuff that Windows offers.<p>The thing is, going back to a Windows laptop after  my M1 Macbook Air is like a night and day, Windows laptops are just terrible in comparison. I own two Thinkpads: T590 (work provided) and T480s (personal before MBA) and their screens suck (16:9 as well), trackpads are terrible, fans are obnoxious and they get warm.<p>But I can&#x27;t get used to Mac OS and I want Windows back, any recommendations?<p>My main concerns are:<p>- Screen, atleast bright, but 16:10 would be lovely<p>- Does not get hot or too loud when doing normal tasks",
