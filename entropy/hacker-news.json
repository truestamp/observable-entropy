      "text": "I recently talked a bit with an independent service provider and she mentioned the high rate of people who simply dont show up. Forcing her to overbook from time to time and deal with the bad feedback of people who show up double booked.<p>Are there any services for this? I would think something like making a down payment you get back (QR code the service provider scans?) if you show up minus a processing fee. However the kind of people who pull stuff like this are also likely to exploit payment services to get their deposit back. So doing this on credit cards would be a nightmare. Is this the reason it doesnt exist? Or are there services like this?",
