      "text": "It&#x27;s been a while since I have felt that Google&#x27;s results have deteriorated. It takes a lot of tricks to find what I am looking for. Today an interesting case occurred that frustrated me a lot and is worth telling HN.<p>First, I was looking for a song and searched for: &quot;here were the dreams are born&quot; (I know I mistyped). One of the first results I found was this interesting story (Google results https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;gUq4XVZ):<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mechahuggermr.tripod.com&#x2F;id66.html<p>I took the following sentence from this story and used it in the readme of an internal project:<p>&quot;David, we have been expecting you - this is what you have been searching for - this place, David, is where dreams are born&quot;<p>Some people wanted to know where this quote came from and could not find it on Google.<p>I also tested and cannot enter any combination of parameters into Google to find this page. I tried quotation marks, literal search and no hyphen. Nothing, it is impossible to find it.<p>Does anyone know what is going on here? Can someone do a magic call and find this page on Google?<p>Has Google&#x27;s AI&#x2F;BERT Enhanced Search reached a point where indexed pages can not be found?<p>All results were tested with a Brazilian connection and replicated in a Private Session on an US VPN.",
