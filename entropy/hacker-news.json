      "text": "In our case where I&#x27;m supporting a multitenant k8s environment for large company... Where each tenant is different team who are hosting web apps for their business units. We have traditionally abstracted logging monitoring as a service to our tennants so they didn&#x27;t have to implement these cross cutting concerns. Now with authentication we would have done your traditional SSO (Oam, siteminder, ping) as centrallized on platform layer....<p>But as we are seeing more and more apps implement their own openidc in their own web frameworks... The tradition http header based remote_user approach is looked down upon.<p>But as a platform I see everyone again reinventing the wheel... And these are digression from app logic...  Also I noticed there are few open-source openidc proxy or an claim based authorization solution..<p>But I wonder if it still makes sense to have SSO&#x2F;Authn layer at platform anymore or it&#x27;s more modern (better design) to let apps do it on their own?",
