I hit them all the time unintentionally.<p>Maybe hacker news could throw an @media section in the CSS and make the links large enough to avoid accidental taps on mobile?<p>I have the same development philosphy as HN, roughly doing a minimal implementation that is close to what the machine requires. But I also value an interface that humans can use. I think with a couple lines of code HN could make this more usable without corrupting the spirit of a no-frills website.",
