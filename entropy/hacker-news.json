      "text": "https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23248137 (not my post)<p>More of my opinion on &quot;free software support&quot; by large corporations... (don&#x27;t be fooled).<p>I consulted for a child education company. They used games for teaching, games written in Adobe Flash. But their goal was to move to the iPad, one per child. To understand their technology I wrote a new game in Flash. Unfortunately, Apple&#x27;s newest iPad would not support Flash. Then Adobe killed Flash. So I re-wrote the game in Objective-C. But Apple moved to Swift so I re-wrote the game in Swift. I tried to distribute it for the company but it required an Apple developer license and a &quot;lock in&quot; to the Apple Store, which conflicted with their company goals. The company, and their hundred child educational games, died.<p>The idea of &quot;The Store&quot; and vendor lock-in has become the new battleground. I saw, but have not followed so I may be wrong, the Apple-Facebook fight about &quot;The Store&quot;. Apparently Apple wants 30% of revenue, including in-game purchase revenue, just for hosting games. I don&#x27;t game, I don&#x27;t use facebook, and I now avoid the Apple ecosystem as much as possible so this is a &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; (so far). But it does show that &quot;The Store&quot; is the latest battleground technique.<p>Part 1 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30269511) was the Microsoft motion to lock-in github developers, now requiring a Microsoft acccount. So I stopped using github.<p>&quot;The Store&quot; wars have taken another major step, this time on Microsoft&#x27;s part.<p>I develop on Linux. One of my machines has Windows 10. I use WSL2 and X11 for some portable development work. I want to make sure my free software can run everywhere. I got caught up in &quot;Embrace&quot;.<p>I bought a new Dell laptop last week. It runs Windows 10 S (W10S). I failed to do my homework on this purchase. New laptops are the latest victim in &quot;The Store&quot; wars. Apparently I needed a Microsoft account to even boot into W10S. I got caught up in &quot;Extend&quot;.<p>I tried to install an X11 Windows server. That&#x27;s when I found out that W10S only allows software from &quot;The Store&quot;. That negates the whole idea of developing free software and making sure it runs everywhere. So I tried to make this new machine more &quot;free software developer friendly&quot;.<p>You can turn off the &quot;S&quot; (Store?) lockdown, which I did.<p>The WSL2 setup was a great failing struggle (I won&#x27;t bore you with details) so I decided to dual-boot the machine. That way I could do both MS and Linux development in their native environments.<p>I burned a thumbdrive with Ubuntu 20, booted it, and tried to set up a dual-boot.<p>That failed because Ubuntu installer could not find any disk space.<p>Boot W10 and shrink the file system.<p>Boot Ubuntu. Still no disk available.<p>Boot into BIOS. Disk is RAID6. Change to ACHI.<p>Boot Ubuntu. Still no disk available.<p>Boot W10 fails.<p>Boot BIOS, change back to RAID6.<p>Boot W10. Hard disk is encrypted. Remove encryption.<p>... (skip more of a 2 day struggle) ...<p>Get angry that I can&#x27;t seem to use hardware <i>I BOUGHT</i>. (Part of the hidden cost of free software development nobody mentions because, ya know, it&#x27;s FREE!).<p>Boot BIOS. Change to ACHI.<p>Boot Ubuntu. Install Ubuntu on whole drive, removing W10.<p>Everyone hears how the big companies are &quot;all-in&quot; on free software support. But the dancing elephants of large corporations are stomping all over the grass and free software is being crushed (Extinguish) as a side-effect.",
