      "text": "This won&#x27;t be taking place for quite some time (at least a year out, maybe more), but I would like to travel the US by RV for 6-12 months. Given the rising gas prices, I was wondering whether there are any options for electric RVs that I can buy. I&#x27;ve seen a couple[1] of options that have been announced, but they seem to suffer from the same issue that many other EV options have in being years out from the announcement and&#x2F;or concepts.<p>I&#x27;ve looked into getting an electric vehicle (like a Rivian or F-150 lightning) and towing behind a camper trailer, which isn&#x27;t a <i>bad</i> option per-se, but I&#x27;m just not sure that&#x27;s the best option. It seems to me that the surface area on an RV is a wonderful opportunity for solar panels which is something that most EVs don&#x27;t really have.<p>Any and all thoughts would be appreciated.<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidehook.com&#x2F;daily_brief&#x2F;vehicles&#x2F;electric-rvs-concepts-real",
