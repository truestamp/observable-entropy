      "text": "Hello HN!<p>Long-time lurker here. I&#x27;d appreciate some feedback on what to use, i.e., some sort of a database, or Google Programmable Search.<p>Background. I am putting together a website which will host files - primarily PDF at first - of publicly available information, for example, company annual reports, government notices, and other types of file formats (e.g. Excel, Word).<p>I am still fleshing out what problem I want this site to solve (it&#x27;s broadly defined in my mind, but not laser-focused as yet).<p>However, what I do want is that the site - or rather the collection of documents on the site - be searchable by visitors.<p>I&#x27;m not a database specialist, and most websites that I do are largely static using HTML and CSS. Given the &#x27;unstructured&#x27; data that I will be accumulating, I was reading up on NoSQL type solutions vs. traditional RDBMS.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any thoughts&#x2F;feedback&#x2F;suggestions on what I should use for site search.<p>Thank you.",
