      "text": "As many people know, a database engine is usually designed and built to either do transactions well (OLTP) or analytic operations well (OLAP), but not both. There are a few databases on the market that claim to do both kinds, but I don&#x27;t know how well they do in each case.<p>I have created a new kind of general-purpose data management system called Didgets that uses a bunch of key-value stores I invented to attach metadata tags to data objects. It turns out that these same key-value stores work really well in creating columnar-store relational tables. I have created some pretty big tables with it (1000 columns, 200M rows) and it does queries extremely fast.<p>Like other columnar stores, it seems to do analytic operations faster than row-oriented systems, but it can also do transactions pretty fast too. On my desktop I can insert additional rows into a 15M row, 10 column table at a rate of about 100K&#x2F;sec. The latest video on my youtube channel (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC-L1oTcH0ocMXShifCt4JQQ) shows it doing that while also doing analytic operations as the data grows.<p>Since my experience with file systems is much more than with databases (I don&#x27;t build data warehouses and do ETL); I don&#x27;t know how important this feature is. I don&#x27;t want to waste time refining this ability and trying to promote it if no one finds that feature particularly useful.<p>Who is using mixed workload databases and why?",
