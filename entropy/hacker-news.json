      "text": "Hello HN, I&#x27;ve been at my current company for the past 15 years. I&#x27;ve taken on different roles where I started as a software engineer, before being promoted to lead, and then to staff engineer. I know my current company by heart. I know how to get things done. I know who to talk to and how to talk to the right people. I know the processes of my company in and out.<p>I decided to get out of my comfort zone. Try something new, I told myself on and on for the past 3 years. And I finally did it. I&#x27;m changing jobs.<p>I&#x27;m going to a new company, where I&#x27;ll be doing something slightly similar to my previous role, but in a totally new field. I don&#x27;t know anyone there. Although, the people seem extremely friendly and fun to work with. This is what I felt in the hiring process.<p>It feels like I forgot how I got good at this. Technically, I have no doubts to get things done. However, on the people level, I have no clue how to get started. How do I make &quot;new friends&quot; at work?<p>What do you usually do when you switch to a new company? How do you go from the &quot;new clueless person at work&quot; to &quot;oh hey Mike, I&#x27;ll need your help this afternoon&quot;?",
