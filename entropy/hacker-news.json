      "text": "I have an undergrad in computer science and a PhD in an interdisciplinary discipline. I have a decade of programming experience. I would like to build a web app which I think has lots of use cases. I would like to build it myself as I think at this point I am the best person to execute my vision.<p>I don&#x27;t really have much experience in web dev. So when I tried to research which technology to use I am completely out of my wits as to what to use. There are so many frameworks based on so many use cases of which I don&#x27;t even have a clear idea. How can I learn to build my web app in the quickest amount of time possible?",
