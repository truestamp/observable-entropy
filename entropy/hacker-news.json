I also have a side project which is a website for ongoing text-based interviews called Taaalk (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taaalk.co). I am looking to interview someone about Kafka, starting with the basics and getting increasingly complex (eventually with some code examples).<p>[To get a better understanding of a format, here is an example of a Taaalk: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taaalk.co&#x2F;t&#x2F;repopulating-the-taaalk-database-from-archive-org. It is a quite meta, as it is myself and another software engineer discussing how to repopulate the Taaalk database from an archive.org download after a server incident which wiped my database. However, it should give you an idea of the format.]<p>If you are interested in &quot;Taaalking&quot; with me about Kafka, please get in touch via the email on my profile.<p>Thank you!",
