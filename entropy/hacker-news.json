To address the difficulty of maintaining personal connections for remote teams—we made a little Slack app called HotPizza<p>It sends fun icebreaker questions to a Slack channel daily or weekly (you can also &#x2F;hotpizza for random icebreakers for meetings, team onboarding..etc). While we wait for approval in the Slack app directory, a few dozen teams are using the beta on an ongoing basis.<p>Would love to see if anyone here would want to try it out and hear what you think!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hotpizza.io",
