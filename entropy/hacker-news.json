(Maybe something like BIT?)<p>As someone who attempted to become a SWE for a few years now and failed miserably I have to say it is gut wrenching to see most people around me making absurds amount of money while I’m still stuck in the learning phase. But I hope that will chance soon.<p>If you can live knowing you have the opportunity to easily make well over 6 figures and work from anywhere but decide to do something else, power to you. I genuinely hope that in 10 years you have that same mentality but there’s a good chance you won’t.<p>TLDR: investing the majority of your time and money into becoming a software engineer provides the greatest return on money and work&#x2F;life balance by an almost unfathomable margin.",
