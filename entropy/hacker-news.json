Being an engineer I started thinking about how to solve the problem and avoid wasting time and&#x2F;or being scammed.<p>I thought there ought to exist a list of annoying phone numbers like those that have been created for malicious&#x2F;advertising domains but I could not find any.<p>Why is it so that nobody thought of it?

      "text": "For years anxiety&#x2F;fear-avoidance cycle defined my life. I tend to procrastinate to a such extent that causes problems in my day to day functioning, and generally my life.<p>For example, i have to submit 2 fairly simple assignments, in 2 and 3 days respectively. If i don&#x27;t pass the next 4 assignments i will fail the lab, but i keep avoiding sitting down with all of my power. I feel pure fear and a sense of &quot;i will certainly fail if i try&quot;.<p>The above example is with these assignments, but this type of behavior extends to everything in my life.",
