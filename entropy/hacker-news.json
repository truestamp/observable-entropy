      "text": "No one can look at the construction of this jaunty little aphorism and still be tempted to take it literally. Back in the seventies or eighties, when we believed that we invented this meme, we understood it to mean that expertise is not granted along with the diploma or the job title. You had to earn what we now call &quot;your 10,000 hours&quot;. From this perspective, most of us are or were faking it and the only ones who are not are those who have been assiduously working, learning and growing from their field of pursuit for years or even decades.<p>This is the &quot;making it&quot;. not the title. not the salary. It doesn&#x27;t happen with the 4 or 6 years of college. it doesn&#x27;t happen after the internship or the big promotion. but, at some point, you will notice that what was once an educated pose is now a reasoned and seasoned position. A firm stance that can withstand the buffeting forces of life and the workplace.\nWork for this. Work to constantly improve your skills and your knowledge in every aspect of life and science and even business. Work to make yourself useful if not indispensable. Then, look to be your own boss by launching your career as a business owner. Then, you can start faking it all over again.\nSigned,\nAmerican Huckster\n20 years working for the man – now retiring after 24 years of owning my own business.",
