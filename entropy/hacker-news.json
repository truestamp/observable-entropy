      "text": "I spend so much of my work and leisure time on devices and have been trying to reduce this. For example, I&#x27;ve recently switched to an iPod Classic for a lot of my music listening which has been quite nice.<p>I also spend a lot of time browsing and reading interesting articles, particularly on HN and want to replace some of that with &#x27;offline&#x27; alternatives. When it comes to other hobbies (sports, music) I have found some great magazines still in circulation that can work as alternatives to browsing online.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your suggestions for tech related magazines, ideally things I can subscribe to and get monthly&#x2F;quarterly. These should be varied enough to cover the kind of topics we see here on HN daily as opposed to super general tech news type magazines.",
