      "text": "I have found that music (and sound in general) can be a very powerful tool to help focus. But it goes both ways. Listening to the right, repetitive song or noises can help me achieve my focused &quot;flow state&quot; much faster. Conversely, listening to new music, music with lyrics, or any irregular noises will destroy my concentration pretty fast.<p>For me, I think it comes down to isolating myself from unexpected stimuli while trying to focus. Listening to a video game song on loop, relatively loudly to block out external noise, is something that has worked well for me.<p>However, everybody is different. Do you listen to music &#x2F; white noise &#x2F; etc while working? If so, what&#x27;s your go-to?",
