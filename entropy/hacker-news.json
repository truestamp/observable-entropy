      "text": "Does anyone know of any tools for detecting audio oversaturation?  This is like when audio &quot;goes into the red&quot; (i.e., on old-school meters). I find my ears are very sensitive to this, and I can detect it. Meanwhile, I frequently encounter others who cannot hear it at all - they just hear &quot;loud&quot;, and they like it.  It would be nice to have some kind of tool that can give some kind of reading on this.  It may not be perfect -- based on machine learning, but at least it&#x27;s a repeatable reading for a given segment of digital audio.",
