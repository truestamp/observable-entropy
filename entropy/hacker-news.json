      "text": "One day I was having a call with my client, and typing at the same time to note down the key points.\nBut my client, got frustrated with my typing noise and said, &quot;Can you please stop typing?&quot; I was so embarrassed that I can&#x27;t even put it into words.\nSo, after the meeting, I went to Google and typed, &quot;Take meeting notes automatically&quot;. It suggested to me a few AI tools or you can say transcription tools. Well for people who don&#x27;t know, transcription tools convert our meeting audio into text.\nI started using the best transcription tool in the market. But then I discovered something hilarious that blew my mind completely. We speak 5000+ words in just 30 minutes meeting, I spent another 25 minutes reading and making short notes out of that transcript.\nAfter a few meetings and wasting my time, I got more frustrated, called my co-founder and asked, &quot;Why can&#x27;t we kill Transcription? It&#x27;s wasting my 30% of working time.&quot; He said we could kill it if we could build an algo that calculates importance for every sentence we speak and put only those sentences as short notes which have a higher threshold.\nThat&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s been a few months; we developed our AI algo to kill Transcription once and for all. Now today 2000+ people stopped wasting time on transcription and use our meeting summarization tool. We call it, Instaminutes. It&#x27;s our baby.\nHave you been in the same situation with your meetings? Please share your story in the comment.\nPlease upvote it, if you think, we can make your meeting lives easier.",

      "text": "I thought HN crowd might enjoy noodling this. I am a commercial real estate broker working with a large developer in a major North American city. This is the type of prisoner&#x27;s dilemma I face.<p>Let&#x27;s say we try to assembly a lot that consists of 10 properties with different owners (different sized lots). Developers can pay around x per buildable square foot, and that amount is higher for each individual owner than what they could get if they are selling their property individually. The fair way to pay everyone is to divide total amount the land is worth to the developer proportionally by lot size to each owner.<p>This is the problem that always arises: people get greedy. Not everyone, but at least 2 out of these 10 owner will be unreasonable. If everyone, or enough people get greedy, it kills the deal. On the other hand people who are greedy and hold out get more than people who are more amiable. So, from the stand point of the owner who wants to maximize their proceeds being greedy works, but only if everyone else is not.<p>I only get paid if the deal closes. If you were me how would you approach this prisoner&#x27;s dilemma from my side?<p>Let&#x27;s start with I have amount M that the land is worth, I have 10 owners with different sized lots. Now what? I have a goal to buy up the 10 lots at M or below. What should my strategy be here? I have to tie all the lots at the same time (I have 60 days from the day the first property is tied up, to buy the last one).<p>Thank you for your thoughts!",
