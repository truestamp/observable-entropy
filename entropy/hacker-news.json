      "text": "I am an ML engineer from eastern europe. About 8 years in the industry in total, 4 in ML. I am torn between two offers.<p>The first is full remote, flexible, $120k+ a year total comp, and involves being the main and only DS guy for a small startup. Great pay (4x my current totalcomp) and perks. The ML I am going to do is kind of boring. This role will probably give me good business experience.<p>The second one is office with relocation to Portugal, making ML&#x2F;CV for cutting edge industrial robotics, working under a very strong professor. But only $45k total comp. Maybe they can give me $80k a year tops (still negotiating).<p>I have never had such a hard choice between jobs in my life. Usually I choose based on long term returns. But here long term returns are good for both options, but in different aspects. For my financials the first one is way better, for my skills the second one is way better.<p>What would you choose? Have you had experience choosing money over opportunity or vise versa, and regretting it?",
