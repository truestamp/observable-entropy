      "text": "Hi all, I am looking for feedback.<p>I am launching Rubick, a free Data API &amp; Search API service for commonly used datasets such as countries, currencies, cities, etc.<p>My goal is to make it easier for developers to build applications that involve 1.) users entering their country &#x2F; city, and 2.) users filtering any content by country &#x2F; city.<p>The latest datasets are as follows:<p>- ISO 3166 Countries<p>- ISO 4217 Currencies<p>- UN M49 Areas<p>- PHL Areas<p>- PHL Postal Codes &#x2F; Zip Codes<p>All of these documented at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rubick.io.<p>I&#x27;m looking to add USA areas &amp; USA postal codes soon.<p>The Data API lets you access the entire datasets. For example, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.rubick.io&#x2F;iso&#x2F;countries will give you all the ISO-recognized countries.<p>The Search API lets you search through the datasets. For example, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;search.rubick.io&#x2F;iso&#x2F;countries?q=usa will give you the list of countries matching the &quot;usa&quot; query.<p>Some of my thoughts:<p>- Do you find something like this useful?<p>- Currently I&#x27;m offering both the Data API and the Search API for free, but the Search API (powered by TypeSense) can be overloaded with a lot of users since it&#x27;s just hosted on a small server. Do you think people will be willing to pay for scalability (e.g. having it on better servers, for search-as-you-type service)?<p>Thank you.",
