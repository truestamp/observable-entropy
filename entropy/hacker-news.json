      "text": "In my free time, I&#x27;ve slowly been putting together a proper professional&#x27;s ultranotebook. For me, that&#x27;s a screen under 10 inches, a keyboard that doesn&#x27;t suck, connectivity, insane battery life.<p>At the moment, I&#x27;ve frankensteined a machine with the following  specs:<p>Display: 7.8 inch eInk display, 300 PPI. 5 finger touchscreen.<p>CPU: 2 (2.2 GHz Kryo 660 Gold – Cortex-A78) + 6 (1.7 GHz Kryo 660 Silver – Cortex-A55)<p>GPU: Adreno 619<p>RAM: 4 GB LDDR4X but ideally min. 16 GB<p>Connectivity: 5G&#x2F;LTE, BT 5.2<p>Battery: 137.7 mAh, hit 144 hours on 115mAh set-up on intensive drain cycle in browser, no optimization for battery implemented OS-side yet. Just long enough so you also can rest on the 7th day.<p>Typing: 60% keyboard with Cherry switches, low-profile<p>OS: ChromeOS&#x2F;Android&#x2F;Linux all work. I&#x27;d like to port OpenBSD once I can sort some driver issues.<p>I am confident, even with current supplier issues, this could be sold at under $1000 easily. My ideal price-point would be $699 but the likely one is $849&#x2F;$899 based on comps for the parts and quotes I&#x27;ve received.<p>Is this something anyone other than me is interested in? Or am I just crazy?",
