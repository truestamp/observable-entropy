      "text": "One of the hassles of C&#x2F;C++ programming is maintaining header files; including the right ones to resolve missing symbols, keeping declarations and definitions in sync, preventing circular dependencies with pragmas or include guards, etc.<p>In the past on large codebases I&#x27;ve used IDE plugins - Visual Assist X [1] lets you change function signatures, create declarations from definitions and vise versa, and add the include for a missing symbol. I&#x27;m no longer using Visual Studio proper though for C stuff so that&#x27;s no longer available to me.<p>I recently stumbled on makeheaders [2] by sqlite&#x27;s creator, used for the fossil version control codebase - it let&#x27;s you write just the C files, and generates corresponding header files during build, with help from some macro keywords. Seems like a promising approach.<p>Curious what other solutions people have used to eliminate the unnecessary busywork of header files?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wholetomato.com<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hwaci.com&#x2F;sw&#x2F;mkhdr&#x2F;",
