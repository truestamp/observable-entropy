Not having to worry \nabout memory allocation is such a relief.<p>The last 2 points are surprisingly a common pattern now,\nbut for someone coming from C[2] and shell scripting\nits a whole different world here.<p>======<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30749134\n[1]: In school we were made to write units next to values,\nNow that ive seen it, i ask myself why don&#x27;t more languages support this.\n[2]: i&#x27;m aware of function pointers in C but its something\nthat i rarely used(iirc qsort expected it).",
