Macbooks are so slim and lightweight, while an Inspiron or Thinkpad is so bulky and thick. Which engineering aspect is superior in case of Macbooks that makes it slimmer and less bulkier compared to those? Is it the OS - the way it has been written, it requires less cooling and hence lesser bulk? Or is it something else?",
