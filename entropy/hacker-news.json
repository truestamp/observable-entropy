I started off going for 90% unit tests, but since I’m hacking alone, it ends up taking a bunch of time to keep the tests up to date.<p>Im thinking of keeping all the old unit tests, but switching to a full integration E2E testing system. This way, I can just text features as opposed to code paths.<p>By day I work at &lt;insert tech giant here&gt;, and I would never push up code without it being unit tested, so it feels a little painful to ship with only integration tests.<p>Thoughts? For those of you who’ve shipped small projects, what tests did you find had the most benefit?",
