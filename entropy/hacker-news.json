      "text": "Bad: A bad Lisp dialect written in C<p>I was going to wait a while before I posted this anywhere but I figured I&#x27;d release early and see where it goes.<p>This is my first real C application after years of indirectly avoiding it. What a life you all (C developers) live. Very fun once you get the hang of it but I&#x27;ve had to learn things that I didn&#x27;t even know were challenges in computing and language design. It&#x27;s eye opening!<p>I&#x27;m also new to Lisp which is why there&#x27;s not really many features at the moment. At first I was going to just implement Arc but I think I&#x27;ll save that for when I&#x27;m more skilled.<p>If anyone has any feedback on the code, implementation, anything, feel free to let me know! Above all else, I want to learn. I can take criticism. In fact that is why I am posting such a new project. :)<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bit-42&#x2F;bad",
