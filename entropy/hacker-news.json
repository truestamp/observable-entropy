      "text": "We have a client who are looking to replace zoom in their org. They like to self-host everything, and are wary of using outside services. We help them run their own email, and over the years we have helped them set up GitLab and Mattermost, etc which they are happy enough with.<p>We&#x27;ve set up a Jitsi installation but our stakeholders are wary about the limits on number of participants -- they can&#x27;t really do department meetings or let alone an all-hands type of meeting with ~1000 people on the call.  Also, some parts of their org are invested in the zoom usage&#x2F;meeting stats too, and so that is another piece we&#x27;d have to figure out.  We&#x27;ve also had mixed results testing with team members far away on rough connections, where audio&#x2F;video was workable in zoom but sometimes unworkable with our internal setup.<p>Has anyone scaled up to 1000 and beyond with any open source solution? Any stories of success or failure? Are there other options to consider than Jitsi?  Why is there no one crushing it like GitLab or Mattermost in this space?",
