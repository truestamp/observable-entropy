      "text": "Do you want the immersion of VR but still want to be aware of your surroundings?<p>VR systems allow remote collaboration, but the user is cut off from their real world environment and is not able to see their real world surroundings.  This is where Exanaview&#x27;s Immersive AR technology comes in.  With Exanaview AR, a portion of your real world is immersive, so you can still see and interact with the rest of your real world surroundings.  You can collaborate with remote peers during a design review of a large 1:1 scale model while still being able to see family members while working from home or see and talk to co-workers while working at the office.<p>Coming recently out of stealth, Exanaview&#x27;s patented immersive AR is the only AR technology on the market today that provides immersive multi peer collaboration while still allowing users to see their real world surroundings.  See a demo of the technology at the video link below and sign up for access at the website link below.<p>Exanaview&#x27;s new Immersive AR feature:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=h67Qx1b2uUE<p>Exanaview&#x27;s website:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.exanaview3d.com&#x2F;",

She is interested in computers and wants to learn to program and&#x2F;or do creative tasks with it.<p>I&#x27;m an engineer myself and want to help her explore technology as I was curious from a young age as well and it&#x27;s how I got started. RPG Maker 95 single handledly got me into programming!<p>Money isn&#x27;t an issue, but I&#x27;d rather not purchase something like a MacBook. I am hoping to find a more open device and have her explore more of it with me.<p>My current thinking is:<p>1. Raspberry Pi, we could set one up with a monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.<p>2. PineBook Pro, seems relatively open and capable enough for her needs.<p>As or software, I am also open to suggestions. I have done Scratch Jr with her on an iPad in the past and she liked it. I am thinking of using Scratch with a keyboard and mouse to get her typing and learning logic&#x2F;creating stuff.<p>I&#x27;d love additional suggestions of fun&#x2F;creative software available on Linux.",
