      "text": "Hi,\nI am building a SaaS product(B2B) and now looking to build billing related functionality. My company is a Delaware corporation.<p>I am planning to use Stripe billing with Stripe Taxes which removes a lot of complexity and help monitor the tax compliance in US. Most states in the US seem to have certain threshold before I require to register for taxes to be compliant. However I am confused about selling internationally (esp. Europe) and my obligations for collecting VAT.<p>The documentation pretty much says &quot;consult with a tax expert&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if I should spend the money and time dealing with all the complexity before I launch the product. I am thinking there must be a simpler way to navigate this.<p>If you previously launched a startup, how did you handle the billing and tax complexity?",
