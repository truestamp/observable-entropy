      "text": "My grandmother has a Windows 10 PC that looks like it was set up by Geek Squad. We used the built-in Quick Assist app and while I  was in I saw a new browser, &quot;Wave Browser&quot;, it looks like snuck into her AppData directory. There&#x27;s also an anti-virus, Webroot, I believe was installed by Geek Squad, which is now out-of-license.<p>She&#x27;s called me a few times since, complaining of not remembering her passwords and other small things. I&#x27;m worried she&#x27;s going to have her identity stolen with passwords that are literally her username plus a symbol.<p>How can I best help in 2022? I&#x27;ve looked at Alexa Together, which provides everything but remote access. I&#x27;m considering getting her to use a password manager but I&#x27;m doubtful she&#x27;ll remember how it works or that her passwords were generated by the built-in password generator if Chrome.<p>Sometimes she&#x27;ll call me to ask for help but I&#x27;ll tell her she needs to first open the Windows search menu then type in Quick Assist and exchange codes but even that whole process seems to stress her out. Should I suggest unattended access? And if so, what&#x27;s the best option? Anydesk Unattended Access?<p>Windows seems like an incredibly hostile OS but I&#x27;m worried buying her a Chromebook will just be too much for her to handle even though it&#x27;s just Chrome (which she already uses).<p>HN, I need your help!",
