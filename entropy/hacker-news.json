      "text": "My new kink is responding to recruiters who ask for my current salary by asking them for the total comp for the role they&#x27;re recruiting for.<p>It&#x27;s purely for entertainment, of course - I won&#x27;t even meet with them after that. A company that asks your current salary is asking to find out how little they can pay you. They are seeking to create and exploit a superior bargaining position that results from unequal knowledge - they know how much you make and how much they pay, but you only know one of those things. And that&#x27;s how they treat you <i>before</i> you start working there.<p>I doubt that companies who do this can be persuaded to stop.<p>But if I were a VC, it might give me pause to learn that a company in my portfolio does this. Knowing that the make or break comes down to people - or at least suspecting that might matter - might make me worry about a company that rejects valuing the one single resource that decides the whole ballgame.<p>Anywho, my nonsense aside, the object of the game is to see how many messages a recruiter will respond with before giving an actual compensation number. An unsolicited phone call counts as two messages. My current record is 7.",

I wrote an introductory SRE Book:<p>Site Reliability Engineering Tidbits<p>and it&#x27;s free today!<p>These are short fun chapters about SRE, monitoring, debugging, observability, and resiliency.<p>This book aims to provide hands on examples of implementing a number of concepts described in Google&#x27;s SRE books. It also describes how i&#x27;ve seen SRE concepts impact some of the organizations I&#x27;ve worked in.<p>A couple chapters are hands on debugging exercises going through the process of debugging applications based on data. I&#x27;m excited because every chapter describes something that I&#x27;ve done in paying jobs, so it documents real life SRE in action at various size organizations, and not theoretical SRE concepts.",
