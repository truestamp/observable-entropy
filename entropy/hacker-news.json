The explanation of a problem solution given by a source often involves a key insight, but there&#x27;s never an explanation of how to reliably come up with key insights!<p>I&#x27;ve looked for tips and tricks, but the answer appears to be either &quot;do thousands of logic and math problems and gain an instinct for it&quot; or &quot;have any extremely high IQ&quot;.<p>Any thoughts?",
