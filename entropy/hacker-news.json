But my sexual desires do not get me anywhere in life, Infact it&#x27;s counter productive and takes me away from better pursuit in life like conduction green energy research, working on my hobbies etc...<p>I am usually pretty chill person, but I have begin to notice when met with sexual tension and sexual competition, I go crazy and start acting selfish. I do not like it and often time I only introspect my behavior when things have already happened.<p>I am not even seeking any romantic partner so mostly it ends up having to visit escort or watching porn, both of which I am finding immoral lately and waste of time, energy and money. But I can&#x27;t seem to exercise control over my behavior resulting from sexual desire. So I&#x27;ve reached conclusion that if I do not have sexual desires to begin with, I&#x27;d be a much better person.<p>Is there any work that is being done to kill sexual desires for people who do not want it? I am pretty sure army would have done any research on it?",
