      "text": "Before I go further - let me clarify what I mean by &quot;meaningful&quot;. There are two criteria that I consider, internal value and external value.<p>External value is what fundamental value or service is the company I&#x27;m working for providing for the world? Is our net impact helping or hurting people? How severe is that impact? Etc. For a job to be meaningful the external value has to be such that there is a substantial, positive impact in the lives of our customers or community .<p>Internal value is how meaningful the day to day labor is to myself. Am I being challenged? Am I solving problems? Do I wake up and <i>want</i> to work? Etc.<p>If either of these values are significantly lacking, I don&#x27;t consider the work meaningful. I&#x27;m still relatively early on in my SW career, but I&#x27;ve thus far had a difficult time finding work that meets my definition of meaningful. I&#x27;d happily take a pay-cut or work longer hours if I felt what I was doing was meaningful, but I just can&#x27;t find it and I&#x27;m not sure if perhaps I&#x27;m looking in the wrong places or if it just doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>So, to those of you who work jobs you consider to be meaningful, how did you find that position? What advice would you impart to a young engineer who doesn&#x27;t want to spend his career working on things he doesn&#x27;t really care about?",
