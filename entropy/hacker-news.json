      "text": "Long story short, I&#x27;ve had a pretty lucrative ($XXX,XXX) contracting gig for a few years, I built a great relationship and basically did work nobody else in the entire company could do. There&#x27;s now new directors, SVPs, etc. who basically know nothing about this business but are implementing generic BS like Agile and OKRs that are nothing more than busy work.<p>One of the two people who hired me recently left, and the other basically ignored my message when I asked who I should submit my timesheets to. I&#x27;ve been coasting (I&#x27;ve always stood out as an above average engineer because of my creativity and past business experience) for a while with great pay, but I think the gravy train is ending.<p>I&#x27;m not happy with my role and while I&#x27;m still being paid and nobody bothers me, I feel like I have no purpose in the overall new direction things are going and I find the new people incompetent as well. They&#x27;re generic engineers who want to build cool technology instead of solving the actual business problems I&#x27;ve seen working 1-1 with so many people across the org top to bottom.<p>I don&#x27;t plan to leave until they fire me, because I barely do any work and get paid but at the same time I feel slighted by the person who I&#x27;ve worked for for not responding, and I suffered an injury because of this work too (I burned days nonstop trying to build something at one point and injured myself, may need surgery).<p>I don&#x27;t really feel like getting a new job because I&#x27;d have to work for more than 10 hours a week, but I also don&#x27;t like hopping onto Slack and only having 2 - 3 people message me over a week or two, and I don&#x27;t really have ownership over anything besides a small project with lots of delays and back and forth with nothing to do in between.<p>Feel kind of lost and like there&#x27;s no future. So I ask HN, if anyone else has been here before, what should I do?",
