      "text": "I have been on a couple of fun road trips, which involved carefully choosing nicer locations using a lot of online search, browsing through articles, blogs etc. However, some of the most interesting places I found were just because I happen to drive past an interesting road sign and I decided to stop by it.<p>I am looking to visualize this data using my google maps location tracking. Since there is a ton of information there, which I can export as kml files, however, I don&#x27;t want to do the manual work of creating the visualization since there must be a tool that already does that.<p>Either-ways, ping me if you&#x27;re interested in hashing out a good solution for this, I have a couple of ideas I want to soundboard.",
