      "text": "Hey HN,<p>As most of you (I think?), I cannot learn something without having a project, on the side, to implement what I’ve just learned.<p>Recode is the project that I&#x27;ve used to learn Go. It lets you create a development environment in your cloud provider account easily.<p>You can think of it as a desktop version of Gitpod &#x2F; Coder &#x2F; GitHub Codespaces less polished and with less features but 100% free and open-source.<p>At the time of writing, it only works with Visual Studio Code and AWS.<p>In order to let you configure your development environments easily, I’ve chosen to use Docker with some Dockerfiles:<p><pre><code>  - One for your user configuration.\n   \n  - One for your project.\n</code></pre>\nThe user configuration corresponds to the tools &#x2F; settings that you use in all your projects like your timezone &#x2F; locale, your preferred shell or your dotfiles.<p>The project configuration corresponds to the tools &#x2F; settings that you use in a specific project like Go &gt;= 1.18 and Node.js &gt;= 14.<p>As you may have guessed, the project configuration inherits from the user one.<p>This project is 100% community-driven, meaning that except for bug fixes no more features will be added.<p>The only features that will be added are the ones that will be posted as an issue and that will receive a significant amount of upvotes (&gt;= 10 currently).",
