      "text": "I&#x27;ve been asked to create a coding test to assess candidates during the hiring process.<p>I have mixed feelings about coding tests; they increase the entry barrier and put the company at risk of losing the busiest persons (who may otherwise be very good).<p>My own experience has also been mixed. Sometimes the test is poorly written and thus speaks badly about the company (why should I put the effort in taking a test when the person who wrote it didn&#x27;t take the time to fix the grammar and the requirements?). Sometimes they feel exploitative (write a simple app for candidates to upload resumes to our company, write a case study over the tools you would use to create our new data analysis platform).<p>Also, don&#x27;t get me started about the algorithm test you find on many online services.<p>I also don&#x27;t like when I&#x27;m asked to take a coding test before talking with the company at least once.<p>Still, a well-written coding test may speak well about the company and could be positive in getting the tech interview started.<p>What&#x27;s a good coding test you&#x27;d feel like doing? And what other advice can you give me about that, besides the raw coding challenge?<p>In case you ask, I&#x27;m looking for a good developer with a good attitude regarding team play (this is probably not testable with a coding test, but it felt worth saying).<p>Thank you in advance for any suggestions! :)",
