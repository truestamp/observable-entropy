      "text": "Hey HN,<p>How does a non-profit go about raising funds? I help run a small (11 employees, most of who are part-time) non-profit located just an hour outside Savannah, GA. We&#x27;ve been given an offer to buy the building we currently are renting. The issue, we aren&#x27;t making a ton of profit, so we don&#x27;t have much to put towards a business loan.<p>The services we offer are already on the higher end of &quot;Low Cost&quot;, so we can&#x27;t really raise our prices much more than we currently have them at.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at the SBA, and they don&#x27;t actually offer loans to non-profits. We do get some good funds from facebook (individuals donating) when we ask for donations for tough cases, but when we try to raise funds for capital expenses, crickets.<p>We are a spay&#x2F;neuter clinic and animal rescue. I know we are never going to be rolling in the funds, but to have some grants, or even long term loans to help ease the pressure and let us buy our location would be nice.<p>Any suggestions? I&#x27;ll stick my email in my profile. If you have any questions that you want to directly contact me with, feel free to reach out. Just put that it&#x27;s from HN so I know it&#x27;s not junk. You would be surprised at the amount of junk offers we get.",

      "text": "I hate how my company does performance ratings. I don&#x27;t like how managers have the ICs basically write their own performance examples. Why waste resource time doing this? Shouldnt the role of a manager be to absorb as much overhead work as possible so their workers can focus on output&#x2F;outcomes? I feel like this model leads to promotion of people who are just good at telling people what they want to hear or spend a lot more time on documenting and writing up their examples.",
