      "text": "In technical writing we have a concept of reviewing a draft in passes. First you review for technical accuracy. Then you review for completeness. Then you review for clarity. And so on. The key idea is that with each pass you only focus on that specific aspect of writing quality. I&#x27;m wondering if you all employ a similar technique for code reviews, what kinds of passes you do, and the usual order of passes?",

      "text": "Hey HN crowd.<p>I&#x27;m a new manager in a relatively large company (think FAANG) and just went through a training for employee performance training.<p>For each direct report, we are expected to provide a rating (meet expectations, does not meet, exceed etc.), but in addition to that, we also need to &quot;rank&quot; each individual within each rating, with the goal of helping our director do a &quot;calibration&quot; that will basically curve overall ratings at the org&#x2F;company level (meaning that someone who meets expectations may be pushed down to &quot;does not meet&quot;, purely to match some statistics).<p>My knee jerk reaction here was that this was pretty unethical, after all, if someone does meet expectations and the data is there, it should be possible to give them the corresponding rating &#x2F; comp increase? But then after talking with other manager friends from other companies, it does seem to be something that a lot of companies do to some extent...<p>So here comes my question: what do you guys think of this practice? Is it an acceptable business practice? Should such companies be named and shamed?",
