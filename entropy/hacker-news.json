Even if we somehow manage to not find ourselves in a nuclear holocaust, there is no escape from climate change.<p>I really want to be optimistic, both for me and the people around me, but it&#x27;s hard to see how or why I could start being an optimist.<p>Reading the stoics didn&#x27;t have a significant effect; it felt more like a coping mechanism than a way forward. Moving to an industry that tries to build a future - not a better future, just a future - is quite challenging without a meaningful background in hard sciences. &quot;Think globally, act locally&quot; is a dogma I&#x27;ve been following since forever but it feels insufficient when it comes to some of the great challenges we are going to face soon.<p>Help me and others like me see the world with different eyes.",
