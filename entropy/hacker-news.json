      "text": "I am reconsidering my setup for reading technical books in the most efficient (i.e. knowledge retaining) way. I am wondering what other people on HN do.<p>I normally read books on my kindle but this doesn&#x27;t work for technical books with graphics and the need to go back&#x2F;forth between pages. Normally when I know I won&#x27;t be implementing anything I will use my iPad to read a PDF, but I&#x27;ve found that reading technical books without keeping notes isn&#x27;t very useful. This means my laptop would be the best way to read and write down notes, but I would rather not sit at my desk even more than I already do.",
