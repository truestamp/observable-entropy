It&#x27;s obvious that this is out of control. Users are reporting this.<p>Thousands of twitter accounts are being hacked daily to spam and defraud people out of thousands of dollars&#x2F;day in crypto. Unlimited number of hacked accounts. There is probably some exploit that allows this. I remember a long time ago trying to contact twitter about how hackers could steal accounts through something like a cloud cluster to change ips.<p>When thousands of accounts are being hacked daily to post the same message to the the same accounts (elon and space x) for months on end, I don&#x27;t see how twitter cannot not be aware of this problem.<p>Like july 2020 hack but everyday and thousands of accounts&#x2F;day<p>How much money do ppl have to lose before something is done. $200 million? That is like a years worth of ransomware. I think one person made $20 million in 3 months from elon twitter spam and a few others made millions. Easily tens of millions of dollars a year in revenues.",
