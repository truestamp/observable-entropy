      "text": "I was recently contacted by an Amazon recruiter and asked to apply for a few jobs in my area. Upon realizing that I gave him the email of my regular Amazon account, I endeavored to re-activate it after it had previously been locked by Amazon for apparent suspicious activity. I&#x27;m fairly sure I called them at the time, with no result, but this time around, they&#x27;re telling me to get fucked, essentially.<p>The first rep I spoke to said that because I had no purchase history in the last year, she was unable to verify my account, even after sending me a 2FA auth code, and refusing to accept any prior confirmation codes or information from any other receipts I had in my archive.<p>The second rep I spoke to said that my account &quot;did not have the information available to answer the questions needed to verify my account&quot; and that she &quot;can&#x27;t tell me what that required information is, because my system tells me the account doesn&#x27;t have it&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve used this account for many years, and yes I haven&#x27;t used it for purchases in a year, because largely I didn&#x27;t have a job and didn&#x27;t have the time to go through a lengthy phone tree. At no point was I told me account would become irrecoverable. Now though, they&#x27;re telling me my only option is to re-create the account with the same email address, obviously losing my purchase history and any documents or other records I&#x27;ve uploaded over the years. This is all not to say there wasn&#x27;t suspicious activity on the account. There was, and I did contact Amazon about this, and they were not able to help me before locking the account.<p>Do I have any recourse? This seems insane. I&#x27;m in Canada.",
