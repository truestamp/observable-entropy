      "text": "Over the past few months I&#x27;ve noticed my child spending quite a bit more time on Scratch (including maintaining multiple accounts).  I recently reviewed this and was surprised that most of the time was spent in open (and seemingly un-moderated by adults) chats. I was curious if others have noticed this morphing and have the same or other concerns?<p>Specifically I have two concerns:<p>1. My child is under 13 and they are certainly sharing private information on this site but none of their accounts required parental consent.  I just opened an account with age &lt; 13 in the US and was also not prompted for parental validation.  This seems to potentially violate the Child Online Privacy Rule in the US [1].<p>2. Many schools encourage and facilitate the use of Scratch but at least in my child&#x27;s case it seems that this has become a loophole to chat and participate in social media during school.<p>To see what I am referring to you can view https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scratch.mit.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;studios&#x2F;all&#x2F;popular and view any of those studios comments sections which are all primarily an open chat unrelated to the projects.<p>Scratch in the past has had some really great offerings and community events not only about coding but also about sharing and creating art.  I&#x27;m disappointed to see that much of the use is not about these at all. Thoughts?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecfr.gov&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;text-idx?SID=4939e77c77a1a1a08c1cbf905fc4b409&amp;node=16%3A1.0.1.3.36&amp;rgn=div5",
