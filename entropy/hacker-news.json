      "text": "Try this:<p>- Start a video on Netflix<p>- Disable wifi<p>- Wait for the video to run out of buffer<p>What happens next (consistently in my case) is that a loading sign appears, which goes from 0% to 99%, and then halts. The fact that it goes to 99% implies to me that it has buffered something but is just waiting a bit more until the buffer is large enough to continue. In reality, my hotspot apparently turned off 5 minutes ago and the 0-&gt;99% loading sign doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Is this okay? It seems very dishonest to me. If my internet is not working, why not notify me so I can look into it?",
