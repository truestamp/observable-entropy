      "text": "Happy New Year folks, I am with three youngsters asking me for AI-driven ideas making sense in 2022. I am not sure I can help: big corps are all over industrial applications, and the internet bubble is so crowded they have no statistical chance with recommenders and content projects. Therefore, their best shot may be looking into something that would come good in two, three or even ten years from now. To put my hat into this, I am thinking of NLP and small robotics for hospices and nursing homes: low cost, low risk, high reward, prospective jobs if they can’t make it as entrepreneurs. Any different ideas? Thanks!",
