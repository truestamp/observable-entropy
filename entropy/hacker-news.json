      "text": "Background: We currently use Argo Workflows to orchestrate end-to-end integration tests.<p>Basically, a set of workflow definitions define containers for all the apps that the tests need (typically 7-8 microservice apps, plus services like databases, caches, etc.). Then the last step of the workflow runs test.<p>The downside is that the workflow needs to duplicate the Kubernetes config that we already deploy with ArgoCD. We keep apps, tests, and ArgoCD definitions in separate repos, and this stuff gets out of sync.<p>Plus, Argo Workflows is not so great. Poor UI, very flaky, relatively slow, and of course everything is YAML, which is horrible to work with.<p>Is there anything better?",
