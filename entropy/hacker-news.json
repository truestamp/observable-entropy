      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;d like to get back into low level programming and learn C properly. I am a seasoned programmer for many years in high level languages. I&#x27;ve done a few small embedded projects on ESP32 and wanted to seriously learn C.<p>What are some of the interesting intermediate&#x2F;advanced resources for learning C? Even if it is not in a &quot;tutorial&quot; format, if you could share some projects, or repositories I should look at and implement my own version? Of course, would welcome C programming books and how to professionally write C avoiding common traps.<p>I&#x27;ve also read K&amp;R cover-to-cover and I found that it lived up to the its popularity. I tried searching on HN but couldn&#x27;t find a definitive thread for learning C specifically.<p>Thank you!",
