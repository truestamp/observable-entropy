      "text": "Hi HN! I’ve been considering adding solar to my home but I really have no idea where to begin. Purchase or lease? What are my giant battery options and which seems best? What kind of requirements are there for the home electrical infra (200 amp, 300 amp, doesn’t matter)? What sort of total cost of installation am I looking at for an average size house on the East Coast (MA, 2000 sqft)<p>Any wisdom or resources would be greatly appreciated.",
