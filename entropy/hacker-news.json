      "text": "Two months ago I posted a list of 61 QUBO formulations and cited every single one (which resulted in 33 links to papers) [0].\nAfter seeing this post get crawled by Google, my traffic dropped permanently by more than 50%. It has also stopped growing (which it did before). Of course, afterwards I noticed my mistake (I suppose Google thought I had become somewhat of a &#x27;link spamming&#x27; site?!). Hindsight is 20&#x2F;20.\nBut I refuse to remove this page, since I find it extremely resourceful and use it all the time in projects (I work on a Quantum Computing startup) and to send that list to others.<p>I guess the point of this post is two-fold:<p>1. What does HN think about Google aggressively deranking people due to one simple mistake? Could others share their stories?<p>2. Is there anything I can do to get back my original traffic without removing this post? Should I remove the links and just keep the text citation? Did I fuck up permanently, with Google flagging my site or something?<p>Appreciate any input.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.xa0.de&#x2F;post&#x2F;List-of-QUBO-formulations&#x2F;",
