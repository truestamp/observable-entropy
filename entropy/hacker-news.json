      "text": "Hey there,<p>First time posting on HN. We&#x27;re looking for feedback from parents.<p>We&#x27;re 2 dads who started working on Dadditude in the midst of covid lockdowns last year.<p>Being a dad is a long, emotional, draining, and lonely journey. Through our research we learned that dads want to improve their parenting but are too shy to ask for help, and are tired of reading content online written for mums. We set out to fix that and create a platform that would help dads feel seen, validated, and supported.\nBy helping dads, we hope to support moms and partners too, because all parents deserve more support.<p>Quick timeline so far:\nWe started a community of dads on Instagram last Feb to test hypothesis and learn about their needs. We then launched an MVP in April, a super simple app serving weekly coaching guides created with a parenting professional partner.\nWe made several updates in summer and fall, working like crazy in the background to convince parenting professionals to write coaching guides for us. Especially hard when you&#x27;re a nobody. But people are kind and we found all the support we needed.\nWe launched a v1 app mid-December with 50 coaching guides and a more full fledge community board (and a paid membership tier).\nWe&#x27;ve just added on-demand parenting professional support in Jan.\nAnd last week added a picture board for dads to upload pics of their families, and that&#x27;s become more popular than the forums!! ← I knew dads wanted to feel more visible but  I love these discoveries!<p>Super proud of the work done so far, but still so much to do to smooth out the product experience, and get closer to PFM. So much learning.<p>web: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dadditude.app\nios: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1558653576\nandroid: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.dadditude.app<p>(part of the experience is behind a paywall, but you can test nearly all paid features once for free - so long as you register through Apple or Google)<p>All thoughts and feedback welcome in the comments below, especially if you&#x27;re a parent entrepreneur.
