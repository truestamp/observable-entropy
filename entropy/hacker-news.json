      "text": "Web services and sites really should stop using dark theme forcefully matching it to a browser or system dark UI theme. Users often use dark theme to distinguish UI from content, not blend content with UI. Properly speaking it&#x27;s not very user and eye friendly to read for long white text on a dark background. Sites that automatically force a dark theme on visitors remind me of a noob user that learn a new colorful style trick in Word processor who starts applying it in every document.<p>It&#x27;s good if a site offers dark theme option via some kind of switch but forcing it on visitors is not the brightest decision. More and more I notice that sites do that. And often they even don&#x27;t offer option to switch the site to a light theme. They just use a browser&#x27;s UI theme as a guide. It requires to switch a browser to a light one for such sites to use light theme.<p>Dark UI is to distinguish from, not to blend with content.",
