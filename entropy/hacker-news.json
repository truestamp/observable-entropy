I know that people will be extremely opinionated, but was just curious what people thought on rolling your own full website versus using some CRM to manage content.<p>Any suggestions or advice welcome? \nOr even opinions on tech stack?<p>Fwiw I was thinking React, with some bucket based serving for heavier objects, and maybe some scripted CRM that I’d make",
