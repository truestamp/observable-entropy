      "text": "We have IoT sensor data currently flowing Device → Telegraf → InfluxDB → Grafana (TIG stack). This is fine for simple queries and visualization. We want to keep using Grafana, but I&#x27;m looking to move to a more proper data infrastructure for 1) SQL-based analytics and ML applications, 2) pub-sub e.g. MQTT (to decouple sources from sinks), 3) long-term storage.<p>We&#x27;re talking on the order of dozens&#x2F;hundreds of devices posting data every min or so, not petabytes.<p>Should I be following a data lake architecture and doing MQTT → S3 &#x2F; Redshift → ??? → PostgreSQL → Grafana? That seems like a lot of work &#x2F; maintenance cost &#x2F; overkill (?).<p>Or just write a MQTT → PostgreSQL bridge? Why isn&#x27;t there an off-the-shelf solution, or am I missing something? I feel like this must be a common scenario?<p>Or should I be looking more closely at enterprise solutions e.g. Snowflake?<p>Known constraints:\n• Grafana supports PostgreSQL as a data source (but not Amazon Redshift).\n• Kinesis Firehose supports S3 and Redshift as destinations (but not RDS &#x2F; PostgreSQL).\n• Telegraf doesn&#x27;t (officially) support PostgreSQL as an output.<p>Bottom line: I am not a data engineer and want to avoid being one :)",
