      "text": "Hey there HN!<p>Who: We&#x27;re a small team of designers and developers based in India, that decided to get together a few months ago and hack together a fun privacy focussed utility app.<p>What: www.jaadoo.ai - A privacy focussed way to search and manage your mobile screenshots. Our beta is available for both iOS and Android. For this version (which we are calling - P.C. Sorkar, as an ode to one of India&#x27;s OG magicians) you can search mobile screenshots, tag them, delete them and share them. The app is free for upto 200 of your latest screenshots.<p>Ask: What can we do better? What features would you like to see on the next release?<p>Much love, Team Jaadoo.",
