      "text": "Background: I have a PhD in physics and moved to IT ~30 years ago. I am passionate with technology, code open-source for pleasure and am generally a nerd.<p>Since I read technical stuff all the time, I gave up on fiction years ago and now would like to come back to that, but I have no idea where to look for the kind of books I like.<p>I am looking for adventure stories, with technology and science, happening in the past or contemporary. I am not really into science fiction, but why not if there is a link to our world.<p>Science can be somehow off, I am not looking for a reference book :)<p>Maybe something like Dan Brown books, but with a technology and science that remotely makes sense?<p>Are there authors or titles you wild recommend I try?",
