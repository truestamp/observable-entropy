      "text": "Back in 2018 I started a Website together with two friends. It&#x27;s a platform for people to create desktop wallpapers – I will not share the URL here. It&#x27;s based on a feature that was introduced in a major OS back then and I think we still are the only online tool to make use of that feature. The platform is rather successful in terms of users&#x2F;wallpapers&#x2F;clicks but last year we needed to implement ads – a step which we tried to prevent from the beginning. It was necessary as the expenses went up quite a lot.\nWe are now living in different cities (different countries even), the website needs a constantly running mac server (which fails often, very often) and we are all pretty busy with other projects.<p>We agreed to try to sell it and we asked ourselves how selling something like a website would go about?<p>Where would you find possible buyers?<p>What data is important to share?<p>Do we share our code for review?",
