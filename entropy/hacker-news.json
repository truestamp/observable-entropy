      "text": "Is it worth investing in a vpn business nowadays? I doubt it would be very profitable. Maybe if it were 5–10 years ago and you were getting in the business while it was young, sure it could’ve been a great opportunity. But today there are hundreds of different VPN providers, and very few are well known today. Unless you could get a ton of funding and then provide something much better than other providers, you can’t really compete with paid VPNs.\nWhat do you guys say?",
