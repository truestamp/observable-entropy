I now face weeks of typing with a single hand.<p>You&#x27;d assume removing one hand would mean you&#x27;d type at half the rate, but I&#x27;m finding I&#x27;m typing at maybe a quarter as quickly or slower.<p>I&#x27;m dreading this coming period of my life, but it could be worse, so I&#x27;m staying positive. At any rate, I&#x27;d appreciate help.<p>Has anyone here gone through a similar experience? Do you have advice &#x2F; tips &#x2F; received wisdom that I might benefit from?",
