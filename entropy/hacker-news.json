      "text": "With every major release of Windows, MS seems to just add a new UI design language to the previous ones, making Windows ever more cluttered and inconsistent.<p>With Win11, there was room for MS to finally get rid of legacy designs that have plagued Windows for over 2 decades!! But unfortunately, Win11 is just a new skin on top of a pile of inconsistent design languages from before. Sure, there are improvements to the desktop and the settings app, but anything more serious and you&#x27;re faced with windows dating back to Windows 95&#x2F;98.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem like a problem that MS would be unaware of. But as much as I&#x27;d like to justify their actions by assuming that they still follow their backward compatibility philosophy, they have long crossed the line. Win11 design looks like a slap in the face of the customer. At the same time, MS could easily afford to hire better designers (which I think is not the main problem) or invest in consistent design across their Windows products, and yet they&#x27;re not doing that.<p>I&#x27;m happy that many are now switching to Linux just because the alternative (Win11) sucks so much. But frankly, I wish MS would fix this decades-old mess asap.",
