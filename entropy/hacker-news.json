      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working as a software developer for about 5 years, starting right out of college. The most recent two years were with a FAANG company. I did well there, and I mostly enjoyed the work, until around March 2019, when covid hit and we were sent home. About six months ago, the burnout got intense enough that I decided to just leave the company and take an indefinite break from working.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve been spending a decent amount of my time working on my own software passion projects, as well as doing semi-regular leetcode&#x2F;hackerrank problems to stay on my toes.<p>I now feel I&#x27;m ready to get back into the grind again, but am worried about having a ~6 month gap in my resume. I&#x27;m wondering, for people who might have related experience as an interviewee or interviewer, should I be worried about that gap? If so, is burnout an acceptable excuse for such a gap? I really believe it&#x27;s done wonders for my mental health, but I&#x27;m concerned it might make me appear to be a lesser candidate.",
