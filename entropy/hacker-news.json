      "text": "I&#x27;m a programmer that&#x27;s mostly worked with Python so far in my career. At various points, I&#x27;ve run into performance bottlenecks that others have solved by writing high-performance libraries in C++ and Rust, mainly for things like data iterators and network servers.<p>What are some good resources to learn how to write high-performance and low-latency code that can interface with popular languages like Python in 2022? There are a lot of open-source libraries I can analyze and study, but often I feel like the techniques and optimizations they use go way over my head.",
