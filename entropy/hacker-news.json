      "text": "We run big integration tests that stand up multiple services (Postgres, etc.) plus our own code in a Kubernetes cluster, then run lots of tests on them. Some of tests are stress tests that put a bunch of load on them, some are benchmarks, and some are pure integration tests.<p>We currently use Argo Workflows (to express the pipelines) plus Argo Events (to start automatic tests on GitHub webhooks), which allows us control over the Kubernetes aspect, but it is a mess of YAML, and it requires us to first put the workflows into Kubernetes as &quot;workflow templates&quot; that are then executed to generate the running &quot;workflows&quot;. Argo is also quite flaky and buggy. I&#x27;ve been thinking of using Jsonnet to make this less of a mess, but that doesn&#x27;t solve all the complaints.<p>We also use CircleCI for some stuff, but it&#x27;s much too limited; no support for running multiple nodes, for example. We&#x27;ve decided to just use it for normal building, unit tests, and linting.",
