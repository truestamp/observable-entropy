      "text": "I have some non-technical relatives in Russia, and they have started to feel the need to use a VPN for their average internet activities. Is there any recommended company to get a subscription from? I assume the sanctions will be a limiting factor in terms of variety and quality. Or is it better that I, as an outsider, pay the subscription and they just start using it from Russia? I hope we can keep the conversation non-political because I just want to help my relatives remain as free and informed as possible, despite the situation.<p>So, which VPN provider should one use from Russia?",
