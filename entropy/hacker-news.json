It&#x27;s kind of like a mix of pocket + kindle + anki.<p>It lets you \n=&gt; add add epubs, pdfs, and web articles to the app\n=&gt; highlight and add comments\n=&gt; tag and organize highlights\n=&gt; review them with a spaced repetition system<p>Today I made the decision to open source the project. I&#x27;m passionate about helping other people learn to learn better and hope that this will allow a lot more innovation in the tool and the space.<p>I&#x27;m very new to open source and development in general really, but looking forward to receiving the guidance of the community.",
