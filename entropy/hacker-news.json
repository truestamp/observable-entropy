      "text": "I am a strong believer in solo Brainstorming (team brainstorming too, but that&#x27;s another story).<p>I use a giant whiteboard while offline, or a hipster PDA when on the road.  I looked at Brainstorming apps and all I see is  mindmapping app, and while I also likke mindmapping it&#x27;s not brainstorming. Sorry.<p>Back in my days of iPad I used Notability and it was great, but now I don&#x27;t want yet another device (iPad) in order to use 1 app (Notability).<p>I am using Google Docs now (and some Google sheets), but is there a bette Brainstorming app out there? Or a Notability alternative for Android?",
