But before I jump into the rabbit hole, I want to ask for your kind advice.<p>What is your mental framework to deal with such a problem?<p>FYI, my app:<p>- is built with NodeJS\n- ran on a cloud server with 2 core CPU, 2G Ram, and 1M bandwidth\n- is a CRUD app<p>I have learned about building apps from the web, mostly from Udemy and Youtube. Someone has told me to not worry about performance. `Make it work, then make it better`.<p>Now that I have learned how to make it work, how can I learn how to make it better? Do you have any links or materials to share?<p>Thanks a lot.",
