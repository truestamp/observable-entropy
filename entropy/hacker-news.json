      "text": "Hello HNers! We&#x27;ve just launched an interactive reporting tool (it&#x27;s a map) that showcases the 13,000 reef and coral images people took as part of last year&#x27;s Great Reef Census. In addition, it details a number of key metrics for 5,000 reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, including an importance score that was derived from the 2020 survey data (I can provide more info on this).<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greatreefcensus.org&#x2F;detailed-reporting (try searching for &quot;Five Reefs&quot;)<p>More importantly it&#x27;s powered by our also-just-launched data API (just a firebase database, but carefully structured so as to be <i>most</i> useful ... for building something like our map). It was actually a super fun experience putting together the API documentation and examples ... which led to many iterations on the API structure itself. Keen to hear any thoughts and feedback on the links. Both are being actively developed in-house at our small non-profit here on the Great Barrier Reef. Cheers!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greatreefcensus.org&#x2F;api<p>As an aside, this year&#x27;s Census launched today. The plan is to have new survey data updated live on the API &#x2F; map (coming soon!).",
