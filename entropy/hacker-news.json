      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I’m Robbert, the creator of DataGridXL.js. After 1,5 years of hard work I have just released version 2.<p>DataGridXL is a free (and commercial) editable data table library written in ES6.<p>My goal is to develop the most performant &amp; user-friendly spreadsheet-like data table out there:<p>- It has zero dependencies. You don’t need any framework to use DataGridXL.\n- It is lightweight (~250kb) and easy to use. It does not even require messing with CSS.\n- It has its own Virtual DOM implementation to prevent DOM errors.\n- Developer friendly. Supports all modern web browsers<p>Please take a look at the performance demo (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;demos&#x2F;one-million-cells\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datagridxl.com&#x2F;demos&#x2F;one-million-cells</a>) to see the difference with other data grids out there. And let us know if you have any suggestions.<p>What&#x27;s new in version 2:<p>* Rapidly search cells via top bar, just like Google Sheets.\n* Freeze any amount of rows and&#x2F;or columns.\n* Hide and unhide rows and&#x2F;or columns, just like in Google Sheets.\n* Multi-Range Selection\n* Fullscreen Mode\n* Input bar at the bottom, so it works on touch devices too.<p>DataGridXL on Github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DataGridXL&#x2F;DataGridXL2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;DataGridXL&#x2F;DataGridXL2</a>\nDataGridXL on NPM: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;@datagridxl&#x2F;datagridxl2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;@datagridxl&#x2F;datagridxl2</a>\nDataGridXL Docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datagridxl.com&#x2F;docs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datagridxl.com&#x2F;docs</a><p>Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments!",

      "text": "My company builds on top of the Google Ads API. We are having serious issues with the iteration speed of the API and the aggressive deprecation and sunset schedule. Every few months we get emails warning us that the version of the API that we are currently using is going to sunset shortly and we need to migrate to the latest version. For example we are currently on V9 of the API. We migrated to it almost as soon as it was released on November 3, 2021. The sunset date for this version of the API is February 9, 2022. This is a grand total of 3 months and 6 days between release and sunset.<p>Three months between release of an API version and sunset is insane to me. Luckily we are an agile startup and can switch to a new API version fairly quickly (when there aren&#x27;t breaking changes, which sometimes there are). I have no idea how a bigger company who has to go through layers of QA, release planning, and red tape could possibly keep up. By the time you develop and launch support for a new version of the API you would literally have to start all over and work on upgrading to the next version.<p>You can see the release and sunset schedule on this page of the docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;google-ads&#x2F;api&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sunset-dates<p>Here are a few of the release schedules:<p>Version: V7 \nRelease Date: April 28, 2021 \nSunset Date: September 8, 2021<p>Version: V8\nRelease Date: June 9, 2021\nSunset Date: November 3, 2021<p>Version: V9\nRelease Date: November 3, 2021\nSunset Date: February 9, 2022",
