I often forget what I was talking about mid-sentence and find myself digressing.<p>2. I often feel pressure to be eloquent with word choice, and I can see my brain going haywire trying to sort an array of adjectives in my head to find the right words… but the end result is a bunch of confused faces. In other words, I think people think I’m BS’ing, and in a way, I am.<p>As you age, do you find it harder to decode thoughts -&gt; encode in brain -&gt; decode using speech?  Is this something I should get checked out?",
