Some questions are drafted by me and some submitted by users.\nfor some premium questions there&#x27;s a small fee that gives you access for a few months. \ni am starving for ideas on how to promote the site and increase it&#x27;s reach. The content is good (i believe), i also have heard some good reviews from people saying that the practice questions helped them succeed in the exam.\nAny ideas are welcome.. also if anybody wants to get involved to help&#x2F;grow the site, please reach out to me.",
