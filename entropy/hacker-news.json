      "text": "I graduated in a CS-related field about a year ago and have been working in a  non-IT role as a consultant&#x2F;project manager on digital transformation projects. What sounded like an exciting topic to work on for past me turned out to be an endless journey of crafting powerpoint presentations and fighting corporate bureaucracy (and loosing!). It has now come to the point where I hate standing up in the morning and going to work because I know that I will spend the majority of my day on things I would consider to be meaningless by any scale.<p>Last week I happened to find a Golang book I got as a present a few years ago and decided to work through it. While doing so I re-discovered much of the joy I had when working on programming related projects back in university. I am now at the point where I am considering working further to be able to switch my career at some point.<p>Problem is, I am pretty much locked in my current job. I moved places, my partner switched companies and I have other financial obligations that don&#x27;t allow me to sacrifice signifiant amounts of my salary. The city I live in also does not have a lot of other potential companies to work for. The remote alternatives I found are either US only (I&#x27;m in Germany) or require 1-2 years of relevant experience which I obviously don&#x27;t have.<p>This leaves me wondering, are there any good alternatives to gather the relevant experience that are also respected by employers or am I really out of luck here?",
