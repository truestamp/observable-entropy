I don&#x27;t have the time to counter-proof every single fallacy.<p>I observed that all these people frequently get new posts and even longer videos. They use these to let me &#x27;understand&#x27; their point of view. Watching these videos to have a basis to discuss on is time consuming, too. There are fewer videos to counter these - and in my experience just sending back counter videos does not help to convince them.<p>Have you experienced similar problems? Did you find a practical solution for your situation?",
