      "text": "The last time I got straight A’s was middle school. After high school I took a few years to work&#x2F;travel&#x2F; figure out what I like…as I wasn’t finding it in school. I’ve found an interest-more so  a passion-in technology. I like writing code, I like solving problems, and knowing how things work. I’ve had trouble however finding employment in the industry without a degree…I know this is not many peoples experience but it has been mine. Therefore, I’ve starting going back to school. But I just can’t seem to hack it. I think it’s poor time Managment and general apathy. When implementing something in code I find interesting for example, I’m able to spend 16&#x2F;hours a day every day until it’s complete. I’m not very good at pushing myself to finish things I don’t care about. I have pretty bad adhd, but my focusing problems really aren’t a limiting factor to success. I’m failing my very into level prereqs and other classes and I don’t know how to push past this. I don’t know anyone in my life personally in a similar situation to mine. So I’m wondering if anyone here has had any sort of similar experience, and how they were able to solve it?",
