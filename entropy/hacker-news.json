      "text": "Hi everyone.<p>I&#x27;m pretty confident that I have created the best placeholder service ever.\nHope you like it.<p>Finding Image placeholders was a problem for me. Used to search google for images which was kind of tedious. I tried using non-copyright image providers like Unsplash but that meant going to and fro a website constantly. This was starting to be annoying as I was constantly distracted and had to leave my coding environment.<p>Thus we decided to make our own placeholder service which is super easy to use (really easy) and gives quality images without ever leaving my code editor.<p>Hence imgsrc.space was born.\nTo me, it is possibly the best placeholder service ever. let me tell you what it can do.<p>Just name your search term, and we would find you the perfect image for it.\nResize Images on the fly, enter your desired dimensions and we would give you the resized image instantly.\nNot just images, you can also get Video placeholders on-demand, just name your search term.\nWe have a cool js library that makes your dev process even easier.\nYou would never need to leave your development environment to look for placeholders.\nNot only that you can use this to get photos and videos in &quot;codepen&quot;, &quot;js fiddle&quot; and similar services.\nYou can use it to write blog posts and video tutorials without worrying about hosting images that your viewers can follow.\nWe have a library of around 3Million+ Images and videos, so you can get creative with what you want.\nWant to try some images? Here try some.\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgsrc.space&#x2F;cat\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgsrc.space&#x2F;dog\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgsrc.space&#x2F;ocean<p>some resized images\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgsrc.space&#x2F;horse?h=200<p>Check out a video\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgsrc.space&#x2F;dog-v<p>I hope this would save some development time for you guys.
