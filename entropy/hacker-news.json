      "text": "The majority of our online interactions with companies &#x2F; institutions reduce to\nus filling out and posting forms. This is much better than doing the same thing\nwith paper or email. But it can&#x27;t be that way forever. Especially as the\nvolume of data increases, types of data become more varied, and frequency of\nsuch interactions increases.<p>My vision for how it should be is more like payments. I give the company &#x2F;\ninstitution my card details, and they transact against it to get what they need.\nThis transaction is facilitated by a clever broker company (i.e. the company I\nwant to build) who knows how to fetch the data from me - but doesn&#x27;t own or\ncontrol said data - at some small latency.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t the VISA &#x2F; MasterCard of personal data transactions exist yet? Is\nanyone working on this? Does anyone want to?<p>I get that this sounds a bit crazy right now, but I think this is a huge\nbusiness in the next decade.",
