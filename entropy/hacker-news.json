      "text": "I know it&#x27;s been discussed ad nauseam over the years but USB-C has been driving me crazy:<p>- Not knowing the capabilities of any port or device. Reminds me of the Plug and Play days: &quot;well let&#x27;s plug it in and see what happens&quot;.<p>- Power delivery? Passthrough? Good luck finding the magical combination of supported devices, wattage, etc. Even when I thought I found the right one my laptop would occasionally end up in some weird state between discharging and charging - taking power but not acknowledging it in software and slowly discharging but not as much without power...<p>- Display Port alt-mode. Where do I even start... Some cables mostly work but running two 4k displays reliably at 60Hz seems to be near impossible. Occasionally a display drops completely and there&#x27;s some sort of strange reboot&#x2F;shut down&#x2F;kill power to everything combination I haven&#x27;t quite figured out yet. They randomly drop from 60Hz to 30Hz or don&#x27;t initialize at 60Hz. Then some cables don&#x27;t support DPMS, DDC, who knows what else.<p>It seems that with high speed (10gbit or so from what I recall) via USB A, extremely capable HDMI, and dedicated charging ports prior to USB-C that was the epitome of connectivity, function, and reliability.<p>Initially I attributed all of this to the inevitable quirks of any new technology but after several years it seems as though these issues (and more) may never get sorted out.<p>What am I missing?",
