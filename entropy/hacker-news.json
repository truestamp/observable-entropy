      "text": "I often reflect back on a memorable story that my professor told during a course on experimental psychology. It went like this:<p>A researcher was studying fleas by doing some experimentation on them. He would pull a leg off the flea and say &quot;jump flea, jump!&quot; and the flea would jump. He then would pull another leg off the flea and say &quot;jump flea, jump!&quot; and the flea would jump. Finally, after pulling off all the legs off the flea, the researcher said  &quot;jump flea, jump!&quot; But the flea did not jump. The researcher concluded that when you pull all the legs off a flea, the flea goes deaf.<p>The moral of the story is that correlation does not imply causation.<p>Do others have memorable stories that they like that encapsulate powerful ideas?",
