      "text": "hi there, so i just need some quick opinion.<p>my co-founder is a very good performance marketer and makes a good six figure monthly income, and we are working on this new project that can be very big and is an amazing idea in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;m currently getting a &#x27;salary&#x27; to manage some devs and designers and i hate it that everything is coming out of his pocket, and i&#x27;d much rather find investors so that we can scale and make it happen quickly.<p>I am trying to get the most done in a cheaper way possible because i came in, he already spent 5 figures on something that was completely thrown away since it was useless.<p>What would you guys recommend me? i even mentioned that i got friends who would easily invest 500k+ in 8-12% however his reply are &#x27;no way this is my baby&#x27; and things of such.<p>right now he is trying to get a domain purchased for less than 10k, and i was like, dude if we got an investment we could have this domain already for 15k and we good. so domain, me not hiring more people, all this stuff it feels like we are limiting ourselves, or perhaps i should say fuck it and care less of his money. Is just that i know he wants to save money as well, and he is also a friend.<p>anyways, thanks in advance for any replies. hope all you guys are kicking ass this year as well ;)",
