Being documentation, ergonomics, bugs, you name it.<p>Open source alternatives are much better than proprietary closed source ones. Mind you that I&#x27;m not talking about code quality, I&#x27;m talking about mere usability and dev experience.<p>This is consistent across quite a few medium, large and very large companies (enterprises) I&#x27;ve been. Worst case (and quite common) is when a company &quot;builds&quot; upon OS (e.g. a framework based on Flask). The end result is a painful to work with half-baked mess.<p>What I don&#x27;t get though is that OS is built (in many cases) by hobbyists for free. The internal messes are always being built by people on a steady payroll. I just don&#x27;t get it...",
