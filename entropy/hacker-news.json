      "text": "I have been looking to use lipsync for a project at work, and I have been horrified to see that the most used deepfake library [0] with over 30k stars has the word &quot;test&quot; mentioned in it a whopping 10 times. This naturally made me very hesitant to use this library as who (I guess no one, really) knows how unstable it may be.<p>Are there any examples of projects in ML (other than libs like pytorch) that do have test suites, and perhaps even enforce TDD? Would be very curious to know.<p>[0] DeepFaceLab https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iperov&#x2F;DeepFaceLab",
