Really frustrating behavior like ignoring quoted strings, giving me results that omit the most important token for my search, etc.<p>I see tons of discussion on this and very few people mentioning the verbatim mode which completely fixes all of this toxic search behavior.<p>Among a tiny, informal survey of my nerdy&#x2F;developer&#x2F;tech friends literally none of them knew about this feature.<p>So based on the discussion happening now, and extrapolation, I am assuming most of HN also doesn&#x27;t know.<p>After you do a search, choose `Tools -&gt; All Results -&gt; Verbatim`.  This will give you the behavior that you used to get from google search.",
