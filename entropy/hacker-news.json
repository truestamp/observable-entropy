      "text": "One of the projects I work on has a Git Rebase workflow. Developers looking to get their changes into the main branch:<p>1. Do a rebase to get their branch in-sync with main, \n2. Squash their branch&#x27;s commits,\n3. Make a push&#x2F;force push to their branch, and\n4. Create a pull request.<p>Which is lovely, but the process has a gnarly learning curve for our junior devs.<p>Is anyone familiar with documentation or tooling that does a good job of streamlining this sort of workflow?",
