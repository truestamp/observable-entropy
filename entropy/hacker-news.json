      "text": "4 years ago I went through the interview process with Google. Fortunately I had the help of a lot of friends and after going through the interview process at Google I learned a few things.<p>1. The interview process is hard, but it&#x27;s a lot easier with the right support.<p>2. Google (and big-tech in general) are great places to work.<p>That&#x27;s why I started Coachable (formerly CodeBreakers) a company that makes jobs in big-tech accessible by providing 1-1 mentorship from FAANG-engineers for no upfront cost until hired. We believe that anyone that is &quot;Coachable&quot; deserves the opportunity to get a great job and we&#x27;re starting by focusing on big-tech.<p>Thought I&#x27;d reach out and answer any questions you have about software engineering in general, preparing for software engineering interviews, how to get a big-tech job, working at Google, running a bootstrapped company, or anything else interesting.<p>FAQ: Since this has been asked frequently in the past. There is no age, location, or CS background restriction for Coachable. We&#x27;re fully remote and all ages&#x2F;backgrounds are welcome and encouraged.<p>———————————————————————————————<p>Other Stuff:<p>APPLY: If you&#x27;re interested you can check out my program - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coachable.dev&#x2F;<p>WIN $200: Coachable Summer Cash Giveaway, open to .EDU emails: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sociali.io&#x2F;lp&#x2F;133505&#x2F;coachabledev1",

      "text": "Hey folks, Michael here.<p>I have been working in this project on and of for about a year and a half and I finally got it into a state where I can share it. I initially started this project to learn Rust and afterwards decided to make it useful for others.<p>Vulpo Auth is an authentication server that you can host yourself. The goal was to make it as easy as possible for you to get started and have a complete authentication solution without you having to configure anything. Project Website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth.vulpo.dev<p>The Project contains:\n  - Auth Server (Rust)\n  - Admin Dashboard\n  - JS and react SDK\n  - Prebuilt Web UI (currently react) (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth.vulpo.dev&#x2F;ui)\n  - rust SDK for rocket<p>Some of the features:\n  - Email and Password Auth\n  - Passwordless Auth\n  - Google Auth\n  - Translateable Email Templates\n  - Enable&#x2F;Disable Sign In or Sign Up\n  - Password Reset Flow\n  - Update Email Flow<p>There is still a lot to do, the code base is full of experimental ideas and there a bunch of things to clean up, but first I want to focus on writing documentation and guides before adding more features.<p>Besides the missing documentation, what are you missing?",
