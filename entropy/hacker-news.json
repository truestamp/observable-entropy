      "text": "Hi HN! A friend and I recently founded a startup with an MVP already in the barrel. We&#x27;re wondering if anyone has a SaaS product that can be used for multiple customer-facing functions, namely discovery, support and outreach. We&#x27;re trying to find something that would allow us to build profiles for our prospective customers such that their entire interaction history with our company is centralized in one place (e.g., information about potential customers discovered during initial conversations, should they become a user any support tickets they create&#x2F;interact with, and any proactive outreach we might do, like marketing emails we send).<p>Has anyone run across such a tool? Anyone building this?<p>If not, what tool(s) are you using to accomplish these functions?",
