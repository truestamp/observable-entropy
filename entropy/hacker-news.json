      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I’m cofounder of <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vantage.sh&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vantage.sh&#x2F;</a> - I previously worked at AWS and DigitalOcean.<p>Today Vantage is launching Autopilot: a managed service that identifies and applies savings to your AWS account by automating the buying and selling of reserved instances. This is saving early customers over 50% in some cases. Upon opting into Autopilot, if your on-demand EC2 costs increase, Vantage purchases 3 year, no-upfront reserved instances. In the event your compute spend decreases, Autopilot will list your reserved instances for sale in the AWS EC2 Reserved Instance marketplace on your behalf.<p>Unlike other providers that charge you egregious fees (20% or more), Autopilot only charges you 5% of the savings found. These are your cost savings and I believe you should have as much of the benefit as possible.<p>Some of our current customers include Barstool Sports, PlanetScale, Panther, and MIT.<p>Happy to answer any questions or feel free to contact me at ben [at] vantage [dot] sh if I can be helpful.",
