I recall some older websites and articles written by founders who had set up scalable self-managed hosting solutions for their businesses, but I’d be darned if I couldn’t find them. If anyone has an inkling of what ever the hell I’m talking about, or has a line on any other nice resources that would be stellar. Thanks!",
