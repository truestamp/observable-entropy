      "text": "My little daughter started drawing blackholes and asking about them, whether these are doors to other dimensions, and so on. When I was a kid I got fascinated by the concept of these &quot;gravity wells&quot;, from a 1984&#x27;s encyclopedia and Disney&#x27;s black hole movie with AI and all. Even designed a spaceship inside an asteroid to withstand the travel. Now I know the topic is more complex than that, but I&#x27;m looking for kids oriented literature on BH, gravitational waves, etc. &quot;The Science of Interstellar&quot; looks good for her age due to the visuals.",
