      "text": "This tweet (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;gossipbabies&#x2F;status&#x2F;1487161069143576576) resonated with me and I wonder how common my experience is. Working at smallish web software companies over the past few years I have observed a trend toward increasingly many specialized SaaS products for stuff that might previously have been handled by (for example) emails, spreadsheets and documents.<p>Are you seeing this as well? What kinds of systemic issues do you think might arise from this sort of change? Have you, or your organizations, evolved any strategies for balancing operational complexity and information siloing against the perceived benefits of this kind of SaaS specialization?",
