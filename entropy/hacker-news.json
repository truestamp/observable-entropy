      "text": "I am trying to develop a simple web and mobile native app as a learning exercise. To support both web and native mobile app I am thinking of this broad backend architecture:<p><pre><code>    DB &lt;--&gt; common internal api &lt;-----&gt; web request&#x2F;response handler &lt;---&gt; web client\n                             ^\n                             |\n                             +--------&gt; REST API &lt;----&gt; native mobile app\n\n</code></pre>\nMy questions are:<p>0. Is this design to support both web clients and native mobile apps okay? Is there a better approach? I am trying to develop simple old-fashioned GET&#x2F;POST and server-side rendered web app(i.e. not an SPA), but also want to support native mobile app.<p>1. When the browser sends a request to the backend, or receives a response from the backend, some of the important communication aspects such as TLS, cookie management, form data packing etc is handled by the browser on the client-side. How is this achieved on a native mobile app? Are there native libraries that handle this on behalf of the app? I do not want to use webview to wrap the web client on mobile devices.",
