      "text": "Hey HN Community!<p>We built this simple community search tool that basically allows people to search through thousands of past Reddit threads and tens of thousands of recommendations using tags. It mostly covers a few bigger subreddits like r&#x2F;BIFL, r&#x2F;MFA, r&#x2F;AskMen, r&#x2F;SkincareAddiction but along the way, I expanded it to include other smaller subreddits too. In addition to filtering by category, power users can also search by<p>-Body Fit (big thigh, long torso)<p>-Occupation (work in retail, teacher, doctor)<p>-Age (18-24, 25-35), Size (height, weight)<p>-Brand comparison (similar to: X)<p>-Use (suitable for wedding, everyday wear)<p>-Location (available in UK, use in Northeast US)<p>-Mood&#x2F;Style (minimalist, vintage, retro)<p>Check it out. Buy fewer, buy better. Happy Earth Day!",
