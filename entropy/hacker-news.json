      "text": "Let me first say, I do get why ICANN has been successful in their ability to manage and administer their business (and to a lesser extent, duty) of being the authority in domains and domain name resolution.<p>But if all of this is built off of free and open protocols, why would I pay a company for the right to administer something I can do for free? Am I off base in my understanding of how the internet works, given not having to pay thousands of dollars to have the right to a custom name server?<p>If anyone can give me a technical explanation why it’s impossible to host your own nameservers or have your own custom domain, I’m genuinely curious.<p>It just feels like with the undercurrent of some in tech to get back to a more decentralized experience on the web, more would be done to allow for people to do what they want with the technology they have access to.",
