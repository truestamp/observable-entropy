      "text": "Inspired by this comment: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27859607<p>I&#x27;m worried that binary thinking between free market for-profits solving a challenge v. compelling government regulation is keeping us blinded to other potential solutions, but I&#x27;m having a hard time thinking of what solutions exist to incentivize &quot;investment&quot; in non-profits. I put &quot;investment&quot; in quotes because I&#x27;m not aware of how returns could be structured while maintaining any form of non-profit status given that the returns would likely be profits anyway, but I admit this is far out of my depth.<p>Basically, is it even possible to &quot;invest&quot; in a non-profit and see upside without violating the very concept of a non-profit? Do such structures exist? If not, how might such a thing look?",
