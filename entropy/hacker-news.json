Ultimately, we hope climbers find the Wiki site useful, and stick around to help us improve the climbing route database, which, by the way, is freely available under the public domain license.<p>Would you upload photos of a rock wall and let others freely use your photos in anyway they wish (including commercial purposes)?<p>If you&#x27;re active on GitHub, please share your feedback on RFC 307: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenBeta&#x2F;open-tacos&#x2F;issues&#x2F;307<p>thank you!",
