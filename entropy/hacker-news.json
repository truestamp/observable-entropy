What workstation are you using? What IDE? What kind of software are you running locally? Is it even necessary to have all developers working with containers locally?<p>We are going to be using OpenShift and Podman.<p>I am part of the team leading the charge. We will eventually have to roll this out to a couple hundred developers and what to get an idea of what people are doing.<p>Thank you!",
