The original computer is long gone.<p>So I bought another mini tower of the same vintage, trying to recover, and received a message like &quot;these disks were not made on this machine&quot;<p>Compaq support was no help and MS support has an open ticket since Nov 2021.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at the disks on another machine and its unclear what&#x27;s going on. No info on the format, structure, etc appears in my web searches.<p>Does anyone know how to get to data off them and or someone or some place who does?<p>Thanks!",
