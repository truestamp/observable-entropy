      "text": "So I just got a gated &quot;tell us your age&quot; modal on Instagram, both web and in the app. Absolutely no way to get past it without entering my information.<p>The reason they give is &quot;we&#x27;ll show you better ads&quot;.<p>Tried to input that I&#x27;m 1, 2, 3... years of age (nearest options on the year selector).<p>It wouldn&#x27;t accept my age until I got up to 7. Then it let me submit and then locked my account.<p>Now I had to give them my ID or they will permanently disable my account in 30 days.<p>I am not a US citizen, I am an EU citizen. There is no reason they can require this information - happy to hear what type of GDPR or other request I can file to get them to remove my birth date and my ID which I just submitted.",
