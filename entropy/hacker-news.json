      "text": "Hello HN!<p>Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I&#x27;ve created a service that creates a &quot;flow map&quot; of your mobile app.<p>Link: prodscape.net<p>The hypotheses is that it will reduce last-minute regressions, promote holistic discussion, and help develop more ownership within an organization. This is something that I would have liked to have had when I was working at a big company.<p>Some caveats:\n* Only iOS is currently supported but Android-support will be coming soon.\n* You need a developer-signed IPA file (see the guide on creating an IPA file here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prodscape.net&#x2F;finding-ipa.html).<p>I would appreciate your thoughts on 1.) your barriers to trying it, 2.) your impressions of the map, 3.) whether you&#x27;re interested in applying this to your team, or 4.) anything else.<p>Don&#x27;t have access to an IPA file? Email me at support@prodscape.net and I will send you one to try.<p>Thanks!",
