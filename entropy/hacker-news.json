      "text": "Throwaway because I&#x27;m not brave enough to ask this on my main account. Also this may be more appropriate for &#x2F;r&#x2F;relationshipadvice but you&#x27;re my people, so here we are!<p>I (M&#x2F;40) have fallen for someone (F&#x2F;32) who&#x27;s very into spirituality, Law of Attraction, and related stuff. I&#x27;m a technical person, I&#x27;m very much aligned with evidence-based beliefs, atheist, and this is all very new to me. We are best friends, we will likely be no more than that (i.e. no relationship on the horizon), and I am 100% happy with that to be the case.<p>I would like to better understand some of her interests without being drawn into what I currently view as pseudoscience. I realise this might make me a bad person, but she makes me feel like nobody else I&#x27;ve ever met, and she&#x27;s so well-read on it all that I can&#x27;t quite make the jump to have her explain some of it to me as a skeptic…I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be going in unprepared if I don&#x27;t have at least a cursory understanding first.<p>Is there reading material you&#x27;d recommend for this? Is there any advice you&#x27;d give to someone who&#x27;s somewhat open-minded but doesn&#x27;t want to screw up a friendship by blundering in with the wrong thing?<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks for any advice.",
