      "text": "We&#x27;re a small company. We have several servers that we access through SSH. We like to centralize SSH access.<p>Current solutions we are aware of:<p>- Share the SSH keys, e.g. on a shared filesystem.\n- Distribute SSH public keys of users with Puppet, Ansible, etc.\n- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goteleport.com&#x2F; (a fancy bastion host)<p>What I&#x27;m looking for:<p>A tool, with which an employee requests access to a server and automatically gets a signed ssh key in return which has limited validity. This key is automatically loaded into the ssh-agent. Ideally, the &#x27;~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config&#x27; is adjusted, so that the correct username is used, and &#x27;~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;known_hosts&#x27; is updated with the server&#x27;s public key digest.<p>What I imagine from the perspective of the user:<p>- &#x27;tool auth&#x27;\n  &gt; Check if authenticated with the central key management server\n  &gt; Otherwise OAuth with my regular SSO (e.g. Google Workspace)\n- &#x27;tool ssh server0.corp.com&#x27;\n  &gt; Check with the central key management server if the user has permission to access server0.corp.com\n  &gt; If yes, issue a time-constrained certificate (or sign the user&#x27;s local public key, whatever)\n  &gt; Ensure that the server is configured correctly in &#x27;~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config&#x27;\n  &gt; Ensure that the server public key digest is in &#x27;~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;known_hosts&#x27;\n  &gt; Add the certificate to ssh-agent\n- Run the ssh-based command, e.g. &#x27;ssh server0.corp.com&#x27;, &#x27;scp local_file server0.corp.com:remote_file&#x27;, &#x27;ansible-playbook ...&#x27;, &#x27;git pull -pr&#x27; or whatever<p>Does such a system exist? Ideally something that is easy to deploy to a cloud if it would be self-hosted (and in the best case makes use of Azure KV, Google KMS, AWS KMS, Vault, ...) or that is hosted (i.e. offered as a service).<p>From the operator perspective, it should not take more than configuring the PKI in OpenSSH and&#x2F;or maybe install an agent on the server. (But it&#x27;d be great if that would not be necessary (as OpenSSH afaik can already handle PKI) and if the PKI-related tasks were handled through Ansible&#x2F;Puppet&#x2F;etc. or the &#x27;tool&#x27;.)",
