Especially when the title reflects some kind of progression (e.g. a data analyst changing their titles to data scientist because it will help them land a better job in the future).<p>My personal policy has been to always use the exact title the company uses, and then list responsibilities in the bullet points which hopefully explains any potential discrepancy between title and responsibilities.<p>Thoughts?",
