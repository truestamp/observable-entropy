      "text": "I&#x27;m sorry if this is not the right place to ask. I did not find any relevant subreddit on reddit to ask, so I came here.<p>I&#x27;m trying to follow some python tutorials on implementing a blockchain. I implemented the mining function, where it generates a hash based on previous hash, timestamp and some data. And this hash is verified by checking whether there are 4 zeros in the starting hash and is then added to an array called chain.<p>But, How does a server hosted somewhere on the cloud verifies this hash sent by a miner? should the server calculate the hash before the miner does and check whether they are equal?<p>Or will the server only checks for the starting zeros in the hash? In this case, miners can cheat right? just by sending a random string with 4 starting zeros?<p>Please enlighten me and explain me like I&#x27;m five. Thank you!",
