The app does not interact with the game&#x27;s source code in any way - it is entirely separate. I plan to monetize the app.<p>The game&#x27;s EULA forbids any derivative works. I&#x27;ve been googling a lot and it seems that some derivative works are considered &#x27;fair use&#x27; - for example, game-related content from creators on youtube and twitch. Is my app going to be considered &#x27;fair use&#x27; too?<p>Is there any copyright lawyer who could help me understand if my app is going to infringe the game&#x27;s copyright?<p>Thanks in advance!!!",
