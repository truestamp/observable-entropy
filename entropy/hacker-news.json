      "text": "Hi OSS Developers,\n  I hope that you can help me understand the state of OSS Monetization better. I’m interested if and how you monetize - or try to monetize - your projects.<p>To get a better picture of the current state of OSS monetization I’ve set-up a quick survey to evaluate different monetization approaches and what OSS developers would require to work full- or part-time on their OSS projects.<p>The survey with 16 questions will take about 5 minutes and is aimed at OSS developers &#x2F; maintainers:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLSegX_yKiGtXamKrVfg_1ioVWZ3Xdvtc3usZYn7p20dysHiaGQ&#x2F;viewform<p>Best regards,\nJoerg<p>PS: if you want to get the Survey Results you can join an email list at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailchi.mp&#x2F;8e59bb1c13db&#x2F;state-of-oss-monetization",

      "text": "eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel&#x2F;user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.<p>However, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier&#x2F;faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it&#x27;s quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.",
