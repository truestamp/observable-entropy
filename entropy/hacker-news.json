      "text": "If you didn’t check out webman a few weeks ago when I first posted about it, it’s gotten some serious upgrades!<p>We’ve received some great contributions from a couple super active members (thank you!) and now have automated schema linting &amp; installation testing for new package recipes, UI improvements, an interactive search command TUI to explore available packages, IDE package recipe autocompletion automatically with SchemaStore, lots of new packages, and support for installing package groups like modern-unix.<p>Webman is not trying to fill the same niche of homebrew; I think homebrew does a great job for Unix systems. However, Webman is built to be able to install on Windows too as a first-class citizen. It installs release binaries rather than building from source, which keeps package recipes lightweight &amp; lets us require no dependencies. Webman also makes it super easy to install and switch between different versions of software (similar to tools like nvm). I’ve been using it to manage different versions of Go, and it’s worked nicely!<p>If you find any packages you’d like that aren’t in the webman-pkgs repo yet, I’d love to help you out merging a PR! With the new schema support, it’s never been easier to write a package recipe, and CI will make sure your package installs correctly on each supported platform.<p>If you find the project interesting, give it a star! It means a lot :)<p>FYI: Webman is under active development so breaking changes may still occur. Don’t rely on this webman in production at least until a major release.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;candrewlee14&#x2F;webman",
