I love my PhD research topic, it&#x27;s challenging, fun and novel but I don&#x27;t see it being used for any practical applications. I teach basic compiler course part-time as an instructor at my university as well. I work full-time as a backend software engineer at Microsoft.<p>My goal is to actually use the concepts I spent so much to learn in my PhD in my career. Where should I start? What tool&#x2F;library&#x2F;framework is a must know for a compiler engineer? What are the companies that do exciting stuff in compilers?<p>I appreciate any help. Thank you",
