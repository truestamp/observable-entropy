      "text": "Musk not buying Twitter because of the apparent fake account ‘problem’ is absurd. Of course Twitter has fake accounts and automated bots that are hooked up to Twitter’s API and perform automated tweeting. You can even declare in Twitter’s settings that the account is automated and let followers know the account is automated.<p>Some amount of automation on Twitter is good. Troll farms spreading disinformation may be bad however, so I can see an issue with that, but come on, why did musk bail on the deal?",
