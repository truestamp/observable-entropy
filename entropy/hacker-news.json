      "text": "A group of my friends made this platform as part of a course we’re taking that teaches us about open source software development practices, and we would like to announce that we’ve finished its basic functionality.<p>We created this in response to the Rythm bot for Discord being shut down, and intend to have it so that you could use our API to stream files on a remote machine to multiple clients. We provided an example client as a Discord bot.<p>Demonstration video (apologies for the bad quality!): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1BElcWOi4bPMGhvmtrWqdAZ5P-9I80xB4&#x2F;view<p>We’re hoping to grow a community on this, since it’s great to have actual users and contributors (if possible!) We opened a few issues, and think it would be cool to see people eventually start making their own clients if they have preferences for audio streaming other than Discord voice channels!<p>Here’s the organization repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;raudio-project<p>Here’s the landing page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raudio-project.github.io&#x2F;<p>And the Discord server link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;invite&#x2F;FM78JTfU9X<p>Any and all feedback is appreciated! Also, please feel free to join the Discord and have a chat with us!",
