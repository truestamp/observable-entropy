      "text": "Hi,<p>In the past few years, I have discovered and tested the benefits of goal settings and visualization. I have formed this habit of writing my goals as affirmations in a pocket diary and reading it every morning. However, there are days when I forget to do it and then lose momentum.<p>So, I thought of a chrome extension with a minimal interface where I can add all my affirmations, and then it displays them on a new tab throughout the day, one affirmation at a time.<p>With the help of my teammate, I have created exactly this. It&#x27;s called &#x27;Affirmations Flow.&#x27;<p>This is how it works:<p>- When you add it to the chrome, it comes with a few sample affirmations preloaded\n- You can edit and replace them with your affirmations.\n- Click save, and you are set.\n- When you open a new tab next time, it will shuffle play those affirmations displaying each affirmation for thirty minutes so that you can focus on it.\n- If you are in public place and do not want others to see your affirmations, there is an option to hide the shuffle and the extension gives you a blank screen new tab with beautiful floating bubbles.<p>It&#x27;s totally free.<p>Here is the link if you want try it out:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;affirmations-flow&#x2F;koaaphllbjjlfgfmjohmlnncpeepdogg?hl=en",
