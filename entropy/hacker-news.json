Can be pro or personal. Feel free to share more than one, if you like.<p>I remember that I was pretty sad when Macromedia (later Adobe) Fireworks stopped being developed. I always liked it better than Ps. But that was &quot;a while&quot; ago and right now we have far better tools, like Figma.<p>Does our industry leave any space for tech-nostalgia at all? Or is the current toolstack just better in every respect?<p>Thanks for any comment. :-)",
