      "text": "Hello,<p>I ordered 2 pixel 6 pros from google store. This was on Dec 9th, 2021. The order was delivered on Dec 22nd. However, they only delivered 1 phone. But they claim that they delivered both phones.<p>I contacted support, and created a ticket on Dec 22nd (or Dec 23rd, I don&#x27;t recall). And since then, I keep receiving the same message from them:<p>&gt; Thanks for reaching out to the Google Support team.<p>&gt; Please accept my sincere apologies as it is taking more time than expected.<p>&gt; I can completely understand how inconvenient it is not to have your issue resolved soon. However, let me\nassure you that we&#x27;re trying our best to resolve it as soon as possible.<p>&gt; Furthermore, I&#x27;ve shared the details with our higher end support team. Rest assured, I&#x27;ll notify you as soon as\nthey reply.<p>&gt; I really appreciate your continued patience and cooperation as we work to resolve this situation.<p>Almost every other day, I receive a message like the above, that this info is shared with someone. I was told this ticket is escalated (twice now?). Nothing has moved forward. And it has been 3 weeks (and over a month since the transaction).<p>If this is the experience I have with an order, who know how it is if I need to invoke the warranty.<p>What should I do in this case? Is this a glimpse of how Google support in general is?",
