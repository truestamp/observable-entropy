As someone quite new in this area, and I know I&#x27;d run into some pro-readers here, what are the suggestions you have to a sci-fi writer?<p>Honestly, I will be touching on topics that I knew some might get offended. Examples being, if you guys recall Peter Thiel&#x27;s question on: What is the thing that you believe in but no one else does?<p>Well, I believe we are not all human.\nI know this is so, anti humanity, but theoretically speaking, if monkeys and human were of the same ancestor, then at one point up in the genetic tree, we were considered both monkeys. The divergence must&#x27;ve happened down the hill somewhere. So, in the eyes of those in the future, we may or may not remain human.<p>I fleshed out this debate in my book. Do you guys think I&#x27;m get in trouble for this?<p>AWK me",
