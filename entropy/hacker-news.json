      "text": "I stream most of my music, but I&#x27;ve got a collection of MP3s that I keep around and still listen to sometimes. So far I&#x27;ve been using TuneBox, an iOS app that hooks into your Dropbox and provides a media player interface over it. This is a great premise, and it mostly gets the job done, but it hasn&#x27;t been updated in several years and has some minor bugs&#x2F;annoyances.<p>Surely there&#x27;s still a decent, maintained iOS app for playing local music files? I&#x27;m willing to pay, and I&#x27;d even be fine without Dropbox integration; my collection doesn&#x27;t change very often. I&#x27;m just having trouble even finding an app that matches the original iPod app that used to exist on iPhones.<p>Any recommendations?",

Usually these come down to a feature either:<p>a) still in beta\nb) pushed by chrome so not a <i>real</i> standard\nc) is implemented but half-baked, doesn’t work, or stripped down for privacy concerns.<p>I think it would be helpful if, instead of arguing wether Safari’s gatekeeping is saving or stalling the web, we list out the things we can’t do that are <i>actual</i> standards and why.<p>Please be sure not to list anything coming to WebKit in iOS16 as it would lead to redundancy.",
