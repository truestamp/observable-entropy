      "text": "I&#x27;m currently refactoring my app away from websockets to a more traditional RESTful API (especially for things that should&#x27;ve been RESTful in the first place), and I wanted to know peoples&#x27; thoughts on whether response bodies should return just what you need (e.g. a need-to-know response), or return components that are common across different responses.<p>For example, given a hypothetical API, `GET &#x2F;widgets&#x2F;:id` would return a generic set of properties for the widget... the id, location, parts, etc.<p>Whereas `POST &#x2F;widgets` could return all of that, but in a scenario where it doesn&#x27;t matter (that is, all the other values are null or defaults), then returning just `{ id }` would be sufficient.<p>Especially in the case of large response payloads, it may save some data from going over the wire, but we may be waltzing into premature optimization territory here.<p>If you use reusable components in OpenAPI, then it indirectly pushes you towards having your API return common schemas across different routes. So both `POST &#x2F;widgets` and `GET &#x2F;widgets&#x2F;:id` would return the same kind of response (in terms of properties present, etc.)<p>I can also see the argument that for developer friendliness, it makes more sense to return the kitchen sink, so additional calls need not be made to retrieve additional information.<p>In the real world, Stripe&#x27;s API always returns a common object that you can rely on... creating an invoice returns an &quot;Invoice&quot; object, listing invoices returns an array of &quot;Invoice&quot; objects, updating an invoice returns an &quot;Invoice&quot; object, etc.<p>I ask this because I can see in the existing code that a lot of the calls were fairly minimalist in nature. For example, deleting a widget wouldn&#x27;t even _need_ a response body. A 200 would just mean I could remove the element from the DOM, but from a dev friendliness POV, it could be advantageous to return the output of `GET &#x2F;widgets` when you call `DELETE &#x2F;widgets&#x2F;:id` (or maybe the output of `GET &#x2F;widgets&#x2F;:id` with the deleted flag set)",
