      "text": "I&#x27;ve never asked for a raise in my life so I don&#x27;t know how to approach my boss on this. Quick summary of my situation:<p>Almsot two years ago I joined a startup as a remote Sr Engineer. The startup is the side company of a big company who wanted to sell a technological product &#x2F; service. I am hired by the big company but for the customers the startup is a new company.<p>I coded the MVP and then I created a small team (3 persons) which I lead curretnly. There is a PM who do some code to help us but I take all the tech decissions.<p>I have the same salary as two years ago, I have more responsabilities, and I receive offers from companies with a better salary on Linkedin on a weekly basis - but I don&#x27;t want to change jobs. I&#x27;d like to stay where I am with a better salary.<p>But I am not sure how to approach by boss about this. Should I ask for exactly the new amount I desire? Should I ask for a raise and let him make me an offer? Should I mention I receive offers from other companies?<p>Any help would be appreciated.",
