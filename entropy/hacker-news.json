      "text": "Occasionally I have friends who really want to get involved in software, but they have zero background in it whatsoever. I&#x27;m never really sure what to say. Computers and programming have been a part of my life as long as I can remember. It&#x27;s the only thing I was ever good at or wanted to do. I can&#x27;t really understand how to articulate that. It seems impossible for me to recommend someone do this stuff without having that lifelong level of understanding and context and passion. Am I wrong? Is software really not that hard, and able to be learned later in life?",
