IIRC it isn&#x27;t a remote friendly company, which I saw as a major con for SWE when I interviewed there awhile back. But I&#x27;m interested in hearing more about what people think of the company in general.",

I would have thought this would have improved a lot in the 10-15 years since I last looked at it seriously. I&#x27;m hoping some here know how this ought to be done on modern cloud services to enable delivering in-app videos cost effectively to large numbers of viewers. thanks!",
