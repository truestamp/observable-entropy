Each of our (siloed) clients will provide unique scheduling options to their customers, meaning that each of our clients requires different appointment types and availability configuration options.<p>Basically, we need to provide a Calendly-like platform to each of our clients. Are there any existing providers that are built for this?<p>Ideally we&#x27;d be interfacing with a simple API that handles all the hard parts of scheduling. Bonus points if the provider has some pre-built elements that make building client-facing availability configuration really easy.",
