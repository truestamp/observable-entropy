I&#x27;m in the process of opening an office, and I&#x27;m thinking of implementing the following rules:<p>1) No work hours. You can work whenever you want, for any period of time you want.<p>2) You can work from wherever you want. You can go full remote, come to the office daily, or anything in between.<p>3) You have to come to the office every Monday for an hour or 2 for a meeting. You choose to leave or stay after that.<p>What&#x27;s important is that you meet deadlines. Everyone has a specified set of tasks, so it would be very clear when someone is lagging behind.<p>The previous employee inside me is very excited about this system, but the manager in me feels that this is a naive approach. I fear that trying it out might make us miss some deadlines or produce low quality products, which would be a hit to our reputation.<p>Anyone has experience with working with such a system?",
