We also use confluence for tech documentation. \nOne challenge we face with google drive is organising documents and organic discovery. People dont create in designated folders. they create in their drive and share the URLs. It works but if the person leaves or if one has to find other documents in related area it becomes difficult.\nDoes your organisation faces this problem? If so, can you please share the techniques or tools you have used to solve this problem. thanks.",

Is there any canonical guide out there for choosing one, or even something that helps shed some context on why various versions exist?
