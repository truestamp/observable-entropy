      "text": "From the outside in, people think that I&#x27;ve got it going on. I grew up poor, and I was an awkward shy kid, and - a few decades later - by any measure I am living the American dream. With hard work I put myself through college at night, survived divorce, lay-off, and more.<p>When I was 18 almost as a joke I started a little FUN project that ended up as a mildly successful company with a small exit.  Then I follow the college-job route, here and there thinkering with entrepreneurship, but while I was not longer socially shy&#x2F;awkward my ventures often were relinquished to lists, or just acquiring a domain (at one point I owned &gt;200 domains), or building a sucky web site, or filing a provisional patent, but I was &quot;marketing shy&quot;, I never put myself out there, or at times I hid behind some excuse that I know now they were lame AF: &quot;I need 20 million dollars in VC to make it happen&quot;.<p>Plot twist, once I got a meeting with a VC I blew it off with an excuse.<p>Even at work as a VP I have the &quot;failure to launch&quot; syndrome, I promise projects and then I don&#x27;t follow through because I get stuck somewhere where my Anxiety cripples me (often when some deliverable involves managing other people).<p>Nobody believes me, not even my therapist. Let alone my dozens of ex-girlfirends; but here I am. Planing planning planning and never seeing a venture through. Insecurity, impostor&#x27;s syndrome, lack of self-esteem... I got it all.<p>I am my own worst enemy.<p>I need to get through my own BS.<p>Any pointers? Leads? Books (I&#x27;ve read so many)?<p>Or should I just be my own life&#x2F;accountability coach and kich my own derriere? Should I just move to a crappy little dark place and deprive myself of food and any pleasures&#x2F;necessities (become hungry by choice) and have my ventures be the ones providing my income, and not my job&#x2F;savings?",
