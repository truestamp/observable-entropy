      "text": "So this month I officially started working with a US based company. Just before joining I started another interview process with a German based company who are willing to sponsor visa if they give an offer. I didn&#x27;t tell them that I recently got an offer and going to start working with them in a few days.<p>Now I have completed their interview process and waiting for the decision from their end. Yesterday the HR emailed me stating that they need some time to sort some things on their end and she asked whether I am in other recruiting process or not?<p>I am not sure what to tell her, I know they are asking this to be sure they don&#x27;t loose me. Should I lie to them that I am in other recruiting process or should I just say that i am not.",
