Things we&#x27;ve tried:<p>1. Cold emailing stores that have downloaded similar apps. \n2. Posting in FB groups (get deleted usually)\n3. Posting in r&#x2F;Shopify (no responses)\n4. Posting in Shopify Discord (mostly devs)<p>For those who have build Shopify apps, any tips on how to find people to get early product feedback?",
