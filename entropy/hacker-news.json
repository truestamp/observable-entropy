      "text": "Hi HN! We built Employees.fyi to make it easy to compare U.S. workforce demographic data across companies and against industry reference data.<p>In the U.S., the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires the collection and submission of demographic workforce data. We collected and organized the publicly available federal data from the EEOC as well as publicly available EEO-1 submissions from individual companies. By doing so, we hope to make it easy to compare U.S. workforce demographic data across companies and against industry reference data.<p>The URL contains your current selection.
