      "text": "I&#x27;m a small shareholder in a private startup.<p>Recently the company has amended the shareholders agreement, to grant themselves:<p>* Right of first refusal on stock sales.<p>* To implement a drag-along-right.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that I should sign the new agreement, since it mostly seems to amount to imposing lots of new restrictions on how I should sell my shares.<p>A bit more information:<p>* My shares are non voting.<p>* The company has several classes of shares. Mine are likely not the best class. (I&#x27;d need to do more research to determine where my class of shares stands relative to the other classes.)<p>I have no further information on what the company now intends to do, whether it be to go public, sell to another company.<p>The only reason I can think of for signing is so that my class of shares gets a fair price if they are considering a private sale.  I can imagine them refusing a favourable price to minority holdouts in such a case.<p>Another outcome might be that I get stuck with an illiquid stock in some other private company.<p>If, on the other hand, they go public, then my shares might become much more valuable.<p>Aside, for &quot;consult a lawyer&quot; does anyone have any ideas&#x2F;advice?",
