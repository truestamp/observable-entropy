      "text": "Hi friends,<p>*Context*:<p>- In 5 years made the transition from Customer Service -&gt; Business Analyst -&gt; BI Developer -&gt; Data Engineer (2m ago);<p>- Plan to stay on DE job at least for 2 years;<p>- Would like to land on a malware analyst (reversing) position eventually;<p>- Since there is a huge skill gap, I&#x27;m seeking jobs that bridge the gap<p>*Research*:<p>- I&#x27;m a self starter but I&#x27;m much more persistent when learning on current job and for next job (when some skills can transfer). Thus it&#x27;s beneficial to find a series of jobs instead of just teaching myself;<p>- Malware analyst needs the following skills: Sys programming, Reading assembly, Using decompiler, Know OS internals, etc. None is needed as a DE.<p>- Possible bridge jobs: DE -&gt; DevOps (more Linux, maybe a bit of security) -&gt; Cyber Security analyst -&gt; Malware analyst<p>*Question*:<p>What is your recommendation? I&#x27;m very curious if anyone actually walked similar roads, maybe not from a DE, but from similar positions.<p>Thanks in advance~~",
