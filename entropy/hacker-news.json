      "text": "The gist of this question is, &quot;how does one prep to keep technology operable?&quot;<p>Imagine a disaster causes widespread collapse, where resources are no longer easily available, power and internet access is erratic or non-existent, and then things calm down enough to where the necessities of life are available and society tries to resume functioning.<p>Now, suppose you&#x27;d like to make computers work. What sort of things would you need?Power, obviously, or a way to charge batteries. What else?<p>What if you wanted to have communication with other people, or perhaps data communication? Would you want packet radio? HAM gear?<p>What if you want to repair equipment? I don&#x27;t know if the computers in cars &quot;break&quot;, for example [not that I imagine fuel being available]. I wonder about what sort of needs there might be to repurpose gear.<p>What if you need to keep an application running? Maybe you have a mesh network and people want a web app for some purpose. But, without documentation, it&#x27;d be incredibly tedious.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think I&#x27;ve seen a linux distro designed for this scenario, where you have binaries, and all the code, and all the toolchains, and all the documentation.<p>The right answer might be &quot;don&#x27;t bother&quot;, but I&#x27;m still curious.",
