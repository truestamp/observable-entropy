All I remember was:<p>- The content of the blog was mostly focused on a variety of interesting math, and computer science topics. The blog was extremely well organized, and covered a breadth of topics.<p>- The UI for the blog had a light purple theme.<p>- The avatar the author used was a Touhou character (I think?)<p>- I think the author&#x27;s username started with an &quot;N&quot;.<p>Does this sound familiar to anyone? Oh if only I&#x27;d bookmarked it!",
