      "text": "Hi, everyone. Been playing around with this recently as a sort of PGP successor. It&#x27;s not all there yet, and I know it&#x27;s missing some things from PGP, but I figured why not get a start and see what kind of interest&#x2F;support it might get.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stamp-protocol.github.io&#x2F;<p>Effectively, this is a key management system that allows building and signing (&quot;stamping&quot;) various claims about yourself and about others. The eventual goal is to create easy-to-use implementations of the protocol that allow logging in to websites or managing cryptographic keys for various security-conscious applications. Secure, simple distributed key management for cryptography and identity management.<p>Currently Stamp uses crypto primitives found in libsodium, but is also built such that different algorithms can be added as needed.<p>The identity itself is set up as a DAG which is appended to by signing transactions with an opinionated set of keys. A DAG was chosen so parallel offline updates could be made and merged later. One of Stamp&#x27;s main features is it allows recovery of the identity via a pre-determined recovery policy, using signatures from trusted keys (friends, family, institutional providers). Think of it as sort of a multisig recovery mechanism.<p>A few things I&#x27;m actively exploring:<p>- A storage network (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stamp-protocol.github.io&#x2F;#arch-stampnet). This would necessarily need to be some sort of p2p system, and hopefully not blockchain-based as I believe the consensus&#x2F;validation used in blockchain systems are superfluous to identity storage and retrieval.<p>- Putting stamp on USB keys&#x2F;embedded devices (ARM TrustZone, RISC-V PMP, etc) so it can be used in more trusted environments.<p>- Some sort of FIDO2 interop would be great so Stamp could act as a login system without having to re-tool a bunch of stuff.<p>There&#x27;s also a somewhat-incomplete CLI implementation of the protocol here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stamp-protocol&#x2F;cli. This allows creation of identities, creating and stamping claims, automatic verification of certain claims (www&#x2F;DNS), as well as cryptographic messaging&#x2F;signing tools.<p>Let me know what you think! What&#x27;s good, what&#x27;s bad, what&#x27;s missing, etc. Obviously it&#x27;s early days so more feedback is better.",
