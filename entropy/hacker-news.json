Look at the countries which don&#x27;t allow each of their citizen to own dozens of guns. Do you now believe that rate of violence directly relates to presnce of guns?<p>2. Take out the guns from you and the people around you, does that make you any less secure?<p>3. Your foundational laws were made by the people, for the people as they made sense in those times, centuries ago. They can be changed by the people, for the people. The fore-fathers expected you to monitor the validity of these laws as the times change, and make necessary changes. And you thought these are unchangeable.<p>Since you can&#x27;t even use common sense to think of this simple ways of disproving your myths, you deserve to be called a stupid. And you probably deserve the deterioration of the quality of life and social conditions around you.",
