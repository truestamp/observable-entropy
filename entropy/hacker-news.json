In particular, Fiji sounds like the most promising market to target initially (based on population, economy, etc.), but I&#x27;m quite open to consider other locations, and eventually intend to have coverage across many areas.<p>I&#x27;m technical and can code, and would particularly be interested in someone who understands the local business environment.<p>Also would be interested in hearing people&#x27;s experiences in the area in general even if they&#x27;re not looking to do a startup.<p>(I did try to use the YC cofounder matching service for this, but it seems that you can&#x27;t specify target location except as a time radius around your current location. Also, searching for similar threads about business in the region returned surprisingly little results.)",
