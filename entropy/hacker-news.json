      "text": "I recently got approached by a well know VC firm about a very early state startup that I&#x27;m building. Since, there was a conflict of interest (they already invested a player in the same marker) he was clear n very upfront about it. The junior VC I met with was very impressed and said that he would love to connect me with the senior team if I want because had some really great ideas. Next day, I woke up and find messages from 2 of the biggest and well know VC firms of Silicon valley asking me if I am interested in meeting them this coming week. \nIs this just a coincidence or these people also have moles on the inside?",
