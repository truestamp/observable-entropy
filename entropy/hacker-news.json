      "text": "This is going to sound like troll bait, so I&#x27;ll start off with a disclaimer: I fully support organizational diversity and I think any tech company would be better off with more women and nonwhite people in its ranks. I want to have a frank discussion about an important subject, not start a political mud-slinging match, so take that elsewhere.<p>Here goes:<p>My startup of ~10 people is outright rejecting all candidates and referrals who are white males. (Yes, really). We just got our series A and have been expanding our personnel, but off the record, management and investors are concerned about the optics of having a company with only white dudes (the company is currently 100% white males). We are still a young enough company where leadership has candor with the rank-and-file engineers such that they feel comfortable being honest with us about this.<p>As a result, in a meeting yesterday afternoon, engineers were specifically told to stop referring candidates from our networks who are white males. They will immediately be rejected.<p>Has anyone else experienced this in a young company? How did it go? How common is this approach generally? Is a policy like this ethical and&#x2F;or legal?<p>Once more, please keep it civil - I know it&#x27;s a controversial subject, but I&#x27;m interested in a thoughtful discussion, not in arguing with trolls. Thanks.",

      "text": "As a deep learning hobbyist, I have a general sense for which GPUs are great and which are awful. But, I&#x27;m less familiar with some of the in-the-middle ones, and I&#x27;m generally curious what criteria pro researchers use. E.g., never use anything besides X, if you were strapped for cash maybe use Y, etc.<p>Here are the main ones I&#x27;ve come across, but maybe people would say others are relevant too.<p>I&#x27;ve included my guesses as to ratings&#x2F;thoughts, as well as current AWS spot price for 1 GPU in east-2. Does this assessment seem roughly right? Am I missing anything? Obviously assessing these can be very complicated based on what exactly you&#x27;re using them for; I&#x27;m just looking for very high level thoughts.<p>A100\n9.5&#x2F;10 - among the best available now?\n$1.39&#x2F;hr (this is an estimate; AWS actually only offers an 8 GPU instance for $11.15&#x2F;hr so I just divided by 8)<p>V100\n8.5&#x2F;10 - very good\n$0.92&#x2F;hr<p>P100\n8&#x2F;10 - good, used a fair amount in research\nAWS doesn&#x27;t seem to offer these anymore? Replaced by V100s?<p>T4\n5&#x2F;10 - I don&#x27;t know. Do people use these ever?\n$0.36&#x2F;hr<p>M60\n2&#x2F;10 - I don&#x27;t really know. I assume bad\n$0.34&#x2F;hr<p>K80\n1&#x2F;10 - crap, basically don&#x27;t ever waste your time\n$0.27&#x2F;hr",
