      "text": "It seems a lot of people in tech believe the ability for anybody to share largely unmoderated content on large social media platforms is very important for free&#x2F;open online communication. At the same time you could argue there is a desire&#x2F;need to combat spam, disinformation campaigns, propaganda, hate speech, AI generated content, etc.<p>Much of the discussion around content moderation is about the many challenges, sometimes suggesting it is an impossible problem to solve. A lot of discussion also suggests content moderation is inherently bad because “free speech”. However, lots of problems are technically challenging and&#x2F;or ethically challenging (e.g., self driving cars), but are not discussed the same way.<p>A perfect solution to content moderation likely does not exist, but I am curious what companies are working solely on providing content moderation as a service and what innovative solutions are being proposed. Also, what is the state of the art in content moderation research assuming such a thing exists?",
