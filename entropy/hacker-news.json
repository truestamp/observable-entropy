      "text": "For years I used a Wacom tablet stylus as I felt it helped lessen my wrist pain.  However I stopped using it once I read the driver was tracking my use: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22247292.  Now I just use a standard Logitech mouse though it is old, and the buttons are starting to fail.  I use Kinesis Ergo keyboard and absolutely love it.  I am considering a Kinesis Vertical Mouse: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kinesis-ergo.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;#mice-and-pointing-devices though the idea of a vertical mouse seems strange to me.   Anyone have experience with it or something else?  There are some old HN threads about this. I am looking for up to date options.",
