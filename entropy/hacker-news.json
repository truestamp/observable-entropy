      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m excited to build something for the new Stripe Apps marketplace and landed on the idea of a tool to query your Stripe data using natural language instead of SQL (e.g. asking &quot;How many customers are on annual subscriptions?&quot; rather than writing a SQL query). Seems like it could be useful for users who don&#x27;t know how to code in particular.<p>This isn&#x27;t a Show HN as I&#x27;m at the discovery stage here so I just thought I&#x27;d ask here if people would envision this being useful in their companies.<p>Quick landing page here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cashquery-marketing-site.vercel.app&#x2F;",
