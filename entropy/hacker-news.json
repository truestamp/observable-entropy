Kindle.Devices.HomePage.Actions.Ereader.csv ) also logged is the time you add or delete a wifi network (Profile Delete Confirmation)  and just hundreds and hundreds of logs.<p>amazon also saves a recording and audio transcript of everything you ask with a corresponding ID to the recording.<p>Take a look at Amazon history if you have an account.
