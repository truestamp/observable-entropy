      "text": "https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mwerezak&#x2F;sphinx-lang<p>An implementation of a dynamic programming language in Rust. Includes: Parser&#x2F;Compiler, REPL, Virtual Machine, Bytecode Disassembler<p>This started out as a learning project to teach myself Rust. It has grown into a decently substantial piece of software and I&#x27;ve learned quite a bit in the process!<p>Some neat things:<p>+ A garbage collector that can store dynamically sized types without any double-indirection (i.e. I have my own Box implementation with manual alloc&#x2F;dealloc)<p>+ The smart pointer used to reference GCed data is a thin pointer. The ptr metadata needed for DSTs is stored in the GC allocation itself, so that the GC smart pointer is just a single usize wide. This allows me to keep the core value enum Variant down to 16 bytes (8 bytes for data, the enum discriminant, and some padding).<p>+ The GC also supports weak references!<p>+ Statically dispatched type object model using a newtype wrapper and Rust&#x27;s declarative macros. Ok, what that means is that I have a MetaObject trait that I can use to easily add new data types and define the behavior for specific types. Similar idea to Python&#x27;s PyTypeObject though very different in implementation. However, I don&#x27;t resort to dynamic dispatch or trait objects despite working with dynamically type data. Instead, I have a newtype wrapper over the core value enum Variant that statically dispatches to each of the enum branches! And then a few macros that minimize the boilerplate required if I want to add a new branch to Variant or a new method to MetaObject (just a single line in each case).<p>+ Different string representations! This was inspired by the flexstr crate. Strings that are short enough to fit inside a Variant are &quot;inlined&quot; directly in the value. Longer strings are either GCed or interned in a thread-local string table. All identifiers are interned.<p>+ An efficient implementation of closures inspired by Lua&#x27;s upvalues.<p>The language is still pretty WIP. I&#x27;m planning to add an import system, a small standard library, and a few other things<p>(Yes, the name might not be the best, being also used by a well-known ReST docs generator, I&#x27;ll take suggestions. I do like the name though, both as a reference to the mythological creature and the cat :D)",
