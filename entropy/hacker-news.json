(Not necessarily Apple-specific)<p>I&#x27;ve previously looked into Mozilla Common Voice before but it wasn&#x27;t really strong enough. I&#x27;ve heard there are tools that can detect multiple speakers these days - can anyone vouch for them? Is real-time transcription good enough yet to be a realistic option?",
