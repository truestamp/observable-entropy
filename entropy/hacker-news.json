      "text": "I have for over 10 years worked in a large research lab in Boston on a variety of algorithms, software and systems related to sensors, cameras, data fusion and decision support. I am now considering a domain switch and am looking for advice. Not so much for specific openings (although this is good, too), but primarily an approach for a senior&#x2F;lead engineer in one field to switch to a lower level rung in a different field.<p>Biotech, robotics, medical devices are potential examples, but most things that touch more than one of (software, algorithms and hardware) are interesting to me.<p>The main reason for wanting to switch is that I want to learn new things. A close second is the growing bureaucracy at my current, large employer. I am not desperate -- my employer likes me and the pay is good. But the work is becoming frustratingly slow and the amount of red tape goes up every year.<p>The good: I have (says me) a good, transferable set of general skills: software (C++, Python, Java, scripting, Matlab), algorithms (data fusion, some ML and AI, image and video processing, real time systems, large data sets), data science, analysis and a solid math background.<p>The bad: I am in my late 40s and have a PhD with 20 years of experience in my work. A quick search led to a couple of suggestions for a principal&#x2F;lead scientist or engineer positions for which I am nowhere near qualified (since this is another field).<p>More good: I do not need a lot of money; not looking for FAANG salaries.<p>Any advice? Take classes? Rub shoulders at conferences?",
