      "text": "Hi HN!\nWe just released Prepress, which is like Netlify but from your own cloud account on all major cloud providers. On top of the basics of building the static site, deploying it to your cloud storage and taking care of the DNS and SSL certs, we also have a CEL based rule engine sitting in front of the site which allows you to configure and redirect traffic with great flexibility. We&#x27;ve also included LiveLogs which shows live and enriched traffic logs to the site.<p>Prepress includes free teams, ACL and git integration (Github, Gitlab or self hosted) without any charge.",
