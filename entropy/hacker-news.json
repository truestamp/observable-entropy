      "text": "For the last while I have developed a machine learning platform that I believe is valuable. The algorithms work, and while some are public, they are mostly only exposed via recent research papers with no public implementation&#x2F;trained models. All questions aside to whether that is true, I developed the platform to support ten or so startup ideas. Probably some will not work. The idea is then to set up new startups for each idea, find a non technical cofounder, and give them significant equity in that particular business vertical.<p>So from a legal perspective, the IP sits in a separate company, which bills the consuming company for the compute, and the startup sits in a separate entity, from which the non technical founder has equity.<p>Is this common? Are there other ways to think about it?<p>Obviously should talk to a lawyer, and yes I know ideas are cheap, but here I have already reached 90% of the technical implementation for each idea. Other caveats, I am aware startups are hard, most fail, I should focus on one, etc.",
