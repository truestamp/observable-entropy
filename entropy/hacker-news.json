I don&#x27;t have a job lined up, which is fine - I&#x27;m taking a little break before starting my job search later this summer. I&#x27;m looking for new hobbies to look into to spark new interests or expand upon existing ones. Or if you have advice on what you would do in this time in your life (I&#x27;m 22 years old), I&#x27;m open to hearing that as well.",
