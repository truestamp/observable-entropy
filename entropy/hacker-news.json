      "text": "I&#x27;ve been in the service related business for almost four years now. I provided a service for people who want to make VR apps. But, I still struggle to build a system that runs without me being involved in technical things. And from the financial aspect, I often feel insecure and worry if we can cover the company&#x27;s expenses for the next several months. I just feel that my life and the life my company depends on the projects that&#x27;s still a mystery right now. With all those experience and feeling, I start to question; is providing service is a scalable business model?",
