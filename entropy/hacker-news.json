      "text": "I started learning japanese a few weeks ago and I find I had difficulties memorizing the kanas.<p>So I decided to create a set of flashcards with LateX I could print with my own printer to work on it.<p>As it might help some people and as I didn&#x27;t find any set of cards with all those infos, I&#x27;m releasing it under CC BY-SA 4.0. some images are taken from Wikimpedia, attributions &amp; licence are listed in a dedicated file.<p>As said I&#x27;m only learning and I&#x27;m not at all fluent in JP so there is possibly some errors and it&#x27;s definitly still missing some pronunciation exemples.<p>The LateX structure is also probably horrible, sorry about that.<p>I&#x27;m open to any and all suggestions to improve it.",
