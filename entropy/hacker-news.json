      "text": "I&#x27;m a dev myself, and also someone with a lot of ideas (mainly SaaS, online businesses etc). In the past couple of years I&#x27;ve built most of these ideas (or at least some kind of MVP) myself, and had fun doing so. However, as I get older, I don&#x27;t want to code that much anymore.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a long-term companion to code stuff for me. I just got an idea for a new search engine? I&#x27;ll ask them to hack a crawler for it. I want to extract some data from a dataset and build some visualization? Call them to write the SQL queries.<p>I guess a freelancer is the closest to what I&#x27;m looking for. However, whereas freelancers are generally mission-based, I&#x27;d want someone 1&#x2F; for the longer term to reduce search effort per mission, and 2&#x2F; with the following traits:\n- a early-stage startup CTO mindset,\n- jack of all trades,\n- okay to write dirty&#x2F;hacky code,\n- has fun doing hackathons or weekend side projects.<p>A &quot;dev concierge&quot; is the closest analogy I can think of.<p>Some more practical details that may help: Billed by the hour, remote, market rate. Each &quot;mission&quot; takes maybe 20-40 hours to complete, and I have 1-2 of those ideas per month, constantly.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve noticed a ton of crypto scams on YouTube recently, many of which are using the names of legitimate channels (like SpaceX), re-posting content from those channels and promoting scams – usually in the form of &quot;send me [Elon Musk, Jeff Bezoz, etc] BTC, and I&#x27;ll send you 2x back&quot;.<p>It seems reasonable to expect one or two of these to slip through the cracks now and then, but over the past few months, I&#x27;ve had YouTube &quot;recommend&quot; these to me, again and again, multiple times per day. I&#x27;ve often reported them as spam, only to have YouTube <i>recommend the exact same video to me a few minutes later</i>. I don&#x27;t know anyone who would fall for the scams in the videos, but they&#x27;ve become so common now that it&#x27;s getting <i>really</i> annoying.<p>You can&#x27;t tell me that they&#x27;re too difficult to distinguish from legitimate content. Any human being or half-decent algorithm would be able to catch these with no trouble at all (heck, I could write a couple of regular expressions that would do the trick and have 0 false positives), which leads me to wonder: why is YouTube promoting these videos? At this point, it feels like they must have some incentive <i>not</i> to shut them down, because it would require deliberate effort to have <i>any</i> form of spam control while also somehow letting these through.<p>Am I the only one noticing this?",
