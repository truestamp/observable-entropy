I could code this from scratch, but holy cow I&#x27;d really prefer not to. :-)<p>My use case: I&#x27;m a domain expert for the content, and also a senior dev. I&#x27;m comfortable with most programming languages and tools.<p>Is Discourse a good choice? I don&#x27;t necessarily need the forum, although its forum support is fantastic. Does it have good support (maybe with an extension) for FAQs?<p>The Ghost Blogging platform also looks like very high quality, but on the downside it&#x27;s not really a collaborative platform out of the box.<p>How about static site generators? Jekyll or something else? If the Q&amp;A is GitHub based, then that&#x27;d work, but it wouldn&#x27;t be very accessible to non-techie people.<p>Anything else I should consider? I&#x27;m ok with for-pay in addition to hosting my own.",
