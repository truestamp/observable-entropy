      "text": "I&#x27;ve been curious to see how folks are changing their behavior. I get a feeling that most people use Desktop&#x2F;Laptops for work mostly and their mobile devices for more casual activities.<p>The shift in behavior is interesting, but I believe we&#x27;re spending a great deal of time on our mobile devices for multiple reasons. The devices are more powerful, screens are larger and the functionality provided by applications has improved greatly over the last 5-10 years.<p>How would you break your time up on your laptop&#x2F;desktop vs. Mobile?<p>For me:<p>Work: 95% Laptop&#x2F;Desktop and 5% mobile\nSocial&#x2F;Casual: 90% Mobile and 10% laptop&#x2F;desktop.<p>I would also throw tablets under the mobile space.",
