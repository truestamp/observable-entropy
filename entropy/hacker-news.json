      "text": "After reading both Range and Outliers there‘s one worry that has stayed with me.<p>I would like to start my sidehustle and start off with a blog, but whenever I pick out an area, I get an uncomfortable feeling.<p>Mainly because I have the feeling that only one area will bore me and that all other skills would remain unused.<p>I know that as a founder you need to master many things and I would love to develop software, but I can&#x27;t code.<p>Whenever I think of a business that I could start, e.g. ecommerce or marketing service, I feel like I&#x27;m at a disadvantage because there are hundreds of thousands of competitors who do it successfully as specialists.<p>How do I deal with the worry if I want to focus on one subject area as a generalist, 1. leave other skills unused and 2. probably never become as good and ambitious as a specialist?<p>Have you guys ever dealt with this question and&#x2F;or have any tips on this dilemma?",
