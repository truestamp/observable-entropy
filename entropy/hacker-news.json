And after getting over the shock of the message I immediately thought: &quot;This film couldn&#x27;t have been made for a theatrical release, only a streamer like Netflix could have published this, because of the ending.&quot; The ending would not have &quot;focus grouped&quot; well and the movie would have tanked. But streaming changes that calculus and I am happy for that.<p>On the whole, the film is great, just as a film goes: the acting, the dialog, the delivery, the editing, all of it great.",

      "text": "Hi,\nCan somebody please explain&#x2F;point me to some tool that can explain what I saw today?<p>It was cca 17:20 CET local time, location is 49.054653, 20.212259, I was looking north with maybe 80° angle (so almost vertical but slightly towards north), and I&#x27;ve noticed a straight line of satellites, flying from west towards east. I could count at least 40 from the moment I&#x27;ve noticed them till the point a small cloud came and obscured that part of the sky. After it went away few minutes later, the show was over. No clue what was happening before I gazed randomly up and noticed it.<p>They were 100% satellites, uniform luminostity of all of them - cca like a faintly visible stars, they were spaced evenly in straight line and flew at same speeds(with some uniform gaps sometimes, so I saw exactly 1&#x2F;2 were missing&#x2F;non visible). Also the speed has been quite significant, a plane flying cca 11km above goes slower through the sky (there were few up there to compare).<p>In best case there were around 10 of them visible in the same time - a literal belt of lights moving across the sky, appearing on my left and disappearing on my right. It felt pretty surreal, like I&#x27;ve teleported 50 years into the future where this is common sight and sky is overcrowded.<p>Maybe some Starlink batch of satellites aligned before they disperse into their own orbits? Or did I miss something and this is pretty common these days?",
