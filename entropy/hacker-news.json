      "text": "Every time I used the BK app it charges me for the food but the store never gets the order. I checked the address that it was the right store and it said purchase was approved. The store never gets the order and I have to order again at the register. It is an Android Samsung phone and my son has a newer Samsung phone and it happens to him as well. I tried reporting it to BK but they never get back. Competitor apps work just fine just not BK&#x27;s app. Anyone know how to fix it or tell BK to fix it? It is frustrating that the orders do not go through. We get an order number and get charged, but no order gets through. Anyone else have this problem?",
