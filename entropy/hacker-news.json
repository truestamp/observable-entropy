      "text": "I deactivated my facebook account in 2010 after using that tool a couple of times to take breaks from FB. The messaging in the email says you can reactivate at any time using your email and password.<p>Recently I wanted to open it back up to use the data export and grab all those memories.<p>I still use that email (which includes my full name), but it puts me in a loop of requesting a passport or state ID, and a video of my face.<p>I&#x27;ve submitted pictures of my passport and ID over a dozen times to no avail, and cant find a human to troubleshoot.  Is there any way to recover this account information?",
