      "text": "I just discovered that I really like watching people code, and it&#x27;s a great source of learning for me just through observation.<p>My main requirements:\n- Not a &quot;tutorial&quot;. I don&#x27;t want someone who has already scripted and prepared all the steps for the video. Looking for something more improvisational, of course, ideally they should be experienced or produce high quality code and at least partially explain their thought process as they&#x27;re doing it.\n- Preferably web dev focused - I&#x27;ve been trying to hone my skills with HTML &#x2F; CSS &#x2F; JS &#x2F; TS and React mainly, but really open to anything if I think I can learn some good coding practices from it.<p>An example of a recent one I liked was: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=K77xThbu66A<p>However, I would prefer something a little less hacky than this if possible. Still was a decent view to follow along.",
