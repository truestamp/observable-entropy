      "text": "HI!  Looking for a no-code SaaS solution with really good UI for a non-technical person to upload a file and extract structured data.  The files are likely to be in TXT, CSV, or Excel format.  Files will yield multiple rows of data, so the UI should make it relatively easy to identify the pattern&#x2F;structure of fields, and then allow the user execute parsing, compare the resulting structured data against what the user sees, and iterate until it&#x27;s solid.<p>I swear in the last month or so that such a product appeared on HN, but I&#x27;ve spent an hour combing thru browser history and searching HN, with no luck.  I think I saw it on my phone using one of the popular HN apps that uses an embedded web browser, so there is no &quot;history&quot; feature.",
