      "text": "Wishing to see an article, Quora required a sign-in through 3rd party auth. Upon signing in, I unwittingly opted in to getting subscribed to regular Quora emails. This is part 1 - the unrequested subscription.<p>Now, for part 2: upon trying to unsubscribe, I find out that my unsubscribe clicks aren&#x27;t working as expected. It&#x27;s because on closer inspection, the email footer link takes you to page that merely allows unsubscribing from a small subset of these emails. I then find hidden (in the depths of the site, not the email) the full unsubscribe option - which is not an unsubscribe option at all (it doesn&#x27;t exist), but rather the option to delete the account. However, Quora blocks me from using this prior to creating a first-party user account with them (recall I signed in through 3rd party auth).<p>Fuck &#x27;em, I just blocked and spammed Quora from there.",
