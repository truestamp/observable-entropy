      "text": "Looking at the news it&#x27;s ever harder to not get depressed. At least for me. A loud  voice in my head is saying that everything is devolving as far as humans societies are concerned. Crisis after crisis and news showing that everyday people are just breaking up causing havoc around them. And an ever increasing pile of problems waiting to turn into crisis.<p>Under that light my job (marketing analytics sw) seems pointless if not detrimental. But any direction I looked to kind of help out with the things that matter seemed a dead end. There are just no jobs about climate change or school violence. No startups addressing these issues. It seems to me that it is almost impossible to put any effort in what matter which increases the sense of me living in a bubble about to burst at first contact with reality.<p>Dunno. How do feel about all these and bow do you deal with it?",
