And we also want to learn skills not related to the job.<p>* &quot;Upskill yourself during the weekdays, enjoy the weekends.&quot;<p>This is probably quite practical for WFH people. But where I live, commute and office job generally take 8am to 7pm in the day. There won&#x27;t be much time left.<p>* &quot;Upskill during weekends.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s an option, but we all want to have fun during weekends and dedicate time for hobbies as well.<p>So, young (22-35 yo) engineers on HN, how and when do you upskill yourself? Any techniques?",
