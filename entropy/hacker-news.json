      "text": "I want to release a software application so that everyone can use it for free, non-commercially.<p>With non-commercial I mean: I&#x27;m fine if companies use it internally, as long as they don&#x27;t start selling the software itself or use it in a marketed software product.<p>There is a lot of online advice for licensing open-source software, but I am not interested in releasing the source code, and the software does not include any GPL-licensed components.<p>Obviously: IANAL - as in: totally clueless.<p>Does the question even make sense? Do binaries even <i>need</i> a license?\nTo me one thing that <i>would</i> make it require a license is the &quot;non-commercial use&quot;.\nAnother thing might be that I want people to be able to use it, and sometimes the absence of a license, the legal uncertainty that brings, is inhibitive.<p>Any advice, discussion or links are very much appreciated.",
