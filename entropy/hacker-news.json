      "text": "Hi HN.<p>Some of my recent hobby projects have involved user&#x27;s uploading their own files, such as videos, images, and generally things that don&#x27;t belong in most databases. It&#x27;s important to me that if they were to trust me with their content that I&#x27;d have reliable storage - so I don&#x27;t want to spin up my own solution for this and looked around to find something that already exists.<p>The obvious first place was AWS S3, and while it doesn&#x27;t directly serve this need you can set it up to do so with presigned URLs and object permissions (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AmazonS3&#x2F;latest&#x2F;userguide&#x2F;ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html). This can work, but as far as object storage goes AWS is very expensive. I also looked into Google Storage through Firebase (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firebase.google.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;storage) which with some configuration through Firebase authentication can also achieve (but locks you into their auth) - and again, very expensive.<p>My ideal would be an option like Backblaze B2, which is considerably cheaper - but isn&#x27;t designed with this use-case in mind. Depsite having an AWS compatible API, and supporting pre-signed URLs, I couldn&#x27;t find a reliable way to assign objects to users through metadata.<p>I was really hoping for some easy-to-use white label solution for this, but it just seems like it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>So what do people do for things like this? My AC is:<p>- Allow specific users to upload any media<p>- Allow user &gt; object assignment<p>- Some auth around the above<p>- Reasonably priced (minimal egress costs)",
