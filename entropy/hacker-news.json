      "text": "My question is basically, am I missing something?<p>I finished the first two seasons of Westworld in preparation for the 4th season starting on Sunday. My personal reason for liking both Westworld and Mr. Robot is that these shows helped me recover because they are about waking up and moments of clarity, also part of recovery. The integration of trauma personalities at the end of season 4 of Mr. Robot was particularly helpful.<p>Westworld is about a lot of things, some interesting, some not:<p>A) Artificially intelligent robots achieving self-awareness and free will. Dominating humans with their superior abilities. Symbiosis with genius humans to create a human&#x2F;machine super intelligence.<p>B) The rise of the technocratic class of people who write the software algorithms and stories that increasingly dominate our daily lives and determine the choices we have available<p>C) The thousand year quest to achieve human immortality<p>D) Creating utopias in virtual reality that provide near-perfect worlds to live in<p>E) Questions about memory and why it haunts us and androids<p>F) The violence and evil that lurks in the hearts of humans<p>G) Good old-fashioned action adventure, shoot-em-up stories<p>H) Glorification of Western colonial imperialism and the domination of other peoples and cultures<p>I) Predatory capitalism that has a low disregard for any form of life<p>I&#x27;m mostly interested in A thru E and think those parts are brilliant. I am not interested in F thru I and watched hitting the fast forward button a lot since this is my second time. I paused, studied and tried to understand season 1. I fast forwarded through most of season 2, where the colonial imperialism and first person shooter stuff was predominant.",
