      "text": "For the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;ve been suffering an absolute inability to be productive at work. I mean spending the whole day staring at the screen not writing a single line of code.<p>At first I thought it was a problem of attention, since I was being distracted by literally anything, from a text to street noise. But even removing all distractions and putting on some noise cancelling headphones won&#x27;t do the trick. I just feel... unable to start.<p>It&#x27;s a feeling that&#x27;s really difficult to explain. Like the feeling that keeps you from jumping into a swimming pool when you&#x27;re at the edge. I don&#x27;t find work unpleasant, not the tasks that I have in front of me difficult, and I&#x27;m not particularly bored, or tense, or anything. I just can&#x27;t do it.<p>Is this normal? Any of you have any idea about how to deal with this problem?",

      "text": "I suspect this idea has already appeared quite a bit on HN already, but I&#x27;d quite like to train a language model to detect language intended to persuade. The model would then be exposed via an API so that I could build a browser extension which would examine social media posts and mark them accordingly.<p>Quite apart from the expense I&#x27;ll incur training this model, I&#x27;m struggling to figure out a way of finding enough definitive propaganda to begin with given that it&#x27;s such a subjective topic. Ideally I&#x27;d use a wide variety of propaganda types such as advertising, political propaganda, social media comments plugging a given product or service, and other categories of propaganda. Is anybody here on HN aware of any collections of propaganda I can easily ingest in a machine-readable form or failing that, have any ideas of how I could go about constructing one myself?<p>This is purely a personal project with no desire for monetisation, I&#x27;m just curious to know how much of my browsing does actually consist of propaganda given it&#x27;s such a topic of discussion at the moment.",
