      "text": "Last week, I shared my project Trane (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trane-project&#x2F;trane\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trane-project&#x2F;trane</a>), an automated system for learning new skills. There are some courses at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trane-project&#x2F;trane-music\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trane-project&#x2F;trane-music</a>, but I figured it&#x27;d be nice to have a self-contained course to showcase Trane and something related to programming since Trane is in an early stage, and it&#x27;s not likely non-technical users will try it.<p>Given that Trane is my first Rust project, I figured it&#x27;d be nice to augment rustlings (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rustlings&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;rustlings&#x2F;</a>) with Trane. The result is trane-rustlings (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trane-project&#x2F;trane-rustlings\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trane-project&#x2F;trane-rustlings</a>).<p>This course is an example of how existing educational materials can be easily augmented with Trane. The exercises in this course just reference the exercises in rustlings by name. By solving the rustlings exercises in the order Trane presents them, you progressively gain mastery of all of them, while reinforcing them as you go along.<p>If you find you are being shown the same exercises too many times (specially at the beginning) then you can either finish your study session and continue later to have time to absorb the material or add the exercise to the blacklist, so it&#x27;s not shown ever again (Trane will act as if that exercise has been fully mastered).<p>I also added a documentation site (still under development): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trane-project.github.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trane-project.github.io&#x2F;</a> Instructions on how to use the command-line interface are there.<p>If you end up trying it, let me know what you think.",
