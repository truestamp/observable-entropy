      "text": "Apparently the tech job market is crazy. I started applying 2 weeks ago. Majority of the applications aren&#x27;t even viewed. So far, I have had only two recruiter calls. Both didn&#x27;t proceed since they were looking for hands on in particular areas. And I got a few rejection emails too.(Not sure if they are the usual automated Applicant Tracking System generated rejections or someone indeed looked at it). I fear my career in the software field is over. Questions.<p>1. Can we say the market good only for junior developers? How good&#x2F;bad is it for the experienced ( 20+ years) individual contributors?\n2. Is the job search worth the effort?. Would it be a better idea to learn some skills and start building something on your own?\n3. My profile is decent and I work for a reasonably reputed company. But my linkedin profile is empty since I am not comfortable with others viewing my profile. (Mentioned only the company names, start date etc).  So I havent had any recruiter reach me directly. Nor did I contact any recruiter. Any general tips on resume&#x2F;getting noticed ( Without updating linkedin profile)?<p>PS: I received tons of calls from recruiters for jobs in the service based companies. But I am looking at product based companies only. Also, I do understand that networking&#x2F;referral will help. But I dont have a good network.",
