      "text": "Long story short over all these years I never bothered with Facebook. It turns out some hobby groups only exist on there, so I created an account about a week ago.<p>I&#x27;m shocked at how buggy the Android app is for such a large tech company with so many years and so much money being thrown at engineers. I hear on HN about massive 6-7 figure salaries yet their main product barely works.<p>Some of the bugs I see every time I use the app are:<p>1) App randomly closes<p>2) Hiding suggested group posts says they won&#x27;t show me that again... Followed by endless pages of posts from those groups<p>3) Closed suggested friends reappear as soon as I reopen the app<p>4) Pressing the back button sometimes closes the app instead of going back a screen<p>5) The bar to sort posts randomly appears when scrolling then disappears just as quickly with no known way to get it back<p>6) Tapping notifications doesn&#x27;t scroll to the comment referenced, half of the time it&#x27;s not even in the list<p>And overall just constant confusion because nothing seems to do what you expect.<p>It&#x27;s almost as if the app is actively trying to prevent the user doing what they want.<p>So I wanted to know if Facebook has always been this bad at UX and execution but people just put up with it or is it a recent phenomena? Or perhaps Facebook has become so widely used that no regular user even notices, like when you take a shit but don&#x27;t notice how bad it smells because your brain filters it out?",
