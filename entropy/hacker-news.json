      "text": "How can I raise my first round of capital?\nDo I need a product? What metrics do I need to show?<p>I kept asking these questions months after starting work on \nat Alpe Audio. The more I asked, the more I realized it wasn’t only me asking those questions.<p>So I documented how we did it...\nEarly stage fundraising is the most misunderstood and untold stage of startup life.<p>I&#x27;m talking pre product, pre traction, when you&#x27;ve only got an idea.<p>What do you need to raise? How many meetings? Who do you talk to?\nEvery week since launch I documented who we met, what they asked, what part of the story worked and what didn&#x27;t.<p>The TL:DR is: \n1) It took 263 meetings with over 200 prospective investors over 12 months to raise our initial capital that got us going.\n2) Story matters more than traction. \nAfter those 200+ meetings, I’m convinced that at early stages, traction matters least simply because unless you&#x27;ve got Snapchat like numbers, almost no numbers wow enough.\n3) Founder market fit is a critical part of a startups story and allaying investor concerns.<p>Make sure you tie yourself into reducing risk for VCs.<p>2 tips:<p>• Focus on your story and use it to help investors de-risk investing in you. Traction can be a part of that, but don’t bet on traction alone.<p>• Trust the process. Build the pipeline, run through it.  You can get 100 ‘no’s’, but you only need one ‘yes’ to make.<p>Full blog, charts andd the deck we used is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alpeaudio.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;how-we-raised-our-first-round-of-venture-capital-263-meetings-12-months-128700&#x2F;<p>Comments and thoughts welcome!",
