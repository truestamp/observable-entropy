I am looking for respondents to answer a couple of questions (10 min) for our app.\nWe would love talking to you if:<p>1. You have ever had to conduct user interviews and struggled to find respondents\n2. You care about stray animals and environment\nSorry, cannot reveal the whole idea before we ask our questions since it may interfere your reasoning and make you biased. But shortly, our app will have 3 parties: people who need to conduct user interviews, respondents for those interviews, stray animals (our main player).\nLooking forward to connecting with you :)",
