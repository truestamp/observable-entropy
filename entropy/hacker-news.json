      "text": "I make a digital product and want to sell it and so have been looking around for services that allow me to do it.<p>I haven&#x27;t messed around with payments before but I&#x27;ve heard a bunch of good things about stripe so I checked it out and the payment side looks great but I&#x27;m still a bit fuzzy and the best way to fulfill the digital product.<p>Gumroad seems to be an option, and I like that I can just embed it on my existing site (rather than use squarespace, for example) but I feel like I&#x27;m missing something since I can&#x27;t find any others,<p>Any tips on where I can look?",
