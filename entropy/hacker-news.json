I feel bored by the work I do. I’ve changed jobs twice in the last year and that hasn’t made a difference. Has anyone else experienced this and found a more fulfilling role?<p>I’ve worked with Rails, many JS frameworks, Docker, native and React Native mobile development, PHP, and some other random things scattered in over the years. All I can conclude is that I’m tired of writing code. What can I do with my skill set? I’d hate to start over from scratch.<p>Thanks for reading.",
