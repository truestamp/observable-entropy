      "text": "Forgive my ignorance on this subject but I&#x27;m curious what others on HN have to say. I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;ve never been that familiar with advanced networking concepts like this, and I&#x27;m testing the waters on this site with regards to best practice discussion threads like this.<p>I&#x27;ve long had a fascination with the concept of easily establishing a TCP or UDP connection easily over the internet between two systems (Linux, Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, embedded Linux, embedded C, etc.) without having to resort to port forwarding.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve come to really like VNC Connect, which is a built in service installed on Raspberry Pi devices. In an attempt to help out my less-than-techsaavy parents, I&#x27;ve installed Raspberry Pi&#x27;s on their networks at two of their houses (snowbirds) so I can remotely assist with anything from internet issues to helping them set up surveillance cameras. Having the ability to VNC to a Raspberry Pi on any internet connected network from any other internet connected network without port forwarding, or even having to know the internet facing IP address is a god send.<p>I&#x27;ve also in the past served as an industrial controls engineer, where often after I would finish integrating a system at a site, I would install an internet hardware appliance that would allow me to establish a VPN connection to the remote control network over the internet from anywhere else in the world (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ewon.biz&#x2F;products&#x2F;cosy). Doing so made troubleshooting with my customer&#x27;s controls engineers much easier since I had access to their local network without having to configure port forwarding or know their internet facing IP address.<p>My questions then are:\n1) is this concept something that has an actual name? I&#x27;ve heard of this ability referred to as a &quot;reverse proxy&quot; or a &quot;no config direction connection&quot;.\n2) is there an existing open source project or methodology that allows for this sort of connection that is agnostic of platform? For example, if I didn&#x27;t want to pay for RealVNC&#x27;s exorbitant pricing plans for more than 5 devices, could I configure some sort of setup with an AWS instance that automatically connects clients on separate networks together? (So I could have 100 Raspberry Pi&#x27;s out on different local networks that could be access by me through VNC on my laptop&#x2F;phone?)",
