      "text": "Hi HN,<p>About a year ago I wrote a few scripts and spreadsheets to calculate the historical performance of various passive investment portfolios. There is portfoliovisualizer.com but if you are not from the US it&#x27;s less relevant because everything is calculated with respect to the US dollar, and you cannot combine funds from other countries (say from the EU).<p>In the past month I managed to turn it into a web app with the goal of giving individuals better tools for financial education. It allows you to build a portfolio composed of a few index funds (ETFs or mutual funds) and simulate its historical performance. It currently works with 7 currencies and includes funds from the US, EU, UK, Canada and Israel. Intentionally, only broad-market, passive index funds are included.<p>If all of this doesn&#x27;t mean much to you, you can visit the examples page to get a taste of some interesting portfolios. Here is an interesting example: For the past 22 years, US long-term treasuries had very similar returns to the S&amp;P 500 (cherry-picked dates, but still interesting) [1].<p>On the technical side: The backend is a simple Flask app. A task runs once a day in the background to fetch the latest prices of ETFs and mutual funds from 20+ sources (central banks, stock exchanges). Frontend is Tailwind for CSS and a bit of native Javascript with d3. Everything runs on a $10&#x2F;mo VPS.<p>This is my first web app and there is still a lot of room for improvement so any feedback is welcome.<p>Thanks in advance!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pumbaa.app&#x2F;backtest?b=1&amp;currency=USD&amp;initialBalance=1000&amp;rebalanceFreq=Annually&amp;dividends=1&amp;startMonth=1&amp;startYear=2000&amp;endMonth=2&amp;endYear=2022&amp;assetName_1=VUSTX&amp;assetName_2=SPY&amp;portfolioName_1=Long-Term+Treasury&amp;assetAllocation_1_1=100&amp;portfolioName_2=S%26P+500&amp;assetAllocation_2_2=100\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pumbaa.app&#x2F;backtest?b=1&amp;currency=USD&amp;initialBalance=...</a>",
