I would use something like python Tesseract.<p>Which idk watch your network I guess if it phones home.<p>This would all run locally but it&#x27;s that thing of convenience&#x2F;using something off the shelf that works. More hardcore &quot;safer&quot; would be use OpenCV on its own and do my own image interpretation which would mean longer time to achieve the original goal.<p>Of course easiest solution is just &quot;write something down&quot; everyday.<p>I just was wondering what did I do the last week&#x2F;how was I productive.",
