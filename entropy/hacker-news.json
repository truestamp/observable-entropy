All of the searches are using duckduckgo. Then, this happened. This happened to me a few times already.<p>One of my web pages was redirected to a Zsh download for Mac from coldballs.co.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coldballs.co&#x2F;zsh-for-mac-os&#x2F; (be careful with this link if you are on Mac)<p>This link is masqueraded as a Mac App Store download page.<p>On my Ubuntu machine, the link above looks fine.<p>Then, I searched the same query on google. I won’t be able to see this website on the top search pages.<p>What is going on here? Anyone can explain? Thanks.",
