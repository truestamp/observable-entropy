      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;m Daniel, currently 22 years old, could you guide me towards understanding myself?<p>About mid last year an old friend called me up presenting an idea for a company.\nTogether, we do an excellent job serving our customers.\nAnd then December comes around, And I have started procrastinating, no longer responding to my partner, not attending the office for the past months. The worst part is the projects I have promised to customers, have not been complete.\nAt first, I attributed this behavior to burn out as we have been working for 12 plus hour shifts for six, seven days a week. But as I am learning, this seems to be because of passive-aggressive behavior.\nBefore we started working on this company, my partner had already created an LLC, and from a previous startup experience, I did not want to get “burned” again. I&#x27;ve asked him multiple times to add me as a founder, and we should visit a lawyer to create a  Certificate of Organization. However, this was always delayed, he told me he called the company that created the LLC to add me in, nothing has changed. I have a hard time expressing my concerns, and due to previous old trust issues not being addressed, I started to ignore him. So a few months go by, he seems to be doing okay on his own, meanwhile technical debt builds up.<p>Does this fall into the passive-aggressive behavior category? How could I fix this habit? And more importantly, let my partner know that I&#x27;m also trying to understand why I behave in certain ways, subconsciously.\nI still don&#x27;t know why I put up a wall and ignore people, what am I trying to achieve doing that? My Mother tells me I got it from my Father, oh man.",
