      "text": "Due to the controversy around Apple&#x27;s CSAM backdoor plans, it seems like quite a few people are wondering what kind of alternatives are available. Let&#x27;s share them!<p>My choices:<p>- Desktop: Manjaro Gnome, because it feels like macOS. It even does the 3 finger swipe up to see all your apps with Apple&#x27;s Touchpad. My wireless Apple Keyboard also works fine.<p>To install it on my older MacBook Pro from 2014, but I had to use Android internet tethering to install the WiFi driver.\nTo install it on my super new desktop, I had to use an ISO with a newer Kernel (5.13) due to the Radeon 6700 XT graphics card. I got that one from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manjaro&#x2F;release-review&#x2F;releases&#x2F; instead of the Manjaro main website.<p>- Phone: I considered a Pixel with CalyxOS, but ended up buying a OnePlus 8T with microG variant of LineageOS from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lineage.microg.org<p>Alternatively a Pixel phone would also run this version of LineageOS. MicroG (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microg.org&#x2F;) re-implements some parts of Google Play Services, while safeguarding your privacy, like push notifications. It also has some other Google-specific features re-implemented. I have over 40 apps and only found 1 that didn&#x27;t work so far (which is Uber Eats, because they seem to require Google Advertisement ID). I pushed a modified Google Camera app to it (from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.celsoazevedo.com&#x2F;), so my camera is better supported. I think only 3 out of 4 cameras are working, but I don&#x27;t care.<p>- Watch: Amazfit GTR 2e with the official app. Alternatively it should work with Gadgetbridge if you don&#x27;t want to use the offical app (&quot;Zepp&quot;). Amazfit GTR 2 is a better option if you want it to have WiFi and want to store music on it. Alternatives I considered: OnePlus Watch and Fossil Hybrid.<p>Apple features that I gave up:<p>- Apple Carplay: Because I don&#x27;t want to use the Google ecosystem, Android Auto is not an alternative. I&#x27;ll use my car&#x27;s own GPS system, or I&#x27;ll end up using my phone&#x27;s offline maps.<p>- Apple Pay: My bank luckily has a contactless payment app for my phone, but I won&#x27;t be making payments with my watch anymore.",
