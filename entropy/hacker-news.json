      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I am going through a promotion process at work and a large part of the interview process centres around solving the challenges of hybrid working (which in this context means that each team member will spend some days in the office and some WFH). To complicate matters I am based in a different office to the rest of my team so even when I&#x27;m in the office I am working remotely.<p>I&#x27;d like to read some expert insights about how to manage this situation. Can anyone recommend some good books by business leaders or management experts about how to approach management in a remote working or hybrid working environment? I&#x27;m not in a STEM field so it doesn&#x27;t need to focus on STEM (and in fact would rather it is not too closely tied to STEM or any particular industry).<p>Thanks in advance!",
