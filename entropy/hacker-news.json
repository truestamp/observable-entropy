      "text": "I&#x27;ve tried every possible way to contact Uber I can find to only be met with canned answers by what I assume are bots.  I was a victim of this so I know it&#x27;s being exploited by drivers currently.<p>How to assault&#x2F;rob your passengers and not get caught:<p>1. Accept the ride\n2. Meet the passenger and lock then in your car.\n3. Do not start the ride, but instead assault, extort, etc... Your passenger.  \n4. Decline the ride when they flee the car.\n5. Ride is now routed to the next driver.\n6. Profit!!! Because you car and name will never appear in the riders history.  The rider safety hotline does not have the ability to see driver canceled rides.  You cannot open a help case in the app because driver cancelled rides do not appear.  Uber support (if you can get them to respond) do not have the ability to see driver canceled rides.  There is no way to escalate this issue. There&#x27;s no human to talk to about this issue.  You are totally safe to do this with impunity as a driver.<p>For all the tech magic, anything that deviates outside what they have considered as possible leads to a black hole.  How do we contact Uber about this massive exploit before it blows up and tanks their already floundering stock price?",
