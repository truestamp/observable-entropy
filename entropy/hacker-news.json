      "text": "Until recently, i never saw any ads on YT.  This was because of a combination of VPN, strict stealth mode browsing on only YT,and ublock origin no script blocking.  We used to never see ads since YT didnt have a solid enough profile on the user that it could bid out CPM.<p>It seems that recently something has changed since we do now see ads.<p>I dont recall specifically but suspect this happened when youtube started to break if user had all js fully blocked (using uBlock)<p>Are you experiencing the same change?",

      "text": "I bought a $59 USD license for a Windows Desktop program two years ago but did not purchase the optional support at $15&#x2F;year. My PC disk drive crashed and I do not have a backup of the installer for that program. I emailed vendor support and was told my license is perpetual but only for the purchased version and without the support subscription I cannot download the latest version and they do not provide downloads for older versions. It does state in their online support policy that customer is responsible for backing up their installer. So my only recourse is to purchase another license. I guess this is why purchasing support is worth it.<p>Is this normal&#x2F;typical for paid  licensed software?",

      "text": "Hi,<p>this is for everybody who is interested in clean tech, especially real-time automation within new energy systems.<p>We&#x27;ve been working on FlexMeasures for a while ― an energy management system (EMS) with a focus on using demand flexibility to its maximum potential.<p>We&#x27;re running it in several pilots ourselves, but our aim is to speed up the energy transition across the world. Let&#x27;s not re-invent the wheel (i.e. a software stack around time series and optimization) too many times. Wherever you are in the world, and whatever setting you might be looking at (energy-modern housing in the U.S., smart e-mobility in Africa, self-balancing microgrids in Indonesia, etc.), maybe some of you will like our approach.<p>We&#x27;ve decided that making it easy and clear for developers to build such energy solutions can bring the largest gains. The first step towards that goal was a permissive license (Apache 2.0). The latest step we took was a Docker image (we got a Docker-based tutorial here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flexmeasures.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;tut&#x2F;toy-example-from-scratch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flexmeasures.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;tut&#x2F;toy-exampl...</a>).<p>You can see the code at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FlexMeasures&#x2F;flexmeasures\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FlexMeasures&#x2F;flexmeasures</a><p>Since recently, FlexMeasures is a project within the Linux Energy Foundation (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lfenergy.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;flexmeasures&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lfenergy.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;flexmeasures&#x2F;</a>), which helps to establish a proper governance and quality standard.<p>Actually, upcoming Thursday is our next Technical Steering Committee meeting, and interested people are warmly invited:<p>Thursday, June 16 at 8:00 am US Pacific Time &#x2F; 11:00 am US Eastern\ntime &#x2F; 5:00 pm Central European Time<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meet.google.com&#x2F;cyu-inss-oik\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meet.google.com&#x2F;cyu-inss-oik</a><p>We&#x27;d love to hear from you!",
