      "text": "Hey,<p>I don&#x27;t know how common an issue it is, but I figured I would ask.<p>Last year, apart from what I normally do, I ended up taking over release testing for one of our systems. Since I was taking over existing albeit unstructured process, it was not fun since this particular release had multiple broken features, non-working hotfixes.. it was just a mess.. ( and there was no real time to stop and think about setting up a proper structure first ). Now all that is over until next release notes are out, I have some time to think how to do it better and I was curious if I am trying to re-invent the wheel.<p>The short question is:<p>What do you use to track new releases, associated issues, actual testing and results? Are there any best practices you can share?<p>I can tell you what we have right now: multiple spreadsheets, billion emails, docusign and PM, who insists as SME I should be doing most of this stuff anyway ( and tbh -- having seen how it was done so far, maybe it is better I took it over ). If it helps, given the results, there are indications that I will be watching over other system releases as well.<p>Thank you,",
