      "text": "I see all these posts about how much more privacy-focused the EU is vs the US, the GDPR, blah, blah, blah.<p>Yesterday I was going to check out the free 75GB trial of Scaleway&#x27;s S3 service to see how it compared to others.  However, it wouldn&#x27;t let me create a bucket until I gave my credit card info, whereas Backblaze lets a free account use 10GB without giving any credit card.  So I decided to pass on Scaleway.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find the link to delete my account and had to use their online chat service.  The link wasn&#x27;t where they said it was, but I did poke around and find it.  It was very clear that it was going to erase all data about me, referenced &quot;data processors&quot; and &quot;data controllers&quot;, blah, blah, blah.<p>And since then I have received two emails from them encouraging me to try out their service, how to get started, etc.<p>So much for everyone in the EU having control of their data.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m in the US and their fancy, convoluted rules don&#x27;t apply.  Seems like any other company I&#x27;ve dealt with.",
