      "text": "I&#x27;m a Swiss citizen, 38-years old. I&#x27;ve been based out of Southeast Asia for close to ten years. During this time, I&#x27;ve mostly survived on past savings and odd online jobs. However, for various reasons, I&#x27;m no longer able to stay here and have to return to Switzerland.\nI have little financial resources left, so I need a job fast. I will do anything within my capabilities. In the (distant) past, I worked in IT, but my tasks were mostly confined to simple code maintenance &amp; bug fixing. I also dabbled with Ruby on Rails during my free-time. That said, I didn&#x27;t touch code in several years. However, I would be totally willing to try and get back into it, even at minimal pay. I would also consider related jobs, like IT support or DevOps.\nIf anyone has any pointers or tips, that would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks\nSteve",
