      "text": "The background: I split my 30y career half &amp; half between investment banking and startups. Yet I am located in Italy, an area where VC is in its infancy.<p>After having devoted 7 years to my own startup (<i>) I started helping other startups for funding and business development with a few friends. We are all ex bankers with lots of international exposure.<p>We got ourselves a Pitchbook subscription to find intelligence on who was active in the relevant sectors, made sure the pitching material for our first startup was solid (it&#x27;s a world class tool for genetic diagnosis, just confirmed by a US competition where the best global players attended) and started reaching out with the infamous cold emails, with Docsend links.<p>Not that I am particularly good at replying to cold emails, but if they are personal and carefully written I will probably oblige.<p>Yet we basically received one (most likely) automatic answer and a second immediate refusal out of 25&#x2F;30 attempts. One of the two opened the links. Period.<p>What can we do to have reasonable chances to get in touch with relevant people?<p>One thing that we, as a team, ensure, is that we do our work on the &quot;item&quot; that we speak about. Both from the startup side and the candidate investors one.<p>After all if banking teaches you something is that you are supposed to go really deep on the topic if you want to make it work.<p>Thanks for any pointers you might share.<p>(</i>) which has never been able to get funded even if it got a grant and a Seal of Excellence from the most competitive institution in the EU (EIC)",
