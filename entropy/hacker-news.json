I&#x27;m self-taught as a dev, but I&#x27;m considering a degree that would open doors to these types of positions. The degree I&#x27;m considering is Computer Engineering, which is advertised as being a middle layer between EE and CS degrees. I wanted to know if self-teaching is an option before I take on the student loan debt.<p>Are academic credentials&#x2F;internships required for these kinds of jobs?",
