      "text": "Bloomberg Terminal is a widely used financial data provider. Logging in is secured with a password and a 2-FA device. The default option is a small hardware token with a fingerprint sensor. Alternatively, there is an App for Android versions 7.0 and greater. However, there is no such App for Apple devices, however new.<p>Given the size of Bloomberg and the considerable subscription fees, I imagine that this lack of iPhone support must be a consequence of security issues, rather than a lack of organizational &quot;want&quot;.<p>However, every single bank supports 2FA using the iPhone, so there must be a secure way to accomplish that securely. What are the differences between iOS and Android, has something changed with Android v7, and are there implications to not use an iPhone as 2FA-device?",
