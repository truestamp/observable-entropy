      "text": "Is there a line of research that looks into solving difficult &#x2F; intractable problems by finding a mapping that expresses them as different problems that we know how to solve?<p>A fairly surreal and probably overly optimistic example would be, for example, to solve traveling salesman problems using chess engines. What we would need is to find right mappings:\n(1) from a traveling salesman problem to a chess position and,\n(2) from a traveling salesman route to a chess move (or move sequence)<p>A general solution for a &quot;compiler&quot; that can translate between any pair of problems feels unrealistic but I can imagine developing a mapping between, say, a tic tac toe game and simple chess positions where you could:\n(1) translate a tic tac toe position into a chess position\n(2) solve the chess position\n(3) translate the solution into a tic tac toe sequence<p>Any thoughts or pointers to relevant research would be much appreciated!",
