I was thinking: &quot;so, 50 years ago we had this IBM 360 thing, and now we have iPhones that are way more powerful. So, in 50 years would we be able to have a computer that fits in our pocket that has everything needed to deploy Stack Overflow?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure the rack in picture [1] is decent for today&#x27;s standards but I couldn&#x27;t help but think &quot;wow, that rack looks, big, heavy and costly!&quot;.<p>I was thinking about availability, performance, redundancy, security, etc. Do you think it would be possible to host the entire Stack Overflow site in my &quot;2070 mobile phone&quot; and serve with it millions of visitors as performant and secure as the current SO does?<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickcraver.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition&#x2F;<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickcraver.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;content&#x2F;SO-Architecture&#x2F;SO-Architecture-RackB-Bottom.webp",
