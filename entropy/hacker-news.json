What are the worst tech companies to work for? Keep in mind that the meaning of &quot;worst&quot; is relative. For some, a company with a higher pay but a toxic work environment is the worst. For others, it&#x27;s the contrary (i.e. a company with a sane environment but shitty pay).<p>Name and shame.",
