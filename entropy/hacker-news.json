      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;ve created a frontend search engine to search through SMBC Comics[0]. There was no index, so I created a program that uses OpenCV EAST and Tesseract to extract text and other metadata from all 6000+ comics. A challenge that I came across is that the data that is being searched is imperfect (OCR isn&#x27;t the best with handwritten-esque text). Search is done in the frontend with Fuse.js[1].<p>The comics are available to search at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sambhavsaggi.github.io&#x2F;comic-fulltext-search&#x2F;<p>Currently, it&#x27;s a little slow since it has to search through megabytes of text in the browser, but response times are all less than 1.5 seconds on my laptop (your mileage may vary).<p>Some things I could use assistance on include improved text extraction from comics and faster&#x2F;better search (maybe in WASM?)<p>---<p>The code for this project is available here:<p>Frontend: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sambhavsaggi&#x2F;comic-fulltext-search<p>Text extractor: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sambhavsaggi&#x2F;comic-ocr<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smbc-comics.com<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fusejs.io&#x2F;<p>---<p>Thanks!<p>ET",
