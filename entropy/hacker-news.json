      "text": "Hi,<p>I am new to the world of web3 and have been trying to figure out how to create a fully distributed system where large amount of json objects need to be stored and queried.<p>I recognize that the data can be stored on IPFS but I think I need do run webservers (nodejs&#x2F;express) to keep the data in memory and handle queries effectively.<p>How do you go about maintaining various node servers in a web3 setup? I cannot be the owner of these servers as that would be a point of failure…<p>I checked the Graph potentially for indexing but as far as I understand it is mainly useful if the data is somehow linked to smart contracts.<p>I’d be grateful for any guidance you might have.<p>Thanks",
