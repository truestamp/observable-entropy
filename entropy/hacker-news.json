My migraine problems have gotten to a point where I feel like I&#x27;m using too much medication for my own good. A lot of its causes seem almost unavoidable due to screen uses, for my job.<p>What are alternative career options for someone like me?<p>- almost no experience with anything outside of software engineering and a little bit of teaching<p>- physically quite weak (5&#x27;8&quot;, 120 lbs) and can&#x27;t lift very much, also approaching 40 years old<p>- outdoors or at least anything that doesn&#x27;t involve looking at a screen, even if indoors<p>- have a 3 year old at home so jobs that require traveling very much is not really an option<p>I know it&#x27;s probably unrealistic to find an alternative job that pays nearly as much as a software dev, but what are any options at all?",
