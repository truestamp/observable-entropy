      "text": "Hi HN, we&#x27;re Nikhil and Dhurv, founders of Flurri (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flurriapp.com&#x2F;icycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flurriapp.com&#x2F;icycle</a>). We’re very excited to launch Flurri (www.flurriapp.com&#x2F;icycle), a platform to help teams build meaningful connections and create an inclusive, engaging culture.<p>From our own experiences and countless others, we know that starting in a new team can be isolating and remote work is lonely. However, the workplace is a great place to make new connections and build bonds, especially as other community institutions (sports clubs, volunteering, etc.) have declined in prominence.<p>We wanted to make it easier and more comfortable to get to know your colleagues, focusing on what makes us all human! We capture a bit about your hobbies and interests, and provide a way for you to search against it, learning more about your co-workers in the process.<p>Communities create profiles built on hobbies, interests, and short ice breakers and we create a searchable internal database of employees based on hobbies, interests, etc. Additionally, users can set up Icycle, our product to match co-workers based on mutual interests on a regular cadence, with meeting invites sent directly.<p>We are completely free to use, so feel free to jump in - creating a profile takes 5 min!<p>We believe work is a great place to find your community, and we want to make it simple, easy, and fun to do that. We appreciate your support and feedback and look forward to hearing your thoughts as we continue to build!",
