      "text": "I am in second year studying Economics and am looking into options for when I graduate. The typical roles for Economics tend to be in banking, finance and consulting. However, I think that I could develop a better career and be far happier in the tech industry. I am not that interested in going down a super technical route involving software development so this post is me trying to work out what other options are available.<p>So far I have really enjoyed microeconomics, environmental economics, finance (I like the concepts, not the idea of the finance industry), statistics, data science and policy issues. I know this is quite broad, but this is why I am trying to explore different options.<p>I would be very interested in hearing peoples experiences, and seeing what roles are out there for a non-technical role at large, medium and start-up companies.<p>What are my options?",

A distro that is _worry free_ and that _just works_.\nWhy do you think that is the case? Or am I simply ignorant of the current state of Linux distros?",
