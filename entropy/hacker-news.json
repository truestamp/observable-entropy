      "text": "Background: We currently use Argo Workflows to orchestrate end-to-end integration tests.<p>Basically, a set of workflow definitions define containers for all the apps that the tests need (typically 7-8 microservice apps, plus services like databases, caches, etc.). Then the last step of the workflow runs test.<p>The downside is that the workflow needs to duplicate the Kubernetes config that we already deploy with ArgoCD. We keep apps, tests, and ArgoCD definitions in separate repos, and this stuff gets out of sync.<p>Plus, Argo Workflows is not so great. Poor UI, very flaky, relatively slow, and of course everything is YAML, which is horrible to work with.<p>Is there anything better?",

      "text": "Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?<p>Background: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn&#x27;t written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and&#x2F;or integrity of customer data via a popular package&#x2F;dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).<p>A few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can&#x27;t &quot;takeover&quot; a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread &#x2F; process. Interested in your thoughts.",
