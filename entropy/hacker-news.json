      "text": "Hello everyone,\nI&#x27;m a Product guy, and I know to code. I&#x27;ve been working in the European tech scene for seven years. It&#x27;s pretty exciting, but I want to set up my own company. First, as a side project, why not work full-time on it when it generates some revenue.\nI don&#x27;t want to build a unicorn; I want to bootstrap my company and be independent. \nI have some pain points I can solve for myself, but I don&#x27;t believe they would generate revenue. Ideally, I would love to work on a specific niche with an intense pain point. But I have some difficulties finding those particular niches.\nWhat&#x27;s your process for starting a new business?",
