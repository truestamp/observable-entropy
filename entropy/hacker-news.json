      "text": "A few days ago, I was in the lobby of my hotel on a Greek island. A woman was at the front desk very upset about having not been upgraded. She was yelling at the staff and causing a real scene. She left with everyone visibly shaken.  Chatting with them a little after, this sounds like an all too common scene.<p>This morning, as promised, a 1 star rating shows up on every review platform. She claims the hotel is ugly, the staff was rude and racist, and even that someone had pushed her.<p>Everything about this claim is a lie. My partner and have been here 4 days and everything has been fantastic. Every single person on the staff goes out of their way to be helpful and the property is beautiful.<p>Looking more at their reviews online, there are a handful of 1 star reviews with some crazy claims. One even looks to have photoshopped an image to make the pool appear dirty. Almost every 1 star review mentioned not being upgraded.<p>I&#x27;ve become especially sensitive to this after listing a property on Airbnb last year. Almost all guests and reviews are wonderful, thoughtful comments about my home and it&#x27;s location. But then occasionally get a 3 star review with an explanation of something like &quot;the dryer vent had lint in it&quot;. Come on...you&#x27;re staying in a cabin in the woods, not the St Regis.<p>As a business owner and a technologist, I feel a ton of empathy for people that have it all on the line and can be so vulnerable. How can rating systems better account for&#x2F;normalize against this kind of behavior?",
