So linkedin have much to gain from showing you candidates who look good on paper but who are not that likely to answer, does my train of thought make sense to you?<p>I&#x27;m also maybe thinking of a tool using the same concept but for your own employees, so you can know which employees are likely to quit and really need to get a raise&#x2F;promotion if you want to keep them.<p>Do you think those might be interesting ideas?",
