It&#x27;s pretty exciting, but I want to set up my own company. First, as a side project, why not work full-time on it when it generates some revenue.\nI don&#x27;t want to build a unicorn; I want to bootstrap my company and be independent.<p>I have some pain points I can solve for myself, but I don&#x27;t believe they would generate revenue. Ideally, I would love to work on a specific niche with an intense pain point. But I have some difficulties finding those particular niches.<p>What&#x27;s your process for starting a new business?",
