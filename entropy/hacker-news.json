They enjoy swimming and are starting to pick up some skills.<p>So my question is: what things have you signed your kids up to, and what was successful and why?<p>I&#x27;d like them to have lots of experiences so they can discover what they enjoy, but there is a limit to the number of things they can try.  I know they are very young now, but time goes by quickly and I want to be prepared.<p>I&#x27;m considering more sports, but also music or dance classes.  There are also non-physical things like chess club to consider as they get a bit older.",
