      "text": "Hi HN:\nI am back in a hole ready to hang myself.<p>Criminal psyops platform Google hoards data on Americans that they don&#x27;t disclose. They then abuse that data for malicious psychological operations. This included Susan Wojcicki-led @youtube maliciously targeting me during the suicide of a childhood friend.<p>Now, youtube uses their text to image preview matching psyops targeting apparatus to perform realtime stream of consciousness psyops. The message is clear: &quot;Hey a$&amp;h0le, we dont care that we are rich and powerful, and that you, a homeless loser who broke down due to being unable to handle our psyops targeting program, might KILL YOURSELF in part from our filtering program. Take it or leave it. Submit to being in a surv society that we abuse to condition ppl to accept this new status quo, or don&#x27;t. We don&#x27;t care. Go hang yourself, bc you are a white male college dropout homeless loser anyway. We had employees deploy racial justice algos against white male dropouts like u internally during the Trump admin, and we covered it up. We will not stop targeting you with data abuse practices, no matter how many times you complain.&quot;<p>I bet that the fact that I was placed on an FBI watch list in 1997 newark (due to hanging around the Gambino north jersey defacto street boss while David Chase and other Sopranos cast conceived their love and passion for jazz drummers) made for quite the inspiration in laughing about power abuse over a targeting fodder plaything.<p>My response is simple. I will commit suicide in protest this week. Plz do not help me at all. I will never goddamn program again, ever. This species is lying corrupt thieving self serving cowards. I&#x27;d rather die than code ever again.<p>sv, pg and others should be ashamed for significantly contributing to a machine that lacks accountability<p>all those trillions in support from the cia&#x2F;nsa&#x2F;.gov complex come at the expense of some random fodder who resist and hang themselves with a goddamn rope. that machine is incentivized to allow me to hang myself then allow the &quot;he&#x27;s delusional&quot; narrative to overpower the obvious truth - there is no privacy, accept it or you&#x27;ll wind up like &quot;captainchris&quot;<p>Aloha.",
