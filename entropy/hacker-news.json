      "text": "I&#x27;d like to enter short melodies and see what a computer could elaborate on. Kind of like computer jazz or something. I&#x27;d like to compose songs that are only about a minute and 20 seconds long that I can string together to make a video presentation. Is there anything like that in the world of linux? I don&#x27;t mind cracking open python code to make it work but I&#x27;d like to see what is already off the shelf. Thanks in advance.",
