      "text": "I recently started working at a company where the development team is very large. A few team members go a lot faster than the other team members, which pressures the team to speed up. The few that do everything really quick are already on the team for more than three years and know all the ins and outs. The vibe in general seems to be that these are the only “senior” team members although they aren’t officially in the lead. How should I deal with this situation?",
