      "text": "Hello HN !<p>My name is Satyam, i am a french startup founder (currently building a pos for restaurant), localized in The Caribbean and was struggling centralizing all brand and design assets to communicate with contractors, PR execs, collaborators and partners.<p>In fact, In the same day, my Sales guys ask me for an email template for prospecting, marketing agencies i was putting in competition asked me a ton of details on my branding that i HAVE but takes couple of hours to search, format and send, i have noticed also that my dev made subtle colors variations of red through our app on the different buttons,...  I have searched for a dead simple tool for centralizing, in an effective way and sharing brand assets and i finish by building it myself. think about the &quot;Design &#x2F; Brand guidelines&quot; section of big internet brands websites,  i was searching for an online creator for that kind of pages.<p>Every tool i have found was big BAM (Brand Assets Management) tools for big corps, or arty tools by and for designers. Not the startup founder &#x2F; CEO &#x2F; CMO &#x2F; PM dedicated tool i was searching for.<p>So after 2 weeks of coding here is bwandy. I will be very pleased to have some descent feedback to know if i was the only one to have the problem. You can sign up free without credit cart (find the corresponding link in the start trial page). Thanks you a lot guys !!",
