The first two weeks of vacation I felt great since I had a stressful month before this but that feeling has gone away now. Instead, I just feel unmotivated to do anything except watch TV all day. I do exercise and cook but that&#x27;s about it. I think I realized the schedule that I was following kept me sane even though it was also stressing me out.",
