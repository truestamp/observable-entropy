Let us also assume equal soft skills and equivalent expertise (meaning, a wordpress developer is as good at wordpress as a GoLang developer is at Golang). Same for domain knowledge.<p>Given everything else is equal, what tech skill would you pick to earn the maximum? Both as a freelancer and as a full time employee?<p>In other words, what skill has paid you the most?<p>I am asking because I am sick of being poor and of doing the same CRUD apps over and over again. I am experimenting with a few skillsets to pick from - being interested in the skillset is obviously the first item on the list, closely followed by the pay.",
