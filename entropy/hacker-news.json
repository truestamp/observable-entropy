      "text": "I would like a tool which takes code in a javascript project and generates markdown where the comments are taken as direct markdown and the code is wrapped in triple backticks. This would allow me to make a blog post from a javascript project without maintaining two separate files and updating the code in both.<p>For example if I have this in a javascript file:<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;*\n  # Tutorial Title\n\n  Welcome to the codebase tutorial.\n\n  ## Add Function\n\n  This function is used to add numbers. `1+2=3` is an example of some backquoted text.\n  *&#x2F;\n  function add(a,b) {\n    return a + b;\n  }\n\n  &#x2F;*\n  ## Subtract Function\n\n  This function is used to subtract! ***Use at your own risk***\n  *&#x2F;\n  function subtract(a,b) {\n    return a - b;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI would like the resulting markdown to be:<p><pre><code>  # Tutorial Title\n\n  Welcome to the codebase tutorial.\n\n  ## Add Function\n\n  This function is used to add numbers. `1+2=3` is an example of some backquoted text.\n  ```\n  function add(a,b) {\n    return a + b;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ## Subtract Function\n\n  This function is used to subtract! ***Use at your own risk***\n  ```\n  function subtract(a,b) {\n    return a - b;\n  }\n  ```\n</code></pre>\nDoes anyone know of a tool which will do this?",
