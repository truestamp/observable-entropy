      "text": "Dear HN,<p>I have the opportunity to move from Berlin to Princeton, NJ, in relation to my wife&#x27;s job.\nI wonder if it makes sense financially and I thought to ask the community.<p>A bit of context: I turned 50 this year, I have 25+ years of coding&#x2F;system design&#x2F;tech lead experience. I have mostly worked as a freelance &quot;on-site&quot;, sometimes for short periods of time, some other times I stayed with the same client for years.<p>These days I work on a lot of cloud migration projects, with a strong focus on AWS.<p>So, coming to my question, I have no frame of reference regarding salaries on the East Coast, especially for freelance jobs.<p>I did some research and the salaries for permanent positions in the area are significantly lower than my current income in Europe. I assume that I could potentially earn more by engaging clients on the west coast, but my US network is non existent.<p>Is the free-lancing that I&#x27;m used to do in Europe even a thing in the US? (Working for a client for months - at least 6 - on a daily rate which is higher than a normal salary because I can be released  at any time plus I bear all the cost of employment including health).\nAlso, can my age represent a problem for employers?<p>Sorry for the fuzziness of the question, I hope it does make some sense.",
