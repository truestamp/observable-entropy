      "text": "I want to know if you agree or disagree with my claim that developer skill is similar to strength or fitness. There is no such thing as &quot;specialist&quot; developers. Someone who is an amazing kernel hacker is most likely also very good at writing Haskell software or Javascript code for websites. The kernel hacker may not know Haskell but could pick up the language in a few weeks and then be productive with it. Conversely, someone who is weak in Javascript is likely also weak in C.<p>Like fitness. If you can run a marathon you will outperform me, who can barely run one kilometer, on almost any physical activity. Whether it be running, biking, playing football, tennis, boxing, etc. Perhaps in some sports I would have an edge by knowing technique or tactics, but in most your superior fitness would be decisive.<p>I also think using terms like strong and weak developer is less stigmatizing than good and bad developer. You can get physical strength by lifting weights and developer strength by hacking a lot. My strongest colleagues debugged any system with equal ease; Erlang, Bash, C, Javascript, CSS, you name it. My weakest struggled with all languages and systems. Just my observations from years of work...",
