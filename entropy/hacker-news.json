      "text": "*<i>I am looking for a co-founder*</i>.<p>Hello everyone! Briefly. I have been working with companies for a long time and I feel that sending emails in &quot;letter format&#x27; sometimes makes no sense and is an obsolete system.<p>My point of view is that, in most cases, we build trust with our client, and instead of sending mails, we send audios via WhatsApp. In addition, many times the texts are misinterpreted and need to be clarified to avoid misunderstandings.<p>At least in Latin America it is very common.<p>That is why I am working on this idea, which would be an app like Gmail, but that allows you to send audios like WhatsApp, becoming the standard for companies.<p>What do you think? Would you use it?<p>If anyone wants to chat, I&#x27;ll pass you my email (although it would be nice to have invented the app already! Haha).<p>Greeting and thanks.<p>Nicolás",
