      "text": "I started work at FAANG recently and was rather surprised by the amount of non-programming : programming ratio. There are full days where I don&#x27;t open my text editor. There are probably weeks I don&#x27;t.<p>I know that programming isn&#x27;t all there is to the job, and the more you grow, the more time you spend on architecture design, research, etc. I&#x27;m not talking about that at all.<p>I&#x27;m talking about endless, menial click-this-then-click that, navigate through 30 poorly-maintained web interfaces, open a ticket in the goo-experience team, reach out to John Doe on the fudge team, read 2 hours worth of obsolete, hastily-written documentation to try to guess what needs to be done.<p>That is the core of my job, and by speaking to people in different orgs, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m far from alone.<p>My theory is that this kind of work, while boring and non-developer related, is necessary and there are incentives to hire a developer to do them (managers get to manage an additional developer). However, someone must be doing the coding somewhere. I&#x27;d like to find out the proportion between these two groups.",

      "text": "Greetings HNers,<p>I’ve recently picked up a new hobby and have been struggling to find resources for getting started and contextualizing the hobby. Everything jumps into technique whereas I don’t even know the who, what, when, where, why.<p>Im therefore thinking of making a simple FAQ website for this topic. These FAQs would be fairly detailed (more than just question and one sentence answer), but I don’t envision it as an ongoing blog: more just a static page of common questions and resources for someone starting out.<p>Can you suggest any websites that have a well designed “static but verbose FAQ” layout?",
