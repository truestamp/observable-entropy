(This may sound stupid, but I&#x27;m going to ask anyway)<p>It would be great if you share your thoughts from builder&#x27;s POV and consumer POV?",

A site with no &quot;real&quot; database (just a json file I update by hand), no email signups, no ads, no pop ups, no data collection (besides google analytics), and no comment section filled with highly polarized politics. A site updated only 1-2 times per week.<p>It&#x27;s just unique information in a simple and accessible format. The goal is for people to <i>not</i> check veryLA every day. I don&#x27;t want people hitting refresh for emotionally charged SEO packed news to react to. My goal is for people to check out veryLA 1-2 per week and then go into the real world and have fun with the information they found.<p>Hope you enjoy if you live in Los Angeles or are planning to visit!",
