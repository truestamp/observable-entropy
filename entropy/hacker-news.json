      "text": "I recently started to notice how more and more videos in the results of a YouTube search have absolutely nothing to do with the search term. It looks like these videos are injected recommendations based on watch behaviour or even just trending videos.<p>Here is a real example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Vu9V6jg.png<p>First two videos are relevant to the search, third is relevant to my other watch interests and fourth just seems to be a trending video. This is AFTER already filtering out all the &quot;Similar videos&quot; or &quot;Recommended for you&quot; shelves that are normally also present in search results.<p>The frustrating thing is that these videos don&#x27;t seem to have any distinguishing attributes, classes or tags that could be used to build a uBlock filter. I&#x27;ve even tried to see if there is any data in the requested JS that could help indicate if a video is injected, but no luck so far.<p>Has anyone had any success filtering out this crap?",
