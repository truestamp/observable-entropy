      "text": "Due to the recent Play Store changes you can no longer &quot;add text or images that indicate store performance or ranking, or suggest relations to existing Google Play programs in the app title&quot; [1].\nYou can&#x27;t, for example, add &quot;#1&quot;, &quot;best&quot; or &quot;free&quot;. However, you can&#x27;t also add &quot;no ads&quot;.<p>To be precise: appending &quot;[small, no ads]&quot;, &quot;[no ads]&quot; or &quot;[without ads]&quot; to the play store app title causes a rejection. I didn&#x27;t want to test more in fear of banning, and in the end removed it.\nI know you can see if an app contains ads in the app page, but not in the search results... or at least not yet, but I doubt Google will add that indication.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;googleplay&#x2F;android-developer&#x2F;answer&#x2F;9898684",
