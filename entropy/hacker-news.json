Do binaries even <i>need</i> a license?\nTo me one thing that <i>would</i> make it require a license is the &quot;non-commercial use&quot;.\nAnother thing might be that I want people to be able to use it, and sometimes the absence of a license, the legal uncertainty that brings, is inhibitive.<p>Any advice, discussion or links are very much appreciated.",
