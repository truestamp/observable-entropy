On the backend we&#x27;re using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We&#x27;re looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps&#x27;y stuff sometimes (because in a way it&#x27;s the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you&#x27;d have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, or SaltStack.<p>Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have multiple happy and satisfied clients.\nWe promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don’t give us a business advantage, as well as sane working hours. We’ve got investment days on Fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.<p>If that sounds like fun to you, apply at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spacelift.recruitee.com&#x2F; or email me at magdalenaw at spacelift dot io!",
