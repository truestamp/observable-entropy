      "text": "Hi HN Crowd,<p>Same as other companies we are moving into a hybrid work environment.<p>Here some things we are looking for:\n- people in the room should be able to collaborate with people who are at home. All looking at the same content simultaneously while video conferencing\n- everyone should be able participate actively (drawing)\n- ideally in the room this happens on a big screen in the room<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen so far:\n- solutions like Samsung flip2 seem to be only made for collaboration with people in the same room\n- pure whiteboarding SAAS Tools don&#x27;t always work with available big touchscreens (browser compatibility, etc.). Or you will have to run a dedicated PC that is connected to the screen.\n- mirroring an iPad that lies on the meeting room table might be an option, but then it has to be passed around to draw<p>What are your best setups for this or similar use cases that you&#x27;ve found?<p>Thanks!",
