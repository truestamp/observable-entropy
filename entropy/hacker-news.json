Any idea how it got there?<p>1. Searched for it via DuckDuckGo, in safari on OS X. (Signed into Instagram on that browser, and fake Facebook account which shares no info with said Instagram. Fake facebook account signed in on same iPhone as Instagram.\n2. Instagram and fake Facebook settings have fully disabled all tracking and ad personalisation settings that are possible.\n3. I actively engage ads I don’t care about, and often receive ads for COMPLETELY irrelevant things, I find this fun.<p>How did within a matter of hours this HMI end up on my Insta feed, I’m sure I’m missing something obvious… surely not cookies…<p>Someone shared, or bled data.\n4d systems webpage? Likely - but they don’t know anything about me… AdGuard and safari - couldn’t be a cookie?\nduckduckgo? Doubt it\nSafari? I thought safari blocked cross site tracking?",
