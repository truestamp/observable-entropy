      "text": "I have been trying to learn some insights into UX and product management. Yet, the more I read the more I am concluding that they are rationalizations people use to justify the existence of their roles after the fact.<p>For example, most PM books offer very general advice and patterns, not specific or concrete examples. These books go on and on telling the same superficial knowledge.<p>My hypothesis is that most people got their careers out of sheer luck, but later justify their successes as &quot;hard work&quot; and create a story to sell themselves as &quot;changing the world&quot;. \n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Choice-supportive_bias<p>Does anyone feel that a lot of jobs are bs, (well) paid by the rich to stroke their egos, keep their privilege, and prolong self-perpetuating lies? Or that most &quot;professionals&quot; are just bsing their way through life without even knowing it and feel proud about it?\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30215033",
