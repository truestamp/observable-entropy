So to try and figure out how we were going to change the world, we said to each other: “Let’s Ketchup”.\nSo we decided to “ketchup” regularly with the goal to change the world. We set ourselves some rituals and commitments as part of our ketchup (mainly just for fun, first). Over time, we iterated on our process and our ketchup developed and evolved.\nNow, after 3017920 minutes (over 40 “ketchups”), AND each of us moving countries&#x2F;timezones multiple times.\nWe always made it happen We always made it meaningful\nIn the last year and a half, we have also started having regular ketchups with other groups of friends with different goals, some as simple as “just to stay in touch”. And again, we have found that with these other friends we also managed to ketchup and:\nAlways make it happen Always make it meaningful\nFinally, as self-proclaimed “energy engineers”, we realized we really know how to “ketchup”. We know how to make it happen and make it meaningful, and now we are looking forward to sharing our secrets… and finally “Change the World”.",
