After placing the ad, I was immediately told, that the company can never post ads again without explanation.<p>After signing up to Stripe, verifying with my passport and selfies, they told me that the business account will be closed, stating they&#x27;ve &quot;identified a high volume of unauthorized charges on your account&quot;. There have been NO charges on that account.<p>Twitter also blocked my account there shortly after creating it.<p>Do you have any idea what might be causing this? It feels like because I&#x27;ve had no public profile on the internet ever, I am being penalised for finally having to join to market my business.",
