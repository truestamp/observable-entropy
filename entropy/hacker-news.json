I want to get him a starting programming kit of sorts. Myself I started with a ZX Spectrum clone, that came with a booklet with some stuff I could do with the computer. So I was thinking to get him something like a RPI with a keyboard and preinstalled dev environment he can play with. Anything like that?<p>I don&#x27;t have lots of time atm to do it myself, thus I&#x27;m looking for an already made solution.",
