      "text": "The following advice is often said by developers:<p><i>If your code is meant to be read by other developers, then no matter how experienced you are a programmer, your code should be so simple and clear that even a junior programmer can understand it.</i><p>This belief or advice is often repeated in articles and in comments on forums like HN.<p>But is this a belief that everyone agrees? Or is it a belief few programmers practice in real life?<p>What are the examples of medium-sized (or larger) open-source projects written in simple and clear code suitable for programmers of all levels to understand? Are there standard libraries that meet this criteria?<p>In contrast, programmers often confess that [insert framework here] is full of &#x27;magic&#x27;. I&#x27;ve even read complaints from developers that some SSGs (static site generators) are the opposite of simplicity of when reading the code. Does this suggest that &#x27;magic&#x27; is actually the more common scenario among programmers?<p>Could it be that the experienced programmer avoids writing code at a junior-level comprehension because of the gaze and (silent) judgment of their colleagues?<p>Your thoughts?",
