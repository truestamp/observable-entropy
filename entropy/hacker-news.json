      "text": "My daughter will graduate next year and, having always been technically inclined, has indicated that she would like to pursue a career in some aspect of the technical industry. I think this is wonderful.\nHowever, having recognized the importance of your industry tragically late I feel like I am letting her down when she wants to discuss specifics, i.e. What do I think about the future of AI, which programming languages will remain relevant etc.\nI&#x27;ve started to regularly read here (often with a search page pulled up to research some of the terminology) and have begun subscribing to newsletters etc, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone resources or pages they would recommend to help me better educate myself in her chosen field of interest. I am not seeking to be an expert, but I would love to be a somewhat informed sounding board as she switches into adulthood.",
