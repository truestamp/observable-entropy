      "text": "Software development in most startup teams today has become ticket-driven development. The PM&#x2F;EM writes a bunch of poorly detailed tickets (often with no detail) and expects devs to deliver on them. Is this the situation in your team too? If there is detail, it&#x27;s usually a few hastily written lines in the JIRA ticket description with the rest left to the developer to figure out, fill in the blanks on, or ask questions around.<p>1. have you experienced this? and if so, have you seen that this leads to poorer quality deliverables or does it not have any impact?<p>2. what would you fix about this process (systems, people, tools) to make it better?",
