      "text": "Hello HN:<p>Here is the link https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1579078660<p>After forgetting to turn off a p2.xlarge instance for a week, I got so mad at myself I learnt swiftUI to build a native macOS console for most of the actions I do on the web AWS console. I didnt want to use electron or other non native frameworks.<p>Most importantly I just wanted it to know how much a certain instance costs right now, no matter its state, its type, its lifecycle(like ondemand or spot) and the costs associated with the EBS volumes attached including their IOPS&#x2F;throughput and etc.<p>It also has a S3 object browser, and a drag and drop UI to upload your files so that you can make S3 your own personal dropbox.<p>I dont track or store anything, you just query the aws api.<p>Sorry its a paid app, if anyone wants to try it and cant afford it let me know, I can send it to you. I think this can be useful and cost saving for individuals that spend more than 50usd per month on aws.",
