In the 83(b) form they included a restriction as follows:<p>4. The property is subject to the following restrictions: The company may repurchase at cost all or a portion of the shares upon termination of employment or services of the Taxpayer.<p>Am I reading this correctly that this is a non-terminating clawback whereas they could basically state at any time that I no longer provide them services and they could force me to sell those shares at cost?",
