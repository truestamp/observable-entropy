      "text": "&quot;How do I hire the right tech talent for my startup?&quot;\nThis is the most common question pitched to me during my discussions with fellow founders, especially the non-tech founders:<p>Here are my thoughts:<p>1. Hire for your tech-stack<p>Don&#x27;t rely on the hiring style of FAANG. Realise that FAANG hires people to solve complex technical challenges and they invest in training their engineers, before onboarding them on any project. Startups are different.\nIn 99% of the cases, you aren&#x27;t hiring to solve an unheard technical problem. All you want is a good programmer who can start contributing ASAP. So hire someone that resonates with the skills of your existing tech stack.\nThe whole notion that a good engineer can quickly learn a new framework&#x2F;language is misleading. Sure you can learn the basics of JAVA in probably a couple of weeks&#x27; time, but getting mastery over it is years of effort. The latter is what you call a 10x engineer.<p>2. Go beyond CS&#x2F;IT pedigree<p>I find it hard to search for any reason why a degree in CS&#x2F;IT would be required for building the tech. With the abundance of resources on the internet, there isn&#x27;t any barrier to entry in the field of programming. I personally have interacted with many self-taught coders who have amazed me with their breadth of knowledge.<p>3. Tap into your network<p>Early-stage companies don&#x27;t need a full-time software architect. Tap into your network and ask help for to review your system design. Ideally, these people should themselves had build a system from scratch, they will be able to help you the most. Once a quarter review is more than enough early on.<p>For founders in my network who are looking to get their system design and security review, I&#x27;d be more than happy to help to the best of my ability. Feel free to reach out.",
