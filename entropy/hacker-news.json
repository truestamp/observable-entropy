      "text": "Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and video game companies like King (makers of candy crush) make their money by getting us to spend as much time as possible on their products.<p>They spend millions working out how best to pull you into their products, and to keep you scrolling and crushing candies once you’re in.<p>I believe the addictive nature of these apps is causing an existential crisis. People are no longer achieving goals aligned with their values — and, since this technology allows no time for introspection — may even not know their values.<p>This was certainly true for me.<p>So I’d love to hear what acts of resistance (or productivity hacks) you’ve engaged in to help yourself avoid these apps.",

Meanwhile, the vaccine is in short supply in much of Africa, and the rate of vaccination is quite low in much of Africa.
