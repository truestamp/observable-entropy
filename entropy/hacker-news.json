      "text": "Hi,<p>I have helped architect embedded vision system.<p>It&#x27;s a piece of hardware with a camera, AI accelerator, processor, RT processor etc.<p>A lot of stuff is going on in this project, also a lot have changed in last just year.<p>It was easy for me to do the first diagrams in Keynote and present the architecture.<p>But now it grew so much, that I no longer feel control over it.<p>I get a lot of feature requests and questions about system behaviour, and it takes me longer and longer to respond.<p>Is there any software that could really help write down, visualise and keep history of such architecture?<p>Ideally I could contribute on pieces of it with teammates.<p>How would you approach such problem?<p>thanks.",
