      "text": "I am not sure why I was permanently banned from reddit and the subreddit R&#x2F;relationship advice and I keep getting hate comments every time I post about my issues with dating and being single. I even received hateful messages because I do not want to date a single dad.  In addition, I tried to reach out to the mods, but they did nothing but banned me again from another account. They made an excuse and I asked why I was banned from subreddit and reddit. I deleted the accounts. Despite the fact that I did nothing wrong, they kept banning my account. I make a lot of questions and I always delete them. How is this not spam?",
