      "text": "I recently started a new job (Full-Stack Dev). On a project where I am one of three developers I am consistently seeing bad practices from the other developers that are leading to too many unnecessary bugs.<p>These developers are considered to be more senior than me so a lot of my suggestions are not taken into consideration. Sometimes when reviewing code after it has been merged (code review is not something the other developers want to do), I spot issues that frustrate me because it will end up causing problems in the future.<p>On the other hand, because they are used to slow development from of all the productivity issues caused by this, I don&#x27;t have a heavy workload.<p>I am considering taking another full-time contractor role at the same time since I am quite a bit more productive and my code generally has less issues.<p>Basically, if I can just learn to not care about the success of the project, I can do very well for myself financially. I just happen to care too much about the project.",
