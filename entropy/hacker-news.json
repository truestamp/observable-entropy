Our beta is available for both iOS and Android. For this version (which we are calling - P.C. Sorkar, as an ode to one of India&#x27;s OG magicians) you can search mobile screenshots, tag them, delete them and share them. The app is free for upto 200 of your latest screenshots.<p>Ask: What can we do better? What features would you like to see on the next release?<p>Much love, Team Jaadoo.",
