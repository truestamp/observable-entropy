      "text": "Hey HN. I&#x27;m new to the Bay Area and here for half a year for an internship at a tech company (currently doing masters in EU). Looking to meet some cool people around here but other than some of the other interns + my housemate its been a little hard getting an intro. Meetups seem to be pretty scarce on meetup.com and the only other events thing I&#x27;ve found is via the bay area&#x2F;SF discord, but that seems to be pretty biased toward SF. Would love to meet some cool people around here (in tech or otherwise) but it seems meetups have died down a little w.r.t threads from a couple years ago. I figured there&#x27;s a good amount of locals here, any good tips? Thanks!",

      "text": "I am a former FANG software engineer who left his job a few months ago to take a sabbatical.<p>I have always wanted to do a startup but recently I am opening up to the idea of joining a startup. Primarily because :-<p>1. Through working for a few years I now know some promising early startups run by people I like &amp; respect<p>2. I would learn from them and would get to build a lot<p>3. Have some structure in life, the problem statement would be decided and early on I can be pure execution as I increase ownership<p>4. They&#x27;re in a space that I am interested in but don&#x27;t understand, so would learn about the domain name.<p>At the same side on the startup side<p>1. I don&#x27;t have a co-founder<p>2. I have ideas that I am interested in but I don&#x27;t have something that I want to commit 10 years to. I have some ideas in which I see quick revenue but don&#x27;t see them IPO&#x27;ing while others are bigger longer term but seem like a struggle to start.<p>3. If things work out the financial upside is massive compared to an early employee. At seed &#x2F; series A startups I&#x27;d have to be lucky to get anything over a few percentage points of equity.<p>Overall, when I had joining big tech (or a hedge-fund), startup or starting one as options the first option &quot;big tech&quot; seemed like the easiest thing to do. Now joining one seems like the easiest thing to do.",
