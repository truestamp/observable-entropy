      "text": "I noticed that a lot of people love &quot;little nice things&quot; in macOS[1] and other Apple software. Things that will not get noticed in a big splashy release. Sometimes, most users don&#x27;t even notice the attention to details and work that went into making things work nicely.<p>I work on UIs too but in our organization nobody really cares about nice little things. It&#x27;s all about launching and making a new big product or release. I have been in many big tech companies and most of them are like this. Apple is special. Somehow their culture allows obsessing over details.<p>If your organization is successful in rewarding craftsmanship, can you share how they do it?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31315644",

Just let it die.<p>3. Other tech (like, RDF) already tried to claim the term “web 3,” years ago. Trying to snarf it isn&#x27;t even original.<p>4. Aspiring to be “web 3” is euphoria. It&#x27;s delusional. The web is a monster success. Almost nothing in krypto compares.<p>When people talk about crypto or web3 what they usually mean is P2P. Just say it if that&#x27;s what you mean.",
