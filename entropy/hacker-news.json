      "text": "According to TC [0] placer.ai collects data from 40% of iPhone and 60% of Android users in the US via its SDK! How are they encouraging top apps to install their location tracking SDK? Is this some sort of hidden library that gets auto-included via something like CocoaPods [1]? Or maybe they partner with an ad platform and include their SDK as part of theirs? Still neither one of these really explain how they can have such high penetration.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;04&#x2F;27&#x2F;location-data-analytics-startup-placer-ai-raises-50m-series-b&#x2F;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guides.cocoapods.org&#x2F;using&#x2F;the-podfile.html",
