      "text": "Hi.<p>I&#x27;ve received a very exciting job opportunity via some contacts from a previous internship. I&#x27;m currently enrolled in a CS master (started half a year ago) in Europe and have been somewhat unhappy with it, it&#x27;s not as interesting or challenging as I was expecting and there doesn&#x27;t to be the same exciting atmosphere among students as there was in my bachelor (although lockdowns will surely be partly to blame). For these reasons, I&#x27;m very strongly considering going for it, thus effectively giving up on my master degree. Although the company itself is quite prestigious I&#x27;m naturally still afraid that I&#x27;ll be missing out on interesting opportunities by going for this one. Has anyone here made a similar choice? Can anyone comment on their experience without a master degree? For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m interested in robotics&#x2F;controls and will be working in that field. Thanks!",
