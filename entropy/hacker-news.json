      "text": "Hello HN.<p>I&#x27;m about to take on a C++ project and have never programmed in C++ before (usually use Java&#x2F;TypesScript&#x2F;Python). Could someone with more experience please a give brief overview of a modern and &quot;best practices&quot; approach for developing products based on C++? Things I&#x27;d find interesting to know:<p>1. What does modern C++ look like? Any good books on the topic?<p>2. Are Makefiles still being used? Or is it more common to use something like Bazel?<p>3. Package managers?<p>4. Linters? Formatters?<p>5. IDEs people use? VSCode?<p>6. DevOps workflow? Any best practices for integrating everything into a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline?<p>7. Testing frameworks &#x2F; approaches?<p>Thank you!",
