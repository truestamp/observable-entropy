      "text": "Dear HN<p>I&#x27;m a Computer Science student, specializing in Artifical Intelligence, who is currently nearing  the end of his second last year of university. This means I&#x27;ll have to do my Master&#x27;s Thesis next year. However, we must already choose a topic this year.<p>My university offers quite a lot of topics, but none of them got me excited. None of them gave me the idea: &quot;This seems fun, I really want to work a whole year on this&quot;, which is unfortunate. When you have to spend at least 700 estimated hours on something, it better gets you excited. It better be something you really want to work on.<p>There is a bright spot. We are allowed to propose a topic ourselves (which is not included in the list of topics). This may be in correspondence with a company. The idea to ask HN for a thesis proposal suddenly popped into my head, which leads to the following questions:<p>Do you have a thesis proposal for me? Or does your company have a thesis proposal for me?<p>If you can answer any of those questions with a &quot;yes&quot;, feel free to reach out to me at hn_sebos [@] protonmail.com. Additional questions are always welcome.",
