It needs to stay the same, no matter where you are visiting the application. The only exceptions are the comments. I was testing this using Web Browser plugin.<p>I did a lot of research, but did not find a best practice. How would you solve this?<p>Currently I have created the following snippet:<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;&#x2F; To-Do: Needs to account summertime\n  public dateToUTCDate(date: string | Date): Date {\n    const time = date instanceof Date ? date.getTime() : Date.parse(date.substring(0, 10));\n    return new Date(time + new Date(time).getTimezoneOffset() \\* 60000);\n  }</code></pre>\n```",

I’m comfortable, paid well, and work relatively stress free.<p>The issue is that over my career I have built many different tools to accomplish various “required” tasks.

The rest were shelved for reasons out of my control (but not for a lack of capability, completeness, etc..)<p>I’m 10 - 15 years out from retirement and I’m annoyed that I can’t point to anything tangible that has had any impact on anyone.<p>I am trying to figure out if I’m lying to myself, by thinking I’ll find the proverbial greener grass somewhere else.<p>With that, do you find your job fulfilling?",
