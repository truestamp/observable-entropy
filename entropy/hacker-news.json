      "text": "Hi HN,<p>Spent ~15 years in tech startups, worked very hard, got lucky this time. I&#x27;m worth about ~$25 million and will likely 10x this in the next funding round. I was raised by a single mom &#x2F; middle class and this amount of money is not something a single person I know has. I&#x27;m all over the tax planning &#x2F; wealth advisory, not concerned about that.<p>Where do very rich people hang out? Should I seek out the most exclusive social club and buy my way in? Start investing? Try and join corporate &#x2F; non-profit boards?<p>I have very young children and they will be put in elite private schools, so they will network and make friends in this sphere. But does the hustle never stop? My goals after exiting the 70 hour tech exec grind are to invest aggressively and start a non-profit focused on some unique ideas I have. Should I just keep stumbling from thing to thing and meet people on the way? It seems like a lot of very rich people I know also know a lot of other very rich people, and I&#x27;m unsure how that happens except through schools I never went to, frats I never joined, parents I never had, and networks I seem to be unaware of.<p>A bit tongue-in-cheek, but what is the guide for a new hundred-millionaire?",
