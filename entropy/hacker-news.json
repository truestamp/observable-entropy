      "text": "After burning myself out in the 2000s working 60-80 hour weeks and spending another 40 learning new skills, I took a different approach in the 2010s. Instead of going after a position I was qualified for, I took multiple positions below my pay-grade. It worked out great. I made more money, had less responsibility, and the companies I worked for were ecstatic to have someone with my skillset on their payroll. It was great and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone that is at the top of their field and good with time-management. There are caveats and it&#x27;s not for everyone, but there are enough pros that it warrants consideration.<p>A few years ago I got an offer I couldn&#x27;t refuse and gave it up for my current position that was effectively tailor-made for me. It&#x27;s reward work and I get to solve a lot of problems ranging from ideation and design to development to productization, and everything in-between. Once I took the position, I got more comfortable talking to people about the way I worked through the previous decade and found that there were a lot more people that did the same thing, but only got comfortable talking about it when they moved on.<p>I find myself in a position with my current company where I am essential and effective, but I have a considerable amount of time to either pursue my own thing again or help out a smaller company in the way I used to.<p>Which brings me to my question. It was a hustle when I started working that way and with the number of people I&#x27;ve spoken with who had done the same, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if there&#x27;s a service or community of people looking to do the same.<p>Really just looking to start an open discussion around the topic.",
