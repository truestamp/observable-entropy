      "text": "Hi! More than a decade ago, I was an enthusiastic software developer who was also passionate about security and hacking. Six years ago, I had the opportunity of moving to a security role that I loved, and began a career that has been lately focused on code reviews and pentesting. Sadly, it feels like I already had enough of reviewing others products and pointing at their mistakes.<p>As a matter of fact, I would love to shift my career back to Software Development and focus on building stuff again, but I feel a bit lost. When I left, AWS was the new thing and nowadays people will deploy their thing on a kubernetes cluster that have been deployed with terraform. Scrum was the fix for all team problems but now it feels like a concept from the past. Coding in Python was pragmatic and trendy but now it sounds unprofessional if you dont do it in Go or Rust.<p>Honestly, I feel like a dinosaur and I feel overwhelmed, but I&#x27;m sure coding is what I want to do in life.<p>What tip would you give to somebody like me?<p>Thx &lt;3",
