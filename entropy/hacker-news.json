      "text": "After 2020, companies had to go fully remote. One thing I was wondering: how embedded systems engineers managed to do this transition?<p>I did internship in this field and worked for a year with embedded software, before I moved into backend engineering. From what I recall, in some occasions, I was okay with just a development kit. But there were many other ones that I needed more than that (probes and testing infrastructure are the ones on the top of my mind).<p>How did tech companies, especially hardware ones, dealt with this? I really can&#x27;t see how a company like Apple or Sony managed to keep releasing new devices with a complete remote workforce.<p>Please, enlighten me : )",
