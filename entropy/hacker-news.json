      "text": "I often find that at the end of each day I&#x27;ve saved roughly 5-20 articles. I keep them in my Roam graph, but I rarely go back and read them.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that I have a lack of quality links. That&#x27;s more the problem than anything. Instead of hoarding these and never actually reading them, I was wondering if there are tools out there that can help me digest articles more quickly? I think that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t read them. I just don&#x27;t have the time.<p>There seems to be a lot of mobile apps that attempt to solve this problem, but I&#x27;ve found their summaries lacking quite a bit.<p>I&#x27;ve also tried apps like Speechify that turn articles into audio. It works fine, but it still suffers from robotic like interpretation, and it&#x27;s still the entire article, often taking longer to listen to than read.<p>Does anyone use a tool, technique, chrome extension, etc. to read more articles during the day?",
