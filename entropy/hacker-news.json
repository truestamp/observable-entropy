Time and time again, though, I’ll stumble across YouTube videos or some form of media explaining that vsc skill ceiling is far lower than vim&#x2F;eMacs.<p>I don’t have a problem with anything on vsc - in fact, I use it when I ssh into servers because I like the nice “at a glance” file UI, and I don’t have to cd &amp; ls to see where and what everything is.<p>Unlearning all the vsc keystrokes, shortcuts, and tools is going to be a serious time commitment, but I’m a young guy and have a long career ahead of me. If vim is really that much faster, I’d be willing to take the performance hit for long term growth.",
