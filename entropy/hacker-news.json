      "text": "All,<p>Starting a new job in a few weeks and have been given the choice between a Mac or a Windows laptop. Similar specs - Mac will be a Macbook Air, M1 chip, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Windows is a Thinkpad w&#x2F; i7, same RAM&#x2F;SSD.<p>Used a MacBook in college back in the day, but have used Windows machines since for work and play. I will not be developing, it&#x27;s a management role, so mainly Office apps, MS Teams, web browsing.<p>Word&#x2F;Excel&#x2F;etc for Mac used to be terrible, but I understand in recent years MS has done a better job on those. I work w&#x2F; multiple monitors and understand that MacOS doesn&#x27;t have the same windows snap &#x2F; tiling features natively, but that can be added. The native integration w&#x2F; my phone to be able to iMessage on the laptop is appealing for sure. Wondering if there are other pros and cons I&#x27;m not thinking about - appreciate your thoughts.",

      "text": "If I have a site (e.g. SmithsRibsRestaurant.com) and have also purchased other related domains like BestRibsInMemphis.com and MemphisRibsAndWings.com, etc.) does it make any sense to simply use those domain names to redirect to the main site (SmithsRibsRestaurant.com)? Or would it be better to create microsites for the other domains that address the main keywords in the domain names (like Best Ribs in Memphis, etc.) and then have a link back to the main site? Or neither?\nI&#x27;ve tried searching but either find no definitive answer or find conflicting info. Looking for advice from some (hopefully) real world experience.",
