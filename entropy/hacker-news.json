      "text": "I&#x27;m wondering what measures, given sufficient resources, could have a meaningful impact in quickly reducing global emissions. I&#x27;m especially interested in what would require the involvement of a large group of people (millions) and&#x2F;or the use of large quantities of money ($ billions).<p>Some examples:\n- Assist governments in accelerating the ecological transition in their countries, giving access to additional resources when needed\n- Institute funds to reward individuals who contribute to the environment, for example by installing renewable energy systems or consuming green energy<p>It would be great to learn more about the root causes of the slow reduction in emissions, the main challenges and why they haven&#x27;t been solved yet.",
