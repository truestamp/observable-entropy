      "text": "Hey everyone.<p>A little background: I’m a backend developer. I have around 7 years of experience working on various backend code bases in PHP, Python, Node, etc. I also have a masters in Software Engineering.<p>I got into web development because in my home country that’s your only choice as a software grad. You’re either a front-end&#x2F;backend dev or you’re unemployed.<p>I was completely fine with the job in the first few years because it was easy money. But lately I’ve been thinking about moving to different areas (game development, embedded, etc.) to explore a little especially since I moved to north america a while ago.<p>But honestly after all these years working on these start ups and “fast-paced enviroments”, i feel like i’m not in touch with the basics and fundamentals anymore to make this jump.<p>I’m not sure about the best way to go about this. Do I need to read books? Do I apply to specialized junior positions that interest me? Do I need to get the comp-sci notes out?<p>How would you do this? What’s your advice?<p>Also I’m 31 right now (not sure if it matters)",
