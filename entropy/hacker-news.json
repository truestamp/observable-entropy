      "text": "I&#x27;m seeing an increasing voice that pornography is harmful. Like many men, I admit that I am no stranger to it having watched it since I was in my early teens. Now that I am in my 30s I realize how much it made me view humans as objects and the human cost behind it. If it was produced by AI I might have less qualms about it but I realize so many broken people are in the industry.<p>What have you done to abstain from it, how do you fight the urge to fall back on it, and for those successfully in cessation, what effects have you noticed?<p>I&#x27;m about 1 month in and I feel boredom and can&#x27;t say if it has any impact at all, other than feeling frustrated.<p>In my memory quitting tobacco had similar withdrawl and I&#x27;m actually quite surprised of similar symptoms.<p>I am convinced however that this is the right path and I want to invite HN to share their thoughts on this matter.",

      "text": "Hi all,<p>I _love_ Neovim. However, I think many parts of it could be easier to configure or understand, especially when it comes to LSPs. There&#x27;s a ton of plugins that fill the gap, but some of them are sparse in documentation. There&#x27;s also distributions like LunarVim that attempt to add a Doom Emacs-like layer above.<p>My approach is a bit different, simply giving an opinionated, modular, and documented configuration that an interested user can easily modify to their needs. It makes use of the most helpful plugins I&#x27;ve encountered to create the best experience I could muster while retaining an air of simplicity.<p>I hope this is helpful to someone out there!",
