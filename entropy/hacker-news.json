      "text": "From the lean startup perspective we have the principle of MVP, a really compelling and attractive idea for early stages SAAS-based businesses. On the other hand, for more mature stages of businesses, we have to be aware of the danger of &quot;second-system effect&quot; and have reasonable plans in place.<p>Now I come to my main question[1]: as a technical founder, how one can better prepare to avoid unnecessary and preventible (self-created) big technical problems while successfully transitioning from a (successful?) MVP to a good-enough (second but non-MVP) system, without endangering the whole SAAS business itself?<p>Thanks everyone for your thoughtful comments. Happy holidays and (in a few days) happy new year, 2022.<p>---<p>[1] - We know a new business faces myriad of challenges  that it needs to overcome; however, here, I focus on a single problem only for the sake of focused group discussion.",
