Yesterday I got a strange security warning telling me that someone tried to log into it and the account was locked.<p>I managed to unlock it via 2FA, and looked at the log they made available. It reported a &quot;strange&quot; login from the USA (I&#x27;m from Europe) and the IP address which I looked up via WHOIS and it appears to be an internal IP of Microsoft itself.<p>The access type was IMAP. Is it possible that it was just MS servers moving stuff around? Do they really have to authenticate as users? Is this a common thing?<p>I was presented with options to select if that was me or not. I selected not, hopefully it doesn&#x27;t mess up anything.",
