      "text": "Hey there! I have a partially validated personal finance management web-app&#x2F;assistant which is not about budgeting, but about optimized use of free cash (different to Copilot, Monarch, Lunchmoney &amp; the rest of the gang). Sadly I cannot build it myself because my dev skills are stuck at basic Python and Excel.<p>Atm validation data of my customer facing Docsend pitch &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docsend.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;ewkqzza7izzsycf2&gt; is as follows: 61 unique views on roughly 100 e-mails with 3 lifetime deals sold (not my mom and dad!). 77% avg viewed with several &quot;would try it&quot; or &quot;would need to see more&quot; feedbacks as well.<p>I am now stuck. There is interest in an extremely tough B2C market for a more tailored approach, which I cannot build myself; no-code will never ever work, people also quickly get bored by fake numbers in click-dummies. In order to make it work I would need a great product designer and an engineer (or two), probably in a funded co-founder mode.<p>Currently I am thinking I have these options:\n1) park the idea for some time and wait for a better time, \n2) kill it, \n3) try to find investors (pre-seed, angel?),\n4) send it to Copilot &#x2F; Monarch and tell them to build it.<p>What would you do? \nDoes it even make sense to try with an investor pitch deck? Apply for YC?\nWhat am I missing? More validation? If so, how?\nIt feels like a mission impossible.<p>My validation signals are clearly skewed (I personally know all 3 customers, and majority of the unique views) and I am also aware that personal finance is extremely personal and behaviour driven topic (not to even mention cultural differences between continents).<p>Thanks a lot for your thoughts!<p><i>Background:\nPreviously posted search for a co-founder on HN (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25809962), worked on my idea for 4 months, read 70 papers on personal finance, did the whole Mom Test, Norman, Cagan, Thiel package, found a co-founder, made a landing page, collected roughly 100 emails, stopped working with co-founder and finally ended on docsend. I also wrote about this journey on my substack &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eightyfour.substack.com&gt;.</i>",
