Yet, in a landmark case, a Florida federal court just struck it down and masks are no longer required at airports and on planes. If you don&#x27;t think there is a obvious political bias and censoring happening on HN you aren&#x27;t paying attention. How can a story this important to our freedoms be silenced and censored?",
