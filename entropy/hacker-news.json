      "text": "Been a while since I last interviewed. I have a Google interview for SW Eng coming up but I&#x27;m kind of lost as to how to prepare. I see there&#x27;s paid subscription in leetcode but it just seems too expensive and to be honest it seems like an overkill. I hear people spent months preparing for it.<p>So. What is your experience with it? What would you suggest? I haven&#x27;t set up dates yet but I think I&#x27;d do it in a few weeks time and just review some basic algorithms in the meantime. I do  have a day job and a family so won&#x27;t have much time.<p>Thanks",
