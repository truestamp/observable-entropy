      "text": "In the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s wage earners were lured to deposit their wages in bank accounts because they were &#x27;free&#x27; and made payments more convenient. It also reduced the chances of theft from the payroll and in general seemed like a great idea.<p>Fastforward 60 years: it seems to me as though it has gotten to the point that operating without a bank account is neigh-on impossible, especially for businesses. Which has - predictably - led to one rate increase after another, especially with interest rates near zero banks need other sources of income or they won&#x27;t be able to make their &#x27;quarterly earnings targets&#x27;, which are apparently somehow set in stone and shall be satisfied come what may.<p>So, I&#x27;m wondering: is it still possible as a private individual to operate without a bank account? What about doing so as a business?<p>Is anybody here doing this?",
