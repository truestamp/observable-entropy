      "text": "I would be interested to see the behavior for other users.  This seems to be the case with any search under my account.  For example, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=programmer tells me there are 234 million results on page 1, but returns only 3 pages.  When I get to the 3rd page it reports that &quot;Page 3 of about 236 results&quot; and that is the end of my search.  This truncated search results behavior occurs with every search term I have tried and I have noticed that if I log out I can continue to see page after page of results.  What is even stranger and somewhat unsettling is that I get different results depending on who I am logged in as.  If I log in under a relative&#x27;s under-used account they see 274 million results and can view all pages as if they are not logged in.",
