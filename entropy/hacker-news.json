Luck was on my side, I got in to a decacorn company, 3 months in and got offered 2 years contract.<p>I did not sign the contract because my family emphasize on finishing what I have started which is my management degree.<p>I intend to take another Bootcamp course in September 2022 after I finished my degree, preferably Data Science Bootcamp that focus on Computer Vision.<p>Will the Bootcamp neutralize the Gap year in my CV?",
