      "text": "I&#x27;m ~40yo semi-successful full-stack engineer&#x2F;hacker who had been recently diagnosed with ADHD (after more than decade of self-seeking journey and introspection). During my diagnosis I learned that ADHD is persistent in 5-7% in general population with some specialist speculating it&#x27;s more common in IT due to hypnotizing effect of computers. I know I&#x27;m not alone with this :)<p>In hindsight ADHD helped me to get into current position. Being constantly bored, high energy, positive-minded solution and tool seeker is often good thing in times of crisis. When things go stale and there are no things to fix but only boring forms remains it&#x27;s usually mortal battle with burnout, procrastination, self-doubt. One which usually ends with me quitting due to burnout or - rarely - getting kicked off because the next more boring thing took longer than anticipated.<p>Right now I&#x27;m on hiatus since couple last couple of weeks, but lack of direction and purpose is awful and with every morning I feel fires of restlessness growing.<p>Today I read recruitment ad about neurodiversity program which - supposedly - caters people with different neurodivergencies. Those were US on-site positions though and I&#x27;m in EU.<p>So getting to the point:\nDo you know &#x2F; can recommend companies with neurodiversity programs?<p>For myself obviously I&#x27;m looking for remote or EU companies (with relocation) but even if you know something that&#x27;s not in the region please feel free to contribute - maybe someone else looking will make use of it.<p><i>Obvious throwaway. Some half-truths embedded.</i>",
