      "text": "I was creating a bucket on GCP and noticed what I thought was an odd restriction[0]:<p>&gt; Bucket names cannot begin with the &quot;goog&quot; prefix.<p>&gt; Bucket names cannot contain &quot;google&quot; or close misspellings, such as &quot;g00gle&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m mostly just curious about the motivation behind these restrictions. My guess is that it&#x27;s to avoid buckets that make it seem like they&#x27;re owned by google, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be equivalent restrictions on azure[1] or aws[2] (they do disallow the prefix &quot;xn--&quot; and the suffix &quot;-s3alias&quot;, but these seem functional.) Is there some other reasoning?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;storage&#x2F;docs&#x2F;naming-buckets<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;rest&#x2F;api&#x2F;storageservices&#x2F;naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AmazonS3&#x2F;latest&#x2F;userguide&#x2F;bucketnamingrules.html",
