      "text": "So Limelight Networks (now officially Edgio) has acquired Yahoo&#x27;s Edgecast and Layer0. All three seem have their own infrastructures. Layer0 uses Varnish, not too sure what Limelight uses and I&#x27;m almost entirely sure that Edgecast uses custom software for their infrastructure.<p>Edg.io is alive and well, but how in the world are they going to merge all three different infrastructures together? Even their ip-ranges? I feel like it would take at least a year to fully merge the worldwide networks and technologies to become somewhat consistent in speed and performance.<p>EGIO stock hasn&#x27;t risen and nobody seems to really be talking about this at all. Maybe it&#x27;s just the time period we&#x27;re in but this seems like a big deal. This pretty much makes Edgio the largest and fastest CDN in the world.<p>Thoughts? Insight? Comments?",
