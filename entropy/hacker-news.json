I should be happy with my career. But I&#x27;m not.<p>I cant seem to care even for a minute for my job. I literally can&#x27;t even understand why everyone even cares.

I also don&#x27;t care about new programming technologies&#x2F;frameworks&#x2F;languages as 99.9% of it is just iterations of existing stuff that someone created to promote themselves, boost their ego or just had some free time.<p>How,and why do you care about your job? What did you change in your work environment or your own thinking that made you like your work more?",

A few approaches came up in my research:\n- Buy a PineTab&#x2F;RasPad&#x2F;CutiePi.\n- Buy a Chromebook tablet and install Linux on it.\n- Buy an Android tablet and try to install another Linux distro on it. Ubuntu Touch&#x2F;postmarketOS are some options that came up on my research.\n- Buy a x86 (Intel Atom) device.<p>Is there any other approach that I am not aware of?
