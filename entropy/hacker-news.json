      "text": "I am working on setting up an LLC and it is a huge pain in the ass. This is my first rodeo. I picked up LLCs for dummies and I am working on getting organized. However, I kind of feel like I am always missing something or doing something wrong. It is that fear of the unknown unknowns (not knowing if&#x2F;what I&#x27;m doing wrong) that has driven me to want to ask on HN if there are any good sources or communities for discussing LLC formation. Ostensibly HN is an entrepreneurial place so I hope this is an okay place to ask. I do have an attorney but advice can add up. I am getting a registered agent but that also is hella expensive and I have yet to pull the trigger. Any advice on where I can discuss this stuff on topic would be most appreciated.",
