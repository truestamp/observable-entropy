      "text": "I have been having so many issues with banks (especially neo-bank &#x27;startups&#x27; that are just selling out and getting acquired by existing institutions). These are becoming a huge headache for me personally, especially in terms of data longevity, i.e. Simple, etc. and also with their parent group BBVA. (all records deleted from existence for my existing Simple account, not ported over to the new BBVA &#x27;account equivalents&#x27;).<p>In general, I just feel like my previous decisions to use services because they ostensibly would simplify my life have lead me down a road that is seemingly impossible to reverse. Trying to balance books is a nightmare because all the transaction entries on these ledgers have 16 character descriptions, and just suddenly interrupting services is also problematic because I realize that one key piece of information is on a service I rarely use.<p>I feel like, for example, BBVA&#x27;s execution of a transfer from my account with them to &lt;OTHER BANK&gt;, and then waiting to charge the ACH fee a week later, so that it breaks their requirements to close an account - that must be a violation of some law, right? Deliberately structuring the timing of transactions to get around a client request to close an account is absurd, and yet this is being done. Despite being a client of an institution that was eaten up by another institution, this feels predatory and extremely disruptive to daily life.<p>Banks are covered by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, but what about other abuses? Like a SaaS company continuing to charge you despite cancellations. Does FTC cover consumer protections that aren&#x27;t financial services specific?",
