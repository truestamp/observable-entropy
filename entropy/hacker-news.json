      "text": "Hi Folks,<p>Just been informed by the CEO that the board has taken the decision to try and sell the company I work for ASAP and they want to retain me up to the point of exit.<p>I have been offered a retention bonus to stay, or an Exit Bonus if the company is sold. I want to know how much I can depend on these eventually coming through to into my bank account, considering the following terms:<p>- The bonus is discretionary; any queries&#x2F;disputes as to bonus earned&#x2F;payable the CEO&#x27;s decision is final.<p>- Retention bonus is subject to overall company cash but is earned and paid as soon as cash permits if relevant (it&#x27;s unlikely the cash situation will permit the payments, particularly in the opinion of the CEO)<p>- Bonus is lost and not payable if notice has been given to terminate employment.<p>- The exit bonus is payed from the proceeds of the sale (and I suppose that could be in arrears if that&#x27;s how the buyer pays).<p>Is there any change in wording I should insist on?<p>As a separate question has anyone had any success negotiating a higher percentage of exit value as a bonus (as the head of a department when informed of the sale, not when being recruited), and if so how did you go about it?<p>Thanks very much for your help :)",

I&#x27;m looking to develop for the local market, but I want to try ideas that have already been tested in other countries (especially southeast Asia market) and adapt from there. Any example that would be considered essential nowadays? I&#x27;ve seen people write scripts to automate jobs and stuff but I lack domain knowledge to really know where to focus. Thats why I ask your collective experience. Thanks",
