      "text": "A common mistake I see more and more people do is to build websites using React and Vue.js.\nThese frameworks are meant to build web apps, they provide no advantage if you want to build a content website, worse they will kill all your SEO efforts.\nHaving done a lot of SEO research in the past year, I came to the conclusion that search engines heavily penalize React and Vue.js websites even when they use server side rendering and I think they do this rightfully.<p>If I am looking for some kind of information, I want to have it right away, with spending as little bandwidth as possible and certainly I don&#x27;t want to start a web app with over 1mb of javascript.<p>To summarize:<p>- Where React or Vue.js are a good choice:\nWeb Apps that you don&#x27;t want to be indexed by search engines. Such as SaaS tools or administration interfaces.<p>- Where you shouldn&#x27;t use React or Vue.js:\nContent websites with little dynamic functionalities that you want to be indexed on search engines.",

      "text": "Looking for some advice here -<p>I&#x27;m a non-technical jack-of-all-trades who can handle marketing, design, sales, etc. A few months ago, I approached a friend who&#x27;s quite strong as a developer to collaborate on a side project that has positive feedback from the early user research I&#x27;ve done. We agreed to split equity evenly.<p>However, they have not contributed over the last few months (no line of code started), despite me checking in and reporting my progress. When I ask, they say they are busy with work, which is understandable as we both have full-time jobs in tech. However, last week when I ask them if they were still interested continuing at all, they insisted that they were but simply couldn&#x27;t find the time.<p>What gives? I&#x27;d rather them tell me upfront if they weren&#x27;t interested in continuing, instead of dragging out for who knows how long. I&#x27;m also tired of checking in every few weeks with no updates.<p>Any advice for how I should handle this situation?",
