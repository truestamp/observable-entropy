But to stop this stuff thee Gov and the telecom providers have given a method to stop this nonsense. You just need to opt-in into DnD (Do not disturb) for free. You can easily do it directly from dialer or from the provider&#x27;s website&#x2F;application. Personally after I opted-in in the past few years I did not get even a single spam&#x2F;scam calls or messages.<p>But, when I made Signall (privacy messaging app) as my default messaging app, I started getting hundreds of spam messages. I think making Signal app as default messagaing apps cancels the DnD plan.",
