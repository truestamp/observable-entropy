Recently, I lost my mother to COVID in my home country and had to visit home to perform the funeral etc. Also, I have a young family here in the CA with a 3 year old child in autism spectrum.<p>I am feeling overwhelmed by the whole situation and need some guidance&#x2F;pointers on how to cope with this. My spouse is very supportive but we both need some kind of professional help to avoid burnout. Any advice&#x2F;help would be totally appreciated. Thanks hackers.",
