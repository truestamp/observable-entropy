I also know there is at least one person who causes more confusion than clarity (our cross functional partner manager have said this).\nI feel like I was under-leveled when I joined the company.<p>I know I can interview elsewhere and get paid more.<p>But I really love the work, roadmaps&#x2F;vision, this team, business unit, and really do believe in the company’s future.<p>What’s the best way for me to help my manager get me the best possible compensation increase in upcoming review? I have asked for feedback and whether I’m on-track to be promoted. They’ve said yes and I’m reasonably confident I’m at the next level.  What do I do to make sure I communicate my value as being at the upper end or median point of that level.",
