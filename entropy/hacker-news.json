      "text": "For almost a year I&#x27;ve been using this low-code platform to build, test, and launch our app. I can&#x27;t imagine the time it would have taken us if we had tried to make what we did in house. Not to mention the dev costs we would have had if we outsourced the build.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of other low-code platforms out there, so here is the pros&#x2F;cons of using draftbit.com<p>Pros:\n- Once learned, the interface is straightforward and can be navigated quickly\n- The community is growing daily and the majority of easy-to-medium difficulty questions are already answered within it. If you have a more niche, challenging question...\n- Then, you&#x27;ll find that the community as well as the Draftbit Admin are quick to reply and help\n- Great for if you are looking to create a product that is just past the MVP stage, all the way to a full-blown product\n- Ability to export the React Native code and work on it outside of DB<p>Cons:\n- They are a newer company so you&#x27;ll find some features they are still working on building out.\n- You have to be cognizant of bugs on their end at times. These are generally fixed quickly but it happens more often than I would like.\n- If you need a more complex feature, you will need to learn how to code in JS or React Native. This is the case for most&#x2F;all low-code platforms, but still wanted to put this out there",
