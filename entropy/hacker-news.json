      "text": "Bonjour! I’d like to share a rather small project which I believe may be of use for some of you.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jgehrcke&#x2F;github-repo-stats\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jgehrcke&#x2F;github-repo-stats</a> is a GitHub Action that I started building about 1.5 years ago, to overcome the 14-day limitation of the visitor&#x2F;clone plots shown in GitHub&#x27;s &quot;Insights&quot; tab.<p>The project has some seemingly happy users and I believe we managed to address some of the more embarrassing bugs. That is, I believe this project is ready for a new wave of feedback. Which is where you come in, hopefully  :-).<p>When I researched the solution space back then I found Actions that relied on an external system to push data to (like S3). I thought that it’s simpler to keep the time series data in the repository that the GitHub Action runs in. Also, I have opinions about data analysis and visualization and so I wanted to take full control of that. The goal from the start was to generate a self-contained report artifact on a daily basis (with good characteristics in terms of sharing and archiving), and to also persist that via git.<p>Quick technical description: this Action runs once per day. During each run, it<p><pre><code>  - fetches traffic stats (visitor count, etc – for the last 14 days) via GitHub’s HTTP API.\n  - persists new data points (in the GitHub git repository that this Action runs in!).\n  - generates a minimal HTML and PDF report, both of which are also persisted in the repo that this Action runs in.\n</code></pre>\nThe HTML&#x2F;PDF documents can be exposed right away via GitHub pages. The PDF report contains vector graphics so you can zoom in much more than necessary (and if your boss needs a print then this might look good enough). The plots in the report are meant to show a long time frame. For example, here you can see for the last 1.5 years how the daily visitor count (and other metrics) evolved for jgehrcke&#x2F;github-repo-stats:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgehrcke.github.io&#x2F;ghrs-test&#x2F;jgehrcke&#x2F;github-repo-stats&#x2F;latest-report&#x2F;report.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jgehrcke.github.io&#x2F;ghrs-test&#x2F;jgehrcke&#x2F;github-repo-st...</a><p>What I find really cool is that there are users who run this Action in a certain repository dedicated for reporting, for many target repositories. How to do that is described in the main README in the section &#x27;Tracking multiple repositories ...&#x27;.<p>Interesting things I learned about through this project:<p><pre><code>  - Vega&#x2F;Altair for plotting\n  - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bats-core&#x2F;bats-core for CLI testing\n  - GitHub Actions: how to build them, how to do release management. I also learned that testing a GitHub Action is hard, especially given the heterogeneous set of environments that it might run in.\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to try this out then besides the main README a good place to start is this tutorial: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jgehrcke&#x2F;github-repo-stats&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tutorial\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jgehrcke&#x2F;github-repo-stats&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tutorial</a><p>All of this was built rather pragmatically, and I want to keep it that way. There is a plethora of smaller and bigger things across all parts that are generally worth improving (docs, plots, architecture, cleanup), but before deciding what to touch next I&#x27;d love to hear your ideas. Thanks!",
