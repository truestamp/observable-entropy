      "text": "I haven&#x27;t really looked into authenticator apps before, but with the increases in SIM-jacking I think it&#x27;s time. I don&#x27;t use Google, so Google Authenticator is out. I use Duo at work; can you use that for arbitrary personal services? Are there others apps that come recommended?<p>Also, just general questions: are these apps usually free (if not, free isn&#x27;t a hard requirement)? Is there some standard, or does each service only support a subset of apps? What happens if you lose your phone?<p>Any info is appreciated<p>Edit: One more question: I see rumblings from some people about using password managers as an <i>alternative</i> to 2FA apps. Is that a valid strategy? Does one make the other redundant?",
