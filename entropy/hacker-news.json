      "text": " What are the 5 hottest dbt Repositories one should star on Github 2022?<p>dbt is a software framework that sits in the middle of the ELT process. It represents the transformative layer after loading data from an original source. Dbt combines SQL with software engineering principles.<p>Here are my top5!<p>-  Lightdash (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightdash&#x2F;lightdash): Lightdash converts dbt models and makes it possible to define and easily visualize additional metrics via a visual interface.<p>- ⏎ re_data (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;re-data&#x2F;re-data): Re-Data is an abstraction layer that helps users monitor dbt projects and their underlying data. For example, you get alerts when a test failed or a data anomaly occurs in a dbt project.<p>-  evidence (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;evidence-dev&#x2F;evidence): Evidence is another tool for lightweight BI reporting. With Evidence, you can build simple reports in &quot;medium style&quot; using SQL queries and Markdown.<p>-  Kuwala (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kuwala-io&#x2F;kuwala): With Kuwala, a BI analyst can intuitively build advanced data workflows using a drag-drop interface on top of the modern data stack without coding. Behind the Scenes, the dbt models are generated so that a more experienced engineer can customize the pipelines at any time.<p>- fal ai (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fal-ai&#x2F;fal): Fal helps to run Python scripts directly from the dbt project. For example, you can load dbt models directly into the Python context which helps to apply Data Science libraries like SKlearn and Prophet in the dbt models.",

However, I am not legally allowed to collect anything that could potentially identify the user.<p>I am looking for a solution that would automatically generate a random email alias on form submission, so that I would be replying to xyz123@aliasprovider.com and they&#x27;d receive it on their john.doe@ibm.com, without me ever seeing their real email address.<p>This should be a solution that works fully on client side (without need to install browser plugins or perform any action), maybe hits 3rd party API or mail server, and their address is impossible to retrieve on my side.<p>Thank you for any advice!",
