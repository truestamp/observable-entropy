      "text": "I live in a smaller European country where salaries are a lot lower than they are in the US. The upside is, I feel that the pace of work is also a bit easier; I get 5 weeks of paid vacation each year plus long(ish) parental leaves for each children born. Also, in reality, I don&#x27;t have work nearly as much as my contract says I should be working. All around I would consider my work pace pretty chill.<p>I&#x27;ve been eyeing some American companies offering fully remote jobs with very high salaries and would consider applying, but I&#x27;m a bit anxious about the supposedly hard work culture in the US companies. So my question is, how many hours per day do people working on remote jobs in these companies _actually_ work? Do you have to be on the call around the clock if a critical bug needs to be patched? How much vacation do you get per year?<p>I get that probably higher paying positions are more stressful, but I would be pretty happy with something like 100k$, which seems to be in the lower end of US tech salaries.",
