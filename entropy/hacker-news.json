      "text": "I recently bought some goods on PayPal for around 5000$. And I had configured the PayPal settings to charge my card in the currency of the seller invoice. But PayPal changed the currency of the transaction to CHF(my account currency). That enabled PayPal to take 184$ as currency conversion charges. My card currency is USD. My bank converted the CHF amount back to USD leading to additional charges of 200$. So in the end, I payed around 5400$ for a transaction that should have costed me 5000$.\n PayPal accepted that they have a bug in system and refunded me 184$(PayPal conversion charges) back. But the banks additional charges, they don&#x27;t take any responsibility. I think they should pay me any additional costs that arise due to the PayPal bug.\n And the customer service, always asks me to contact the bank. I have atleast spend the last week trying to send email, messages to PayPal customer support without any success.\n What do you guys think? Shouldn&#x27;t they pay me any costs including the bank charges?",
