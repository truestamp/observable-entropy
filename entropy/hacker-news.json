      "text": "95% of the time I work is spent SSHing into a faster server than my laptop, working with a variety of git repos on there.<p>5% of the time, there are internet jitters that make this not feasible and I rsync the directory and continue working locally. Sometimes after this I&#x27;ll end up working again in the repo on the server and so end up with two directories that started at a common point but have diverged.<p>Ideally I want to do a kind of &#x27;rsync merge&#x27;, a git merge but just with two directory trees that are close-but-not-quite aligned. I don&#x27;t want to temporarily create separate parent git repos since the directories themselves already are git repos and that sounds like a confusing recipe for disaster.<p>Is there any kind of standalone &#x27;git merge&#x27;-esque tooling for independent directory trees?",
