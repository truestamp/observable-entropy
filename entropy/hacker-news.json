      "text": "I was a Frontend Developer for 7 years and, under a new title, FE Product lead on most of our internal client-facing applications for 3 years and find myself interviewing for positions in FE while also attempting to relate both abilities and it&#x27;s not gone well recently.<p>(To my mind I can&#x27;t just hop in as PM at a new company as there&#x27;s an entire Dev culture for those prospective employers which I should understand from the ground up.)<p>This post is very poorly worded and omits so many of my thoughts on DevRel&#x2F;DevOps, but I&#x27;ve found myself recently describing to interviewers why I want to work  in Dev (ground-floor dev work to get a good understanding of the dev needs of those prospective companies) as well as trying to establish why I have the capacity to be a good fit for Product Management for them in 3- to 5-years time.<p>At this point should I even be looking into FE jobs or should I seek out  PM? What intermediary steps am I missing (certifications, job titles, etc)",
