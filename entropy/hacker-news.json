      "text": "I have been looking for a new job for around four months and have had little success. One job rejected me after the final interview. But most jobs have either not replied to my application or I&#x27;ve been rejected a week or so after submitting my resume.<p>My current role is a mix of business development and product management. It&#x27;s hard to describe on a resume or give measurable achievements. I&#x27;ve been looking at product management roles as well as general business development opportunities.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I am being passed over due to my resume (it&#x27;s three pages) or if I am not seen as qualified for certain roles or a mixture of both. Or if it&#x27;s something else altogether like roles not really being available.<p>Any tips? Is my long(ish) resume the problem?",
