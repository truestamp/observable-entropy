      "text": "Do entities like ESPN, NCAA, etc. crack down on illegal sports streams? And if so how is it technically possible?<p>As an American who has emigrated to a foreign country I get a lot of mileage out of googling &quot;free sport streams&quot; when I want to watch my favorite games.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that the more popular a game is, i.e. the super bowl or the final four, the more difficult it is to find a working stream for. This leads me to believe there is some effort on part of entities like ESPN and the NCAA to crack down on these &#x27;illegal&#x27; streams.<p>Thanks !",
