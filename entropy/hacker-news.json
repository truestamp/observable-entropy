And the moderation here is simply unmatched.<p>My only quibble is that when I click the link to favorite a submission&#x2F;thread, I end up on my favorites page, which means I then have to click back to return to the thread. Not sure why it works like this, but generally, I&#x27;d much rather just end up back on the original thread.<p>Is this something that can be changed, or is there some other reason it works like this?",
