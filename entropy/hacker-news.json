In the workplace in particular, the project I&#x27;m working on has an almost unreasonable amount of columns, and our userbase has said that they can&#x27;t live without any of the columns.<p>Are there any (web)apps out there that any of you use or have worked on that try to organize or segment tabular data into manageable chunks? Trying to find some kind of design inspiration that won&#x27;t involve the usual cry of &quot;let&#x27;s rewrite the app and burn what we have!&quot;",
