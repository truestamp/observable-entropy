      "text": "So I am a 24 YO experienced digital marketer based in Sydney, Australia. I am looking to join an early stage startup in a marketing role as I have always been interested in owning and scaling technology products. Best bet would be joining a startup I guess as I don&#x27;t have a strong network in the industry.<p>I have 4 years experience owning and scaling non-tech products in non-tech industry. Also, led marketing teams. Now I am having difficulties finding a job in a startup.<p>I&#x27;d love to get some suggestions and ideas on how I might be able to get in. Love to hear some of marketer&#x27;s experience here.<p>Also, I am thinking of simulating a marketing plan for my top selected startups. Would that be worth the time and energy?<p>Thanks in advance for all the answers<p>I have applied to a bunch of them but",
