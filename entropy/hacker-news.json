      "text": "I lived here for a couple of years and I thought the pandemic would hit pretty hard here eventually. But so far it hasn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m really surprised because it&#x27;s very densely populated, people don&#x27;t social distance (e.g queues will have less than 1m gap, and  rubbish day everyone basically moshes, and social distancing is not enforced) and life hasn&#x27;t changed much here. Everyone wears masks and uses the checkin apps and a whole lot of other measures like that. But there&#x27;s a large old population who live in some sort of retirement homes and there&#x27;s a lot of public transport. And vaccination rate is exceeded by places like Singapore and Hong Kong, but no large outbreaks, or death spikes, like in other places. And also we&#x27;re right across the water from mainland China so things are not really not different in terms of geography, urban planning culture (if anything is far less space here and everything&#x27;s more crowded than in an average mainland City), and so on... The one big difference is the lockdown measures have been far less severe here, if there can be said to have been a lockdown at all. And while we closed the borders at some point there&#x27;s been international flights and people coming and going as long as you have the proper paperwork basically throughout the entire duration. I&#x27;m so curious what the reasons might be and maybe it&#x27;s something that other places can replicate.",
