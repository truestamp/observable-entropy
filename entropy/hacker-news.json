      "text": "Some software has two &quot;levels&quot; execution. A primary level, which is developed by the vendor, and secondary level which may be provided by the users to perform relatively complicated custom logic -- logic  beyond that would be reasonable for simple configuration or a UI.<p>Is there a name for this?<p>Consider a software system that &quot;delegates&quot; execution points to some other language or runtime entirely. These are systems that have some level of &quot;scripting.&quot;<p>For example, say I have a web application written in .NET which has a workflow engine. This engine can be configured, and might even have a UI to drag boxes and arrows around.<p>However, at the end of a workflow step, I also allow the option for my users to provide some JavaScript that is executed server-side that produces the next workflow recipient. It can execute whatever logic it wants -- all the engine cares about is the result it returns.<p>So, the PRIMARY execution engine delegates control to a SECONDARY execution engine, then incorporates the result that comes back into further execution.<p>I intuitively know about this architecture model, and I&#x27;ve used models like it many times, but I&#x27;d like to know if there&#x27;s an accepted, general name for this model.<p>(Note: I am fully aware that I may have answered by own question in the title. If so, let me know.)",
