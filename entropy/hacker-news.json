It polls for news headlines every hour and the ones that are there again and again rise to the top:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wolfschedule.com&#x2F;news<p>So if you make it all the way down to the score of &quot;1&quot; those are very fresh, only seen in the last hour and there is no guarantee they will rise.<p>But some do rise and if they are at the very top they have been seen over and over for the past 24 hours. Max high score is 24.<p>Similar to legiblenews, there are no photos, just the text to scan. I like the freshness of this system. Every time I want to know &quot;ok so what are the BIG stories&quot; I scan the top score ones and sometimes I make it down to low score ones.",
