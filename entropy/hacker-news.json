      "text": "The Dapp concept has lots of theoretical promise, but looking at the Dapp List (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thedapplist.com), it all feels very incestuous. Lots of web3 apps that are about managing problems that web3 creates.<p>Where are the new innovations that web3 tech is supposed to unlock?<p>To me, the ecosystem feels like non-engineer-techy-types who are looking to get in early in case &quot;it&quot; actually takes off. None of the high-skill engineers I know have much interest in web3 at all. I would presume that web3 _needs_ these engineers to _get_ interested if there&#x27;s any hope for it in the long-term.<p>Hence this post -- am I in a filter bubble? Is there something here?",
