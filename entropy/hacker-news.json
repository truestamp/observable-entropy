      "text": "Hey all! I just got my first software development job and wanted to say thank you to the community!<p>I started lurking here about three years ago while doing some research on how to best get started with a career in software. A lot of the topics that get discussed here were&#x2F;are over my head. It was very valuable to see these conversations and try to &quot;translate&quot; them. I&#x27;ve learned a lot here about development as well as what the industry is actually like. I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m going into this with realistic expectations.<p>For anyone who is curious about how I got here, this is roughly how I did it:<p>2015 - Graduated with BA in History.<p>2018 - Started self teaching how to program, got an office job and automated everything I could.<p>2019 - Took four semesters of night classes to meet the math per-requisites for my local CS program.<p>2020 - Took a butt load of CS classes while working.<p>2021 - Finally convinced my company to let me help the software team (part-time).<p>July 2021 - Partner gets job out of state, apply for dev jobs in that city even though I hadn&#x27;t finished my degree.<p>August 2021 - After a long interview process, accepted an offer for my very first software development job!<p>I feel like Hacker News was a big part of guiding me down the right path and am very thankful it is exists.",
