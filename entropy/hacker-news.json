      "text": "The Googlebot has a crawl budget which limits how deep into a website it&#x27;ll traverse relative to a given entrypoint. This can lead to unexpected omissions, for example Github issues with a high number and few or no cross-references.<p>For example: apache airflow issue 9939.<p>This issue wasn&#x27;t indexed by the Googlebot and can&#x27;t be found using Google Search.<p>And yet, stumbling upon such bits of information can be important and there&#x27;s an expectation that Google can find everything on the public internet.<p>How can internet users demand that big tech companies invest in such long tail problems and not just mainstream content which might be easier to sell ads for?",
