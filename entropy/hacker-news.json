      "text": "I&#x27;m one of the many skeptics about the metaverse. I think that the reason this idea is suddenly so popular is because it is baked by a large company (Meta, former Facebook), and due to the pandemic: while having a metaverse to explore could be a great opportunity during a lockdown, who would prefer a meeting in the metaverse vs an in-person meeting when the real world is freely accessible? (Except if you&#x27;re meeting people form the other side of the world, but the use cases that are being pushed for the metaverse don&#x27;t seem to discriminate between somebody physically close to you or somebody very far away). But I know that other people have a different opinion. So if you&#x27;re a metaverse supporter, why do you like the idea? Why isn&#x27;t everybody on Second Life and what Second life got wrong that the metaverse will get right? Is VR a key part of the metaverse or can you also have one without VR? If VR is a key component, why isn&#x27;t that just a VR videogame? Which characteristics should something have to be considered a metaverse? It is possible to have a metaverse on Minecraft like this article claims [1]? Of course you don&#x27;t have to answer all these questions, you can just skip them an go straight to the point it your point has nothing to do with them.
