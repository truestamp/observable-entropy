      "text": "An example of how to do things wrong when starting a new service.<p>I ordered a pair of shoes that did not fit. So I go to the amazon page and start the return process. Do I want to return or exchange? Exchange. But wait, the new size cost ~$15 more than the others. Choose return. Go search for other shoes. Wait, the same shoes in the new size are now the same price as the other ones. Eh?<p>Lesson #1. Do NOT choose exchange.<p>I package the shoes up and put them in a UPS drop box. A week later the shoes have not been picked up. Call Amazon support (good luck with that). I explain the situation for 5 minutes and they tell me I need to talk to the Try-Before-You-Buy team. TBYB team says not to worry.<p>Four days later I call Amazon support (good luck with that). I explain the situation for 5 minutes and they tell me I need to talk to the Try-Before-You-Buy team. TBYB team says I need to talk to UPS and file a claim.<p>I call UPS support (good luck with that) and they tell me I cannot file a claim since I am not the shipper, it is Amazon. ha ha ha.<p>I call Amazon (good luck with that) they say they will cancel the charge even though it is the fault of UPS and cancel the charge on the second pair of shoes that I have not yet returned.<p>Lesson #2. Support with Try-Before-You-Buy is dysfunctional. Good luck with that.",
