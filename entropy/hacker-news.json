There are numerous articles that explain the benefits of &lt;button&gt; in detail.<p>And then we have top websites like twitter.com that use &lt;div role=button&gt; for everything. There are about 50 such elements on the start page alone.<p>This juxtaposition creates confusion and doubt. I would really like to know, if &lt;button&gt; is the clear, obvious choice that even junior developers should know to use it, then why do so many top sites choose &lt;div role=button&gt; instead?",
