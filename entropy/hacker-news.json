How to make the most from retrospective? In a previous team I found the stand-ups very boring as it was mostly for the manager and not for us, as people on the team worked on different things.<p>Also, what&#x27;s a typical path going from a team manager (EM1) to senior manager (EM2)? What are the things I should focus on to show I&#x27;m ready for managing managers? (I understand it can take a few years)",
