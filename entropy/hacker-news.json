      "text": "In my opinion, there are five primary industries that follow common missions with defined outcomes. If these industries succeed in implementation, it will have a predictable effect on civilization.<p>1. Autonomous taxis will change urbanization by allowing for reduced transit times and a more productive commute; shifting living from dense urban centers to more concentrated environments, expanding the suburbs.<p>2. Robotics technology will replace a good portion of the US labor force, as investments into robotics advances to more sophisticated AI models similar to Tesla&#x27;s Dojo.<p>3. Agriculture productivity will increase significantly per acre and grow more sophisticated, thus lowering the need for many foreign and domestic farming, and eventually reducing their costs. New species will be introduced as traditional agriculture is increasingly unsustainable in a changing climate.<p>4. Humans will adapt to become reliant upon technology integrated into their lives, particularly in VR + AR which they will spend equal or more of their time in these environments for productivity or play.<p>5. Human genetic engineering will be a serious subject, but may be far longer away, particularly as every generation has gotten increasingly liberal in their beliefs, likely first to mitigate disease and the second for cosmetic reasons.<p>These are assumptions premised on factors that may accelerate or decelerate their outcomes that are both predictable (e.g. business cycles) or more random (e.g. epidemics).",
