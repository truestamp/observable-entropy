      "text": "Human-Computer interaction is necessarily subjective simulation, cognitive oversimplification, and perceptually premature optimization. Do more, with less. Delegate control responsibly to autonomous systems; They have capability but lack reason. Humans are error-correcting. Future utopia entails watching robots work, and pressing button when they make mistakes and act funny. Also human-human relations coordinations to ultimately solve problems which haven&#x27;t had solutions engineered for yet, most often for unknown unknowns, less frequently manufacturing fault, and certainly never again operator error. Systems directing themselves, able to start entirely new industrial processes. Human supervision mandatory. Society doesn&#x27;t autopilot, individuals do.
