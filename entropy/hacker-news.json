I&#x27;m stuck using Google Calendar for work, but having a hell of a time finding a simple setup that lets me use the basic features in a way that syncs offline with my personal calendars. So many solution require constant management whenever things change.<p>I feel like Google is making this hard, but then I&#x27;m also not sure what calendar protocols limitations are exactly. CalDav seemed fine to me, but what do I know.<p>Bonus points for Linux application recommendations.",

This extension does that for me, and filters posts which I have already seen. Happy to get any feedback&#x2F;PRs! :)",
