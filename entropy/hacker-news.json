      "text": "It&#x27;s darned difficult to make a new and fresh word puzzle app, in today&#x27;s heated word game universe, but my kiddo and I tried, and this is our take.<p>1. The Stage - A box. Words popping out with missing letters. Ominous looking tendrils peeking out from the top<p>2. The Goal - Keep your words from going off the top.<p>3. Your Moves - A moving buffet of random letters to choose from, and the riskier strategy of moving letters between words (ProTip: That way lies Mt Doom), and Hammer Time to help you squash those stuck words.<p>That&#x27;s it! No ads, no tracking, no coins, no weekly subscriptions to get more vowels; Just words - coming at you like a horde of wilderbeast.<p>Developed by me, and PMd by my kid, who drove me mad, in a loving way (you haven&#x27;t lived until your 1st grader cries on seeing your memory graph going the wrong way), but we got to the finish line, and here it is...<p>Would love your feedback",
