      "text": "Moved out due to pandemic and I&#x27;m realizing that I&#x27;m probably not going to move back, at least not for the next few years, due to high rent in NYC right now, some safety and quality of life concerns, and my new job being permanently remote. All my jobs for entire adult life were tech jobs in NYC. I have no partner or family so I&#x27;m not moving &quot;towards&quot; anything or &quot;with&quot; anyone, I&#x27;m just gonna be alone by myself typing on the computer in a new area where I don&#x27;t know anybody, but now I&#x27;ll have to find some other way to cheer myself up besides telling myself that I&#x27;m headed home to my techy, artsy friends any month now. The bright spot is that I love the new job. Anybody else WFH in tech deal with a transition like this? How did you deal with sadness&#x2F;isolation and find happy, inspiring stuff in your new location? Did you just have to develop new non-city interests and change your whole deal? I am totally open to loving my current life even more than I loved NYC and I&#x27;m actually super extroverted and socially confident but I still feel so sad and lost and really afraid of what isolation will do to me over an additional 1-2 years if I don&#x27;t figure out how to stop feeling so lonely outside of working hours. Thanks for your thoughts.",
