      "text": "I want to start off with saying I generally enjoy this site. It’s a great place to find links to news, blogs, and other interesting technology-centric websites.<p>To that end, and I believe there are quite a few that may agree with me, it would be nice to be able to hide or remove certain types of entries from the list, such as <i>cough</i> cryptocurrency, NFTs, any-fly-by-night project, what have you.<p>It would be cool if this site could offer a feature like Reddit where you can actively subscribe to the types of things that interest you, and ignore everything else.<p>If other folks want to discuss the topics, so be it. But let me opt out going forward, please. I used to really get involved in the discussions around cryptocurrency, but frankly it hasn’t been good for my sanity and I’d rather just go about my life not hearing about it anymore.<p>It’s exhausting to hear how someone thinks they are gonna make it, or how fiat is filthy and I’m an idiot for not just following the bandwagon. At this point, I have no more energy to expend on the topic and want to go back to a pre-2012 Internet, before the snake oil ruined everything.",
