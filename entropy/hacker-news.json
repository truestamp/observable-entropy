      "text": "Hello HN. A while ago I came across a post here that showcased a really neat FOSS project which I am very certain was made and open sourced by the uk government.<p>It a was a web based app that included a very extensive collection of data tools such as data converters (i.e. json-&gt;csv), currency converters, hashing data and back and all sorts of other types of tools like that... it was very similar to 123apps.com but also leagues ahead of it.<p>I can&#x27;t for the life of me remember what it was called and searching for it hasn&#x27;t yielded anything useful. All I associate with it is the gov.uk website and their github page... But the problem is I couldn&#x27;t find it on there either, so it could very well be a false association but I am not entirely sure.<p>I know this is an extremely long shot given how little I remember about the project, so I really appreciate anyone who tries to help me find it.<p>Thank you.",

      "text": "I&#x27;m in the situation where (I believe) I have system which solves important problems in a tech sector where it is unfeasible, or at least far less practical and resource efficient, that I attempt to build this business from scratch rather than working with established players.<p>The two classic issues:<p>How does one go about effectively &#x27;pitching&#x27;? What are tips for getting in contact with the right people and enticing them?<p>And how does one go about the above without giving away enough information about the proposal to simply jot down, hire the relevant experts, and execute as if the idea is their own? Are patents the only way?<p>Not interested in the diminutive &quot;everyone has a good idea...&quot; response. You can go ahead and assume I&#x27;ve got a plan worth selling; if I was looking for feedback on the idea I&#x27;d share it, but as you can gather from my questions I won&#x27;t be. Thank you.",
