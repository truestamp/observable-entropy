      "text": "Hi HN,<p>A friend of mine is a semi-successful researcher with a semi-common German name. Over the past few months, citations of his work have dwindled and this seems to coincide with a large reduction in visitors to his website from Google Search.<p>Initially he assumed that this was due to a misconfiguration and asked me to check things over, ensure his server hasn&#x27;t been compromised, and so on. This was a dead end - everything seems to be in order and the Google Search Console reports no issues.<p>However, I have noticed that when I search his for name or phrases from his site, Google informs me that &quot;some results may have been removed due to data protection law in Europe&quot;. Links to his website do still show up sometimes, but only if very specific search terms are used.<p>My theory is that one of the people who share his name (which includes another researcher and an author) has filed a fraudulent Right to Be Forgotten request in order to bump themselves up the search results, but neither of us have any way of proving this or even finding out what that notification actually refers to.<p>He is understandably upset by this, and I&#x27;d like to help him so I&#x27;m asking HN: Short of changing his name, is there anything he can do?",
