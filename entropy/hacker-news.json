      "text": "At my workplace, I was working on a Django monolith, where managing the nitty-gritty of sending, monitoring, and managing event-triggered POST requests quickly became cumbersome. The requests were failing due to client-side issues and we were plagued by different observability problems as well. So, I was looking for a generic OSS solution for managing and monitoring webhooks and ended up making one.<p>This leverages Redis, RQ, RQMonitor, Fastapi, Uvicorn &amp; Rich. It just takes a payload, sends that asynchronously to the destination URL, handles exceptions gracefully, and exposes a GUI that lets you monitor the system and retry the failed jobs manually. The entire orchestra can be launched and horizontally scaled up by a single docker-compose command.<p>This standalone service is built for simplicity and it helped me to decouple the webhook management logic from the primary monolith I was working on. You might find it useful. Suggestions and pull requests are always welcome.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rednafi&#x2F;hook-slinger",
