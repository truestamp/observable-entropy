      "text": "Hi,<p>This is Dan and Genevieve from Burstable AI. We&#x27;ve iterated and made a 45 degree pivot, taking what we learned from developing burst (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28191459\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28191459</a>) to introduce a cloud service that provides access to a GPU-enabled machine using Jupyterlab to provide notebooks, shell access, and a code&#x2F;text editor. GPU access is measured and the first 50 hours are free.<p>This is *not* a platform to do crypto mining or run weeks of model training for free. We are focused on the R &amp; D phase of modern AI&#x2F;ML, where developers&#x2F;scientists are iterating, testing, and measuring results. We are running a beta program with a few seats left to get feedback and constructive directions for how to make Cloudburst a killer environment for modern exploratory AI&#x2F;ML research, whether you are a high-school student hacking on the weekend, a small team at a startup, or a consultant building ML pipelines for SmB&#x27;s (or some other user story we haven&#x27;t thought of yet).<p>Presently, signup is through your github account. If you have questions, please email us at beta@cloudburst.host.<p>Thanks to all our beta folks!",
