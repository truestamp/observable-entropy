The first book I&#x27;ve picked up to sharpen my skills is &#x27;The Pragmatic Programmer&#x27; by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas, as it seems to be the most recommended book in HN threads.<p>One of the recommendations in the book is to learn a new language every year, and read a technical book every month. I&#x27;d love to know what technical books you&#x27;ve read and why they are great.",
