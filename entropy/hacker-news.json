      "text": "ASK HN: Does the update to WhatsApp web maintain end to end encryption? If so, How?<p>There appears to be an update to WhatsApp Web. The current version works by scanning a QR code in your whatsapp client, which will then establish a connection with the browser. Upon receiving a message, the app will then send that message to the web site. This requires your phone to be active to use WhatsApp web.<p>The new update says:\n&gt; &quot;Your phone won’t need to stay online to use WhatsApp on linked devices, but if you don’t use your phone for over 14 days, your linked devices will become disconnected.&quot;[0].<p>It also says:\n&gt; Your personal messages, media, and calls are end-to-end encrypted.<p>How does the new update to whatsapp web maintain end to end encryption. I can&#x27;t find any details about it online.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;faq.whatsapp.com&#x2F;general&#x2F;download-and-installation&#x2F;about-linked-devices?lang=en",
