      "text": "My 2yo son was struck and killed by a garbage truck next to a children&#x27;s playground in the SF bay area less than 2 years ago. The driver who has fled violated multiple traffic rules which directly caused my son&#x27;s horrible death. We have evidence that the company&#x27;s unimaginable level of negligence allowed this to happen and now they want us to sign an agreement forbidding us to disclose the details.<p>I&#x27;m writing this in great pain as I was not able to talk about it for a long time. My entire family were devastated. My mom passed away unable to accept the loss. My wife suffers PTSD. I stopped working so that I can go to the cemetery to stay with my son everyday. It&#x27;s been almost two years.<p>They see our weakness not strong enough to go through litigation as it tortures us. They offered to settle through mediation with a laughable amount of money which I can earn in less than 4 years. And they want me to shut up so that they may do whatever they want to continue killing children in our neighborhood.<p>My family want to settle and avoid the additional suffering. I feel so weak. I want to protect them as much as possible but know in my heart I need to fight. I would never forgive me if one day another child gets killed and I could have avoided the tragedy if I choose to fight.<p>I need help.<p>What would you do if you were me?",
