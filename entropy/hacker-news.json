I don&#x27;t mind starting a business or working in an already existing one, but how do I get started&#x2F;get in&#x2F;distinguish myself?<p>Are startups okay with inexperienced (no internships&#x2F;full time experience)? I am about to finish my bachelors and looking for a place to work or make my own place to work.<p>I don&#x27;t have a startup business idea, but I&#x27;d like to get more involved in the community to see where I may be able to contribute.<p>Any tips&#x2F;advice and recommendations are welcome!
