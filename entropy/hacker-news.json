      "text": "Hey all!<p>One topic I&#x27;ve seen quite neglected in the general Silicon Valley&#x2F;Startup scene is the African market. Google tells me some companies, but I&#x27;d love to hear from founders&#x2F;PMs&#x2F;developers who have entered that market and what your biggest takeaways are!<p>full disclosure: I&#x27;m a startup founder who decided to take crack at the African market and somehow (by chance) found a niche and got 400k users in a year. However this was, as said luck, and I&#x27;ve got no idea about how to move on next. Hence this post.",
