I&#x27;ve been trying to leverage my local library system more but the majority of the technical, CompSci-esque books are laughable.  I found one book that&#x27;s good and I&#x27;m working through it, but most of the stuff there is &quot;Windows 8.1 for Dummies&quot; and &quot;Hosting your own blog&quot; sort of content.

Especially if I want to continue to progress my career &amp; not do sub-par work.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just overthinking it, but would love your thoughts on how best to handle this.",
