      "text": "I had my first computer 34 years ago. I have used keyboards since then and I developed my own way of semi-blind quasi-8 finger typing. However, this requires me to take a look at the keyboard frequently, because I keep moving my hands all over the place on the keyboard, and it is also far from being error-free. I&#x27;ve entertained the thought of learning touch typing for a while. I am about to take a break from work, so I may be able to tolerate some temporary typing speed decrease while learning&#x2F;practicing. What methods&#x2F;software&#x2F;etc. do you recommend me to learn?",

Many of the products I looked at were marketed as for use in aquariums or with reptiles.<p>So now Facebook is showing me ads for fish and reptile pet products. When I checked the &quot;why am I seeing this ad?&quot; page they&#x27;ve added pets, fish and reptiles to my &quot;interests&quot;.<p>The only place I&#x27;ve looked at those types of things is in the Amazon app.<p>What&#x27;s going on here?<p>P.S. I even have the global Android targeted ads setting turned off.",
