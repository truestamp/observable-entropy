I understand that funding is not the be all&#x2F;end all of the company, however, currently all we have are state sponsored grants and they&#x27;re running out quick. Moreover, most bulge brackets and startups have kind of a monopoly on tech teams at this point and inticing someone without cash here  is next to impossible.<p>We were considering applying for specific incubators within pension-tech and insuretech in order to build the team and resources, however, Singapore is quite limited in that space. We could also consider partnering with larger firms at the cost of giving up a lot of the company (which we are ok with) as the first and last thing we want is to give these platform workers peace of mind.Tldr - we&#x27;re in a bit of a predicament.<p>What are your thoughts - any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
