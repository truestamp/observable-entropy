Source code on Github &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;garywill&#x2F;BigSearch&gt; .<p>Besides basic features, it is with some special technical features also.<p>For example, it works with those websites that don&#x27;t provide GET&#x2F;POST interface to public (so-called Ajax-only websites).  Visitor need to open their page and input, then they show search results on page via Ajax.\nBig Search can turn such Ajax-only websites into search engines and add them to browser.<p>Chrome Extension API doc ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;reference&#x2F; ) is one of such Ajax-only websites. That&#x27;s a simple one. There&#x27;re more such websites with more complicated js involved to do search, which still need us to figure out.<p>Big Search repo on Github : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;garywill&#x2F;BigSearch",

A bunch of Docker containers, some microservices, nginx, a small PostgreSQL instance, etc. \nIt should be short-depth (&lt; 15“) for a wall cabinet and of course run Linux well. Affordable would be great, but not looking for cheap. Any recommendations?",
