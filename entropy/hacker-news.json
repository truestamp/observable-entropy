It has become much bigger than one person.<p>- Any tips&#x2F; thoughts on moving forwards? \n - Positive\n - Cautionary\n- Concept validation?\n- Connect with academia?\n - Or relevant specialists?\n- Independent release? \n - Incremental?\n - What would you want to know first?\n- I&#x27;d prefer to remain anonymous initially as if it is shown to be formative it will upset some people\n - Any advice here?<p>Would I be better asking somewhere else? If so where?<p>Many Thanks",
