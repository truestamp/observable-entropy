      "text": "Hi HN!<p>We&#x27;re Evan and Yinshi from Akia (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akia.com). We&#x27;ve built a customer engagement platform that specializes in the building and distribution of Mini Apps-- apps (if you will) that don&#x27;t require download or login.<p>You can send one yourself (this is a relatively naive example):\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;sys.akia.com&#x2F;demo&#x2F;textme<p>We&#x27;re looking to solve a problem local service businesses face around the fact that consumers are not very likely to discover and download a native app.<p>We initially built Akia to solve workflows using text-messaging and NLP, but quickly discovered that the last mile on NLP is very hard and consumers are happier using a mobile-optimized interface. We did a small pivot and have found a lot of success mitigating the challenges that businesses were initially looking at solving with native solutions.<p>By developing app-like experiences in the browser to be sent over text, Akia is building and distribution in one package.<p>We&#x27;re running up against our $1M milestone and are now expanding into other verticals. Would love thoughts and feedback, especially on use-cases that you think we&#x27;ve missed, or might be particularly interesting for this tech.",
