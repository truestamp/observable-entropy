      "text": "Hi. I&#x27;m a backend dev who writes mainly Java and PHP. Recently I&#x27;ve started getting job offers for the Go language. I ignored those first, but then I checked the Go docs and it seems pretty interesting so I&#x27;m considering a switch.<p>As with any language, I&#x27;m thinking that the language itself isn&#x27;t that big of an asset, so there must be some sort of tech stack that works well with Go, to make it a good choice for companies.<p>So, what is Go used for? And what&#x27;s the tech stack that&#x27;s expected of me as a Go developer?",
