      "text": "Recently I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe part of the reason I have such difficulty getting my needs met is because my definition of &quot;self-care&quot; has been too strict.<p>When I think of self-care I usually only think of &quot;healthier&quot; things like talking a walk, meditation, reading a book, etc. But I&#x27;m certain we all partake in all sorts of other activities that, even if they don&#x27;t necessarily sound all that honorable, still help us maintain stability and get through the day in general. For example, doom-scrolling as a way to wind-down after work, beers with friends on Friday night, watching funny youtube videos, etc.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m really curious to find out what you folks do regularly, deliberately or not, that would fall under this bigger umbrella of self-care activities. Listing the various things you do and explaining what you think it&#x27;s effect is would be super helpful for me, because I&#x27;m really struggling in this aspect...<p>Thanks so much!",
