      "text": "I want to setup a search engine that only shows me results from sites I want to see to use occasionally. I found programmablesearchengine.google.com which seemed good, added a bunch of sites (couple of subreddits, blogs of thoughtful people, HN etc.) but I am disappointed with the results.<p>For one, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have advanced features like &#x27;search only for results between those dates&#x27;, for another the results it gives aren&#x27;t good. E.g. when I google &#x27;favorite sites&#x27; it returns 1 result (which is from HN) but when I google &#x27;reddit slatestarcodex favourite sites&#x27; (with either normal or the programmable google) it correctly returns a bunch from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;slatestarcodex&#x2F; even if the &#x27;reddit slatestarcodex&#x27; part seems redundant as it&#x27;s already in my list. This obviously makes it much less useful because I don&#x27;t get good results unless I specify the site.<p>Is there a better alternative? Another search engine that offers you to setup larger lists of sites (rather than just doing site:..), something else built on top of Google, crawling the sites myself?",
