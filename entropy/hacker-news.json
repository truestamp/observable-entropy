      "text": "I have in mind not things that take years to master and that you develop over a lifetime, like programming or playing the piano. But there are some practical skills that can be learned in a couple of hours and refreshed with an hour of practice every month or so, but that have a disproportionate return on investment.<p>Two examples of skills that I regularly find useful are classical lockpicking and knowing how to tie a variety of knots. The first has gotten me and friends out of jams when someone lost a key and got locked out, etc.; and if you don’t know knots you will never be able to tie a load tightly to the roof of your car.<p>What skills do you recommend that I add to my repertoire?",
