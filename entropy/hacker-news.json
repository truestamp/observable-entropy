However I feel that I’m sometimes limited by my technical writing skills to communicate my ideas and concepts. Any advice on how to take ones technical writing skills to the next level?<p>I’m willing to do what it takes, being online courses, contributing to OSS process work or what else you might suggest.<p>Looking forward to tap into the HN hive mind on this topic!<p>Thanks,\nMax",

For example, I would like to confidently help smaller NGOs and political think tanks to fend off Russian&#x2F;Chinese&#x2F;etc cyber attacks and threats. \nWhat would be the most optimal way to self-educate in this are? I have some free time to invest, but not as much as when I was a teenager&#x2F;student and could play around programming and experimenting with technologies. This time it has to be more structured.<p>I would appreciate any ideas, but especially from someone who went through something similar.<p>Thank you",
