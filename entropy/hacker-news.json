I worked for 5 years in an international VC fund Altair VC; early investors in Miro, Deel, Pandadoc and many more great startups.<p>Recently I found out that my experience is very helpful to startups to help them excel their pitch, better show their strenghts and better negotiate.<p>So I decided to build a marketplace for such professionals (usually with 3-5+ years of experience) to help companies fundraise easier and faster.<p>We welcome both startups (you can start with a free call, get some advice) and VC professionals.",
