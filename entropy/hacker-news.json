I specialize in indexing the web and providing it to downstream processes in  warc format. My current role involves upleveling junior engineers as the system is pretty mature at this point and I probably won&#x27;t be promoted staying here. I could see myself building crawlers for a while but I&#x27;m not seeing any startups that need this skill. Where would you recommend I look for the next interesting project involving low latency jvm languages (like yc&#x27;s backed questdb)",
