      "text": "SpaceX is, lately, lofting satellites with laser links to other satellites, I assume pointing them at others leading and following in the same orbit, so they don&#x27;t need to track.<p>An orbit near 70° inclination takes satellites over New York and London. This enables Starlink to deliver traffic between those spots several milliseconds ahead of literally anybody else. Similar should be possible between NY or Europe and Asian markets.<p>Banks have spent many tens of $millions on microwave towers to get financial data between NYC and CHI just a few ms ahead of competition stuck on fiber 30% slower.<p>I wonder, is SpaceX offering these low-latency connections to banks for the big bucks? And, charging even more not to offer the same to competitors, too? Would the FCC allow the latter?",
