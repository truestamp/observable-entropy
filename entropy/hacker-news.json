      "text": "The other day I had a very brief discussion with another individual who believed that all private production should be socialized. That, e.g., farmers should give away their food for free and in turn have their needs be met for free. Ad infinitum. I&#x27;ve heard others with the same or a very similar economic ideology that they insisted would be the best thing for humanity.<p>Personally I&#x27;m quite the fan of capitalism and think that, while not perfect, it&#x27;s most definitely the best economic system that we have and that I, at least, can conceive of. That said, I&#x27;ve never been able to rationalize for myself, nor have heard others rationalize, what a society with socialized production would actually look like and how we&#x27;d maintain the same quality of life as we have today. Hence, this post. I&#x27;m really hoping that someone on the &quot;other side&quot; (though that sounds a bit too adversarial for my taste) can eloquently explain their thought process. Not trying to spark hostility, just want a thoughtful discussion.<p>Some of the big questions I have are:<p>1. Who does the hard&#x2F;dirty jobs in this society? Farming being one. But also construction, sewage, trash, ad inifitum. There are a lot of undesirable jobs and while maybe some people would be willing, I doubt our needs could be met when the same individuals could just work an easier job for the same reward.<p>2. How are &quot;needs&quot; defined? Food, shelter, clothing. Then what? Electricity? Internet? Smartphones? Gaming consoles&#x2F;PC&#x27;s? Games to play on those? Music? Memory foam mattresses? Etc. If all of these aren&#x27;t needs, then how would individuals with varying interests actually choose what they want to own?<p>3. What are the incentives to advance amd become highly skilled? Take doctors. Some are really passionate about what they do. Most may be a little passionate, but are mainly just intelligent people drawn by the money and prestige. Assuming medical school and university still exists, for what purpose would someone go through that pipeline when they could do something far easier?<p>The only answers I&#x27;ve received to these thus far are something along the lines of &quot;Well humans would just have to fundamentally change their nature and  learn to live like <i>x</i>.&quot; Which isn&#x27;t an answer at all.",
