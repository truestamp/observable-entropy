      "text": "Hi All,\nI recently launched the beta version of Let’s Gym and looking for people interested in using this app in hopes to get feedback.\nThe app idea came up after I moved to a new city and all my buddies back home were the people I worked out with daily. My drive to the gym suffered since the workout “comradely” was no longer there. After speaking to most people around the city it seem it was a common theme of people moving here and not having a workout partner. There are facebook groups in some cities that try and alleviate this issue but the problem was that you couldn’t filter on the workout goal of the person and responses back was more of a miss than a hit using FB.\nWe are in a very early beta in select cities in the US and would love feedback.",
