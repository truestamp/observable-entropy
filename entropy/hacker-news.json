Username, hostname etc. have been just modified for privacy purposes.<p>Also note note, this happened on the first run on that Linux computer so 2FA should&#x27;ve been enforced. But at in any point does the NordVPN client call for 2FA token. :(<p>Now, a honest question:<p>Who does not see this as a potential security hole here?\nIt&#x27;s the NordVPN server who should ensure that not <i>ANY</i> client can log in without correct 2FA token if it&#x27;s enabled. \nNow a Linux client can any time login if correct credentials are known.<p>It seems that the the 2FA is implemented on the client side completely. Which is not the correct way to do it. Fake spoofing NordVPN clients start to arrive which can bypass 2FA on any account.<p>Windows and Mobile NordVPN clients seem to enforce it, but if the 2FA verification is done on client side then the whole meaning is nullified.<p>Btw, this happened when I posted the above msg in r&#x2F;nordvpn<p>FeedbackSorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r&#x2F;nordvpn.Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose.<p>Mopping a serious problem under the carpet?",
