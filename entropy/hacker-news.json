For example, it is not possible to purchase via Amazon.de or Amazon.com for delivery to the UK due to regulations (same for eBay.co.uk).<p>What <i>non-prescription</i> sleep supplements have you tried? Which ones worked for you that you recommend?<p>For example, CBD (cannabidiol) oil is widely available without prescription and is purported to aid sleep. If you have tried it, have you found it helpful?<p>Any other non-prescription supplements you have tried (with success)? Thank you.",
