      "text": "Google search used to be one of the wonders of the modern digital world, but (and I admit this is subjective) it feels like the quality of results has decreased drastically over the years. I just can&#x27;t find stuff as easily as I used to. It still comes out on top for e.g. querying for technical information but for other things (image search) I don&#x27;t even bother with it anymore. It also feels like certain kinds of queries are subject to malicious SEO practices where it becomes impossible to find results that aren&#x27;t from the same group of tabloids&#x2F;media outlets.<p>What happened? Did they let their golden goose starve to death? Or is this all in my head and Google is actually fine for everyone else?",

I originally started with Objective C and Java and then switched to Swift and Kotlin.<p>I am looking into trying out Flutter for the second time, so am curious how others who made the switch like it?<p>Also, has Flutter improved their web development? Last time I tried it, it was all a canvas which was drawing all elements instead of HTML elements. This seemed pretty bad for accessibility and SEO. Is that still the case?<p>How&#x27;s accessibility for the iOS and Android apps built in Flutter?",
