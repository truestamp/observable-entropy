      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;ve always been curious about bug hunting. Finding vulns. I have some foundational knowledge like fuzzing, basic web security and reading assembly, but I am also aware of all the improvements in software and web security and there are so many new tech stacks, languages and platforms these days. Where does one begin? Is it worth learning how to find memory safety vulns given how C and friends are dying (and when they are alive things like CFG and appguard make it impossible to exploit them)?<p>Are there any modern books or sites you recommend? Should I be leaning some language (rust&#x2F;go?) or stack (k8s?) as a prerequisite?",
