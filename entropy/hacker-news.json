Some questions are developed by me and some submitted by users.\nfor some premium questions there&#x27;s a small fee that gives you access for a few months. \ni am starving for ideas on how to promote the site and increase it&#x27;s reach. the content is good, i have heard some good reviews from people saying that the practice questions helped them succeed in the exam.",

People say the hardest part is marketing but repetitive development is very boring. I will definitely choose a fun-ner side project than this if this fails. It&#x27;s such a tiring journey as a solo developer&#x2F;founder&#x2F;marketer.<p>The tech stack is Node.js and Angular.<p>Daspoll is a survey builder for everyone.",
