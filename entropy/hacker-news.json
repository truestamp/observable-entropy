Learn more above.<p>The &lt;sign-in&gt; link turns into a google form when logged in.\nI was able to fill it in and specify that I&#x27;m only interested in personal use.<p>----<p>From the same page - it also seems like they&#x27;ll provide a way to migrate to a non-Workspace account:<p>&gt; If I don’t want to upgrade to a paid subscription, can I transfer my data?<p>&gt; In the coming months, we&#x27;ll provide an option for you to move your non-Google Workspace paid content and most of your data to a no-cost option. This new option won&#x27;t include premium features like custom email or multi-account management.<p>&gt; You&#x27;ll be able to evaluate this option prior to July 1, 2022 and prior to account suspension. We&#x27;ll update this article with details in the coming months.",
