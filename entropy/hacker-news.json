      "text": "(As a consultant) I&#x27;ve been asked to write a business case on switching the underlying technology of a product from a somewhat mature open source codebase to a custom implementation.<p>Engineering is convinced the current underlying technology will eventually kill the product it backs (re: customization of their product has been more difficult than it should be due to the underlying tech and finding people proficient at this underlying tech or training them in it has been difficult). However, the &quot;business side&quot; of the company needs convincing because they are focused on short-term goals.<p>With that in mind, I&#x27;m trying to better understand my audience&#x27;s language and thought processes and was wondering if y&#x27;all knew of resources that talked about similar problems formally.<p>(If it helps I&#x27;ve mostly been on the science&#x2F;engineering side of businesses for nearly a decade so this is really my first exposure to needing to convince the &quot;business side&quot; in a formal manner with their own language)<p>(Also, if it helps, this open source technology seems to have a massive hype machine behind it; it&#x27;s not hard to find engineers&#x2F;scientists having very serious problems with it but it is masked by how a certain search engine is pushing tons of flattering articles to the front of the search)",
