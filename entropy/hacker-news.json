      "text": "So, when I started my studies about seven years back, i was already concerned of my privacy, not using any social media. Even rejected WhatsApp, even though all my friends where communicating with it.<p>Within my studies, I started to grasp the possibilities for companies to collect data about me. After a few years and beeing a full time linux user, I started to even read terms of agreement, still sticking to licenses I wanted to support and daily tell closer people around me to neglect the offered, free possibilities to form our own future (and strenghten the power of users). I got some weird prompt at YouTube, that I am a probant of dismissing advertising on youtube.<p>This lasted up until today. Meanwhile, I moved multiple times, therefore changed IP&#x27;s and internet providers.\nOn saturday, a friend from university moved to my location. He is a heavy internet user.\nToday, I got ads on YouTube and I am wondering: Is my persona mixed? Is it due to his internet usage? Has google just got too many requests from me? May I restore my previous state at youtube without any intervention once my friend has established hisself in my location? And why did they offer me such a relationship for years, up until now?<p>Post Scriptum: I _think_ I remember, that I accepted these prompts at least two times: &quot;You are..., so we do not show you any advertising&quot;. Since I did not care really much, there is no evidence of my statement. And I dont care, If google connects me to his usage. Just letting you know, that a company put honey on my mouth. Thoughts, Inputs? Also: I do not have an official account, but by some third party app, which does not collect data, nor connects to push notifications.<p>Sincerly",
