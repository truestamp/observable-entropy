      "text": "I currently manage a team of product managers at a major tech company. I have been working on trying to get promoted to director (which is the next title up) and a lot of it seems to be networking with various VPs to get them to vouch for me. My manager seems a bit passive in getting me promoted - he has given me scope and it’s now up to me to set up the right conversations to make the case easy for him. I am not sure if this is the way things are supposed to be - part of me thinks he should be taking a more active role in setting up the right conversations to get me promoted.<p>However, as I reflect on this promotion process, I find two things:<p>- I am mostly motivated to get promoted because it is the next step. I look at my manager’s life and I don’t envy him. He works crazy hours and it’s taking its toll on him. \n- I am mostly trying to get promoted to not stagnate. But honestly, if it were culturally acceptable and I didn’t feel the need to keep up with the Joneses, I would be happy in my role for the next 20 years.<p>So my question is to this group - how have you thought of being promoted? Is it worth it to not stagnate? Is the self-promotion to VPs with your boss waiting for it to happen the norm if you do want to get promoted?",
