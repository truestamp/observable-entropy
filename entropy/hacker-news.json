      "text": "Like many of you, I&#x27;m excited about web decentralization and independence. Not only in terms of blockchain, but in old-school, self-hosted (possibly) web1 terms.<p>The problem is, I, unlike you, am web <i>il</i>literate. As are most everyone I know. We have no idea how to participate in much of what&#x27;s talked about on here regarding taking back some power when it comes to the web.<p>So, in addition to weeding through and piecing together a zillion stray comments on HN and random blog posts (which I&#x27;m happy to do), I&#x27;m curious to know if anyone is teaching courses, mentoring, or can provide resources for the web &quot;illiterati&quot; of which I am a member.<p>After all, if this stuff is gonna have a stake, we need morons like me to understand it all better.<p>Care to help?",
