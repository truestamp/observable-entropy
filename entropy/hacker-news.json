I said they weren’t home and they asked me to take down their name and number.<p>As they were telling me their phone number I was saying “ok” after each pause but without writing the message down.<p>When we were done they politely asked me to read the number back.<p>After stammer and saying “uh” a bunch of times, they never addressed that I was lying to them and simply restarted. I took down their name and number this time.<p>25 years later, I still remember the feeling I had, but looking back am most impressed that the lesson didn’t actually take any words. Perhaps it was the lack of a lesson that made it stick.",
