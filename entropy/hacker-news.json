      "text": "I&#x27;ve just started my personal blog (link in bio), never done this before, but I&#x27;m looking forward to eventually get some money from my blogging activities. My first idea was to serve some ethical ads - I don&#x27;t want anything that tracks the visitors, obviously. Something like a sponsorship banner, or, maybe, a precisely targeted context ad with the exact hit to the tune of my blog.<p>I&#x27;m talking about something like the banners in the header of FastAPI website[1], look pretty neat. Is it just cold emailing for those, who use the said framework, or are there providers of such sponsored banners?<p>Where should I look for the advertisers providing ethical ads? Which companies have you dealt with? I&#x27;m aware of EthicalAds.io[2], but it looks like I&#x27;d have to be an established publisher to qualify.<p>Maybe, you&#x27;ll advise against serving such ads and share your experience of utilizing some other type of blog monetization?<p>Thanks in advance!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fastapi.tiangolo.com&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethicalads.io&#x2F;",
