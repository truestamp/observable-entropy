      "text": "I saw a job posting for MedNet. This seems like an interesting idea. I&#x27;m curious about the details and benefits though.<p>What are the benefits over things like PubMed? The ad talks about MedNet giving access to research results and asking researchers, but I thought the results would be on PubMed. I would have thought that lack of time would prevent doctors from doing the research, and that shifting the work to researchers to provide answers would just overwhelm their end instead.<p>How does the platform determine what the best treatment is? For example, there can be many experimental treatments that may work well, but might not be approved or recommended. Or even researchers have differences of opinions. I thought the specialty, board, or state would have established&#x2F;adopted protocols form many things. I know this happens for some states&#x2F;levels like with EMS and nursing. As well as informally through board certification and ongoing education.",
