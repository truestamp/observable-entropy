      "text": "I have been trying to find freelancers for various tasks on fiverr for a few days now and it seems hopeless. I wonder if the whole platform is just fake.<p>The profiles and gigs all look like they are done by skilled people with hilariously bad English. Ok, maybe that is a thing. Virtual assistants, programmers etc who have expertise in their area but are not well versed in English? Maybe.<p>But as soon as I start communicating with them, everything breaks down. When I send them a long job description with details and questions, I get back a one-liner like:<p>&quot;Yes sir, can do!&quot;<p>And when I reply:<p>&quot;So how do we go about it? Have you looked through the documents? How would we start?&quot;.<p>I get something like:<p>&quot;I can do for $10!&quot;.<p>:)<p>What is going on?<p>How do you find real freelancers on the web?",
