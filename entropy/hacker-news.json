      "text": "Does anyone have a good idea of how much .NET development is happening on non-Windows machines (or in non-Windows dev environments)?<p>I&#x27;m talking about the environment where code is written and debugged - not the environment where it is published or ultimately ran.<p>For example, I could imagine .NET back-end code being developed on Macs or Linux then deployed to AWS.<p>I enjoy the .NET language, but I much prefer a Linux dev environment over a Windows one (Ruby and occasionally others languages uses in the Linux dev environment). The release of Visual Studio 2022 for Mac has made me wonder how much demand there is for writing .NET code in a non-Windows environment. I also realize there are other alternatives, like JetBrains or VS Code.",
