      "text": "Hey Hackers! Two weeks ago or so, I posted on Reddit asking for feedback about &quot;Tinder for professionals&quot;.<p>Many Redditors gave amazing input. I began researching a lot and found out that LinkedIn is the only recognized global player. There are copycats, but my goal would never be to build something as boring (IMO) as LinkedIn. I want to create something different, targeted towards a younger generation. TL;DR - I want to build something cool.<p>I started working on the project with my friend around the same time I posted (just designing some app screens and researching WebRTC), and yesterday I launched the website for it - see the first comment.<p>Creating the website took me roughly 15 minutes (no-code, completely free - using Notion, Popsy, and Google Forms). It&#x27;s far from perfect, but I think it does the job, and I can continuously iterate on it later when needed.<p>Please go check it out and let me know what you think. Also, I kindly ask you to provide as much feedback as you can. We&#x27;re still very early, so we&#x27;re open to any feature ideas that might make the product better for YOU to use it.",
