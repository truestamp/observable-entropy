      "text": "So, I was just looking at AirTags for putting in my 4-year old&#x27;s backpack. I&#x27;m not really going to do it but after seeing abduction movies, the thought certainly crossed my mind.<p>However, based on the following Apple page:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT212227<p>It seems like if an iPhone user abducts someone with an AirTag in their pocket, the abductor would get notified that an AirTag is traveling with them.<p>I guess it can&#x27;t be used for this purpose???  Any thoughts or has anyone effectively used it for tracking their young kid?",
