      "text": "Let&#x27;s say CircleCi gets 100,000 companies paying their 30$&#x2F;month subscription (I think that&#x27;s a pretty ambitious number, or am I naive?) this puts them at 36 million $ yearly income, even today they have over 600 employees - assuming an average of 180k$&#x2F;y per employee this puts them paying 108 million $ just on salaries. Which part of the story am I missing? what makes investors believe they are going to see big returns?",

      "text": "The elevator in my condo building has been acting weird for well over a month now, it randomly won&#x27;t go to some floors sometimes.<p>As you can imagine this is incredibly annoying and I&#x27;ve complained numerous times to the condo association and the management. The response is always the same, the elevator company are not able to fix it yet, for &quot;reasons&quot; but it will be fixed as soon as they can. After a painful 15 minute wait to get to my floor, I finally called the elevator company and asked them why they&#x27;re unable to service the elevator in a brand new 46 floor building for over a month.<p>The answer, the computer manufacturer is unable to get chips, nor do they know when they will, so the computer unit is backordered, indefinitely.<p>Wondering if anyone else has daily life chip shortage anecdotes?",

      "text": "I&#x27;m curious as to what do you think about the following situation, so I&#x27;ll present it as a timeline:<p>2016: I buy my first iPhone. Amazing piece of tech, does everything I want it to do. It just works.<p>2019: I buy a AirPods. They integrate amazingly with the phone. They just work.<p>2020: I want to release an iOS app, so I buy a Macbook Air (Intel, irrelevant). I like it (slim, long battery life, does what I need it to do, albeit somehow slow).<p>2020: I want to do more stuff on the Mac, including audio &#x2F; video calls. I buy a pair of jack earpods.<p>Now, I can&#x27;t use the AirPods all day because the battery just doesn&#x27;t handle it, understandably. I turn to the earpods. Decent sound, terrible microphone quality. These become a necessity as my app (and therefore business) grow bigger and bigger. One year later in 2021 I&#x27;m using the Mac camera and jack earpods, and I constantly get complaints either on video or audio quality from my microphone.<p>As a genuine question, how does Apple want me to deal with this situation? I paid somewhere around $2200 for this tech, should I not expect it to just work and do what it should do? How do you deal with this?",
