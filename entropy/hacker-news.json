      "text": "Ok so I&#x27;m looking for advice. I work at FAANG like company. Problem is I&#x27;m a JS dev, but here it&#x27;s a different language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;architecture&#x2F;build tools. All of which I&#x27;m learning, but not proficient by any means. I&#x27;ve been on team for few months. Main reason for contention is that I miss sprints, tickets which I&#x27;m assigned by manager. no say. Then because sprints is a dumb idea, some tickets are more involved and don&#x27;t get done. I&#x27;ve been told about we need to think about future with the company and fit balabla. I&#x27;ve resigned myself to whatever outcome happens and just to do my best. But I&#x27;m wondering what should I do..<p>- leave now<p>- wait and get fired<p>- accept job at startup 30% pay cut &amp; no brand<p>- start a company<p>- take vacation for few months<p>honestly I think I&#x27;m starting to hate tech... hate typescript, hate docker&#x2F;kubernettes, hate webpack, hate microservices, hate AWS, hate TDD... basically hate everything unnecessary. It all feels like a cult and feel like tech is filled career people, then what it used to be passionate hackers and learners. Like all people who would normally go to business are now here..",
