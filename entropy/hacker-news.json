But Google&#x27;s own DNS query at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dns.google&#x2F;query?name=xordle.xyz returns a status code 3 -- NXDOMAIN, or no such domain.<p>I tried transferring to a different registrar but it can&#x27;t be transferred on account of it &quot;not existing&quot;. I tried using Google Support; they weren&#x27;t helpful in the slightest.<p>Do I have any options aside from just getting a new domain name if it doesn&#x27;t resolve itself quickly?",
