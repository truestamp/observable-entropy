I&#x27;m sure people who work fully remote can list additional problems.<p>In physical offices, we have whiteboards that help us explain and keep others&#x27; attention, we have facial expressions that help us know when people have difficulties understanding, etc.<p>So have you discovered a tool or a way to significantly improve communication when working with a fully remote team?
