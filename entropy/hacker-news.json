      "text": "If you&#x27;re implementing GraphQL on the backend or querying a GraphQL API for data on the frontend of a reactive single-page application, what&#x27;s your overall impression of it?<p>Has the extra complexity been worth it over building a RESTful or RESTless (e.g. RPC) API?<p>The strong typing on the client and server, well-defined protocol with introspection built-in, and flexibility of the query language seem like a boon for quick frontend development.<p>However, it seems to come with some complexities - reworking middleware into something compatible with resolvers (authentication, rate limiting, etc.), concerns about queries being used in ways you don&#x27;t expect (N+1 problems, solvable via data loaders or query complexity limits), and common methods for viewing metrics (e.g. tracking stats by URI, status code, and verb) need to be reconsidered.<p>How&#x27;s it working out for you?",
