      "text": "I&#x27;m seeking direction and guidance. I&#x27;m between roles. I&#x27;ve been trying to carve out an unconventional role for myself, because it&#x27;s what I enjoy doing and what I&#x27;m best at. I&#x27;m not sure what role best matches what I&#x27;m looking for. Advice welcome.<p>I&#x27;ve come through software development. I juked the Management track and stayed on the IC track. Senior, Team Lead, Principal. But I don&#x27;t want to strictly do software engineering anymore.<p>I&#x27;d like to make the lives of customers and employees better, through making possible what was not possible before, or reducing burden.<p>I&#x27;d like to do that by helping businesses build systems _beyond just software_ that, having both internal and external effects. This could be having a hand in the product offering, business organisation and operation, commissioning software teams or shaping organisational culture. I&#x27;d also like to help coach the software engineering teams that build the software, because that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve come from.<p>I feel like I&#x27;m looking for something between a principal engineer, a product manager and an engineering director. I want to keep my boots on the ground, but help shape what is going on above.<p>I&#x27;m applying for principal engineer roles, however the companys I&#x27;ve interviewed for are looking for this role to be primarily focussed on moving tickets across a JIRA board, which isn&#x27;t really what I&#x27;m shooting for. I want to help businesses and teams move the appropriate tickets across JIRA boards. I&#x27;m getting really great feedback, but they just aren&#x27;t hiring for _that_ role.<p>Is there another role I could consider in my position?",
