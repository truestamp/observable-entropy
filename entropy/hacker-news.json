      "text": "I have a single rural rental property that I want to market to SWEs or similar remote-only knowledge workers, particularly those looking to relocate from an urban location and get (far) away from it all.  For context, I manage the property from next door for my out-of-state parents; it&#x27;s a truly idyllic place to live and work.<p>I expect that I am not alone in either having such a property to rent or desiring to find such a place to live, so I suspect that niche services exist for these demographics.  I have looked around, but the options are overwhelmingly diverse.<p>As I respect and value the HN community&#x27;s perspective and opinion, where would you be looking for such a property?",
