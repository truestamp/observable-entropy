      "text": "They recently started trying to get me to give them information from a second credit card before I can complete a purchase and they will not let me purchase otherwise. This is annoying and so I just switched to Grubhub. I am trying to understand why DoorDash did this. I guess it&#x27;s supposed to have something to do with security, but I have a hunch that they are losing many customers because of this. Many people simply do not have a second credit card. I do, but I do not want to bother to dig it out just to make DoorDash happy. Aren&#x27;t they losing a bunch of money by doing this?",

      "text": "I have worked at a BigTechCo for about 3 years and feel like my engineering skills are slowly and steadily deteriorating. Multiple people in my team, org, and other BigTechCos have expressed the same concern.<p>Essentially, everything we do is between other mammoth systems and thus most “work” is actually configuring systems to talk to each other or talking to other teams about guarantees, capacity etc. The actual engineering work is minimal and the development speed is glacial.<p>Previously I worked at a small consultancy, a green field company, and startups. Small teams, full stack, very fast paced, interesting work (dynamic programming, exotic schedulers, path planning, front end&#x2F;back end, databases, events&#x2F;streams, native mobile).<p>Now I feel I just slog through esoteric config or some custom DDL, language, or tool nobody else uses. No team can do anything meaningful by themselves, everything requires meetings and infinite Google Docs. The pay is more than 2x what I was making before and the promos keep coming but it all just feels like BS.<p>Does anyone else have this experience?<p>Note: I have definitely improved in cross team communication and collaboration etc. as well as big org politics. So not a total loss.",
