      "text": "My first impressions of the XML Paper Specification (XPS) were ok. But after so many years, MS has not updated it to catch up with Adobe&#x27;s PDF. I tried converting a docx document to XPS and PDF using MS Word, and the XPS takes considerably more time to compile than the PDF, and the end result also has horribly lower quality and slower scrolling&#x2F;zooming speed than the PDF version. Not to mention that fonts are not rendered as vectors in the XPS format either; they are jagged esp. upon zooming in.<p>Why is this the case? I would very much like to see something other than PDF get popular.",
