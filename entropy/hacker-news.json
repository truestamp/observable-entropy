      "text": "I&#x27;m currently an eng manager at a pretty mature startup that&#x27;s trying to transition into a big-tech. I&#x27;ve been an eng manager at a FAANG and transitioned from being a Sr Individual Contributor to an eng manager with about 9 years of experience in total.<p>In the last year or so, I&#x27;ve lost the excitement I used to feel in the software industry and was hoping that a company change might reset a few things but it did not. I am at a crossroads wherein I want to try out a different career path that leverages my experience but is different from my current role (I don&#x27;t know which one yet). In the long-term I want to transition into a role in Sports analytics.. What are my potential options in terms of a career switch?",
