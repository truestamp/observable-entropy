Upload the file from frontend to S3?\n2. First upload the file to backend and then upload the file from backend to S3?<p>What will be the best option? In my opinion the first approach is better as it doesn&#x27;t require extra load on backend if the file is larger, but I am not sure about the security issues to keep the AWS credentials in the frontend code.<p>Any suggestions are welcome :)",
