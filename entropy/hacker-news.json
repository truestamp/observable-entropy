      "text": "I nearly stopped shopping on Amazon due to poor quality of reviews. However, I had good luck with seeing what people are saying on reddit about products....but that seem to no longer work for me, as many products well regarded or suggested turned out to be crap.<p>Youtube quality also has dropped significantly for me. All the big channels generally provide mostly positive reviews for things like cars, pc hardware and games.<p>I&#x27;m now mostly buying big ticket items at Costco due to return policy.<p>I use consumer reports but the product coverage is quite limited.<p>I miss the days of early internet full of nerds before marketing teams figured out they can astroturf and maximize sales.<p>Do any of you still have a reliable way of finding reviews about products online?",
