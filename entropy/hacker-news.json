I believe the web app has the full functionality of the native app. So I&#x27;m thinking about making a manifest so it can be &quot;installed&quot; as a PWA.<p>Making the manifest shouldn&#x27;t take much time so it should be harmless, if nothing else, but I wonder if it&#x27;s worth advertising via a banner or investing in deeper PWA features like offline availability.<p>So from a business perspective: if you have a PWA, do people bother installing it? Particularly when you also have a native mobile app. Is it worth spending effort on?",
