They will be endowed with agency over originally human APIs: screen+keyboard&#x2F;mouse in the digital realm and humanoid bodies in the physical realm. And gradually they will swap us out.\n</code></pre>\nI work professionally in the machine learning field. Some of my colleagues and myself are realizing that we&#x27;re pursuing goals that will reduce the value of human intelligence and creativity, commoditizing them.<p>Pandora&#x27;s Box has been opened.<p>As a society we can reject this technology. Reject automated artwork like Dall-E 2, reject automated literature, and so on. Reject technologies that replace the human mind instead of assisting it.<p>In your opinion, would a social movement organized around this idea find traction?",
