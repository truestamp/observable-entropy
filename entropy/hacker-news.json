I was reading this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;22807858&#x2F;tiktok-influencer-microsoft-excel-instagram-decoder-podcast and started wondering if creators would benefit from having a platform where they could create content centered around audio.<p>For the STT side: you would speak and have all your words transcribed in real-time, or post-processing is done to the audio to generate the whole transcript. This supports foreign languages besides English. For real-time transcription, you can even edit the text in-place (for situations where you want to correct text as you speak).<p>For the TTS side: you would supply the text and given an mp3 audio file in return that you could embed in a blog post or wherever your text exists. This also supports different languages, and the models can be trained to sound convincingly like you.<p>Not every person would use both, so I&#x27;m trying to gauge which would have more demand and why. Also how someone would use both if provided.<p>I have a lot of friends who write a lot with decent-sized audiences who said they&#x27;d be interested in this. But I was curious to see if anyone here would be interested as well.",
