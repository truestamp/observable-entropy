      "text": "I realized today that my upvotes on comments have either delayed or no effect, while my upvotes on submissions seem immediate, but with the odd inability to unvote without a long delay or no effect. To test this, I did the following:<p>1. COMMENTS: \nUpvoted several recent comments of different users through different threads. Refreshed their user profile in separate tab (multiple times) and observed no increase&#x2F;decrease in karma. Same results when going back and forth refreshing same tab. Removing cache nor using a separate browser (not logged in) had any effect.<p>2. \nSUBMISSIONS:\nUsing the same method as above, I upvoted several submissions in new (but older) status. Strangely, the submission would rise by one point, but after unvoting, would remain unaffected, but possibly retract with a significant delay.<p>I can certainly imagine a purpose or reason for delays, but I&#x27;d never noticed previously. My effect (or ineffect) on comments does seem new.<p>Is this behavior induced moderation voodoo, or standard?",
