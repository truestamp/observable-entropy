I plan to do this by making him work on a small pet project of mine. Frankly he has almost zero skills right now and is not really employable. Is it right of me not to pay him for his work? Is it unethical even if I dont plan to make money on the pet project ?<p>Not that this is an indivdual to individual interaction and no company is involved.",
