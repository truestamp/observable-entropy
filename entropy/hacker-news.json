I’ve opened cases with Airbnb review team, I’ve called in to their support line, sent emails but no response. I’ve been a customer since 2012 and the lack of customer service or follow up is appalling. I’ve asked around and it seems like this is actually a common issue where many folks are randomly banned with no recourse.",
