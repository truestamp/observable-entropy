Shouldn&#x27;t Kubernetes <i>reduce</i> the workload and need <i>less</i> men power?&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the old way does indeed look messy, I am just wondering why there is a need for so much dev ops nowadays ...<p>Thanks for your answers.",

      "text": "I started working for a tech company immediately out of high school. The company was a startup that has seen notable growth.<p>I joined one year into the business and have been there for the last three years. I took on a lot of responsibility early on because I was excited and I learned a lot. I worked on tasks that had a direct impact on revenue.<p>Now I&#x27;m feeling burnt out and question whether I started on this path too early. I had really high expectations of myself and now I am wrestling with this feeling of guilt that I can&#x27;t get motivated like I used to. I&#x27;ve tried doing the things with tech I love -- like working on my website -- but lose energy quickly.<p>I know I&#x27;m early in my career but I feel tired and unmotivated at work. Work seems like a never-ending treadmill of tasks, many of which are more bureaucratic now and don&#x27;t interest me. What should I do?",
