      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m one of the project creators. MLEM is a tool that helps you deploy your ML models. It’s a Python library + Command line tool.<p>MLEM can package an ML model into a Docker image or a Python package, and deploy it to, for example, Heroku.\nMLEM saves all model metadata to a human-readable text file: Python environment, model methods, model input &amp; output data schema and more.\nMLEM helps you turn your Git repository into a Model Registry with features like ML model lifecycle management.<p>Our philosophy is that MLOps tools should be built using the Unix approach - each tool solves a single problem, but solves it very well. MLEM was designed to work hands on hands with Git - it saves all model metadata to a human-readable text files and Git becomes a source of truth for ML models. Model weights file can be stored in the cloud storage using a Data Version Control tool or such - independently of MLEM.<p>Please check out the project: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iterative&#x2F;mlem and the website: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlem.ai<p>I’d love to hear your feedback!",
