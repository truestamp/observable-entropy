      "text": "Background: Currently working as a 3D Graphics Engineer at a FAANG. I have done my Bachelors with Electronics as my Major and have a total experience of 10 years.<p>I am doing very well in my current IC role and prefer to transition into a Research Engineer in Visual Computing space. I have done some internal homework at where I work and the feedback I get is it&#x27;s worth doing a Masters which have a thesis component.<p>I have really enjoyed the subject of 3D Graphics and a deep dive seems exciting.<p>I am looking at doing the following two courses: 9 month M.Phil at University of Cambridge [1] and follow up that with a Masters in Visual Computing [2].<p>There are no constraints whatsoever for me to pursue these full time for 3 years.<p>I would like to draw upon the wisdom of those in the HN crowd who have followed similar routes to become Research Engineers (your subject of research is orthogonal). Did you do a Masters, did  it make a difference? Or what alternative approaches you followed? Any insight welcome, thanks in advance!!!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;courses&#x2F;directory&#x2F;cscsmpacs<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inf.ethz.ch&#x2F;studies&#x2F;master&#x2F;master-cs-2020.html",
