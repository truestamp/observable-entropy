      "text": "Around this time a year ago, I forked and built Simple Badges on top of the Simple Icons website. Existing projects on this often try to manually maintain a single, huge Markdown file containing pre-assembled Shields.io badges for people to pick. They usually require constant manual effort to follow upstream updates and may lack some icons as a result. Simple Badges automatically tracks upstream icon updates, provides a badge preview page that easy to navigate, and makes it easy to get all four styles of badges in Markdown or HTML img format.<p>If you happen to be refurbishing your profile - give Simple Badges a try! Suggestion and contribution are welcomed :-)",
