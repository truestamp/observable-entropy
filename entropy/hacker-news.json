      "text": "Being a SW Eng I spent hours on a chair. In home-office. COVID lockdowns made this worse. Added extra stress due to bad future outlook and a lack of direction in my career plus dozens of other blockers that navigating gets more difficult as I grow older.<p>Anyway. The point of the matter is that I crack and meltdown quite often. And that makes my problems multiply because I then have to deal with apologies etc.<p>How do you deal with meltdowns? How do you calm yourself down? I&#x27;m not talking about being a Buddha (I&#x27;m as far away from that as I could be unfortunately). I&#x27;m talking about doing the bare minimum so that I don&#x27;t cause myself and the people around me extra problems.<p>For the most part I have managed to keep this away from my (shitty) job so it has not affected my (dead in the water) career. But it is taking a toll on my family relations and I hate me for that.<p>No phychotherapy please. I won&#x27;t go near their arrogance.<p>Any practical tips that work on you are highly appreciated.<p>For context I&#x27;m 45 yrs old, male, relatively new dad in a backwater EU country.<p>TIA",
