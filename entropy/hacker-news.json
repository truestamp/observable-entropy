Therefore, I&#x27;m in search for a  docking station &#x2F; usb-c hub that is:\n* Compatible with Macbook Pro 2019 and Lenovo P620, both with usb-c entry.\n* Works with 2 monitors with either display port or hdmi connection\n* Ideally, easy to switch back and forward the workstation and laptop connections.<p>There are many options online, but thought this would be a great place to get recommendations!",
