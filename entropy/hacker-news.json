      "text": "Examples:\n- Tim Berners Lee laments how the web became predominantly read-only rather than editable (more like a wiki perhaps) and is also working on Solid (the idea that instead of having your data spread around the internet, you keep it safe in a pod and decide what sites can access), also promoted the &#x27;semantic web&#x27;.\n- Marc Andreessen has mentioned payments, real identity and annotation. On the other hand was bearish on the semantic web.\n- Alan Kay argued for something like a self-compiling and object-oriented web in which html standards and browsers aren&#x27;t necessary.<p>For context:\nThe WWW is over 30 and we are now so used to it that not only is it easy to forget the distinction between WWW and the Internet and that for all the standards, protocols and working groups that exist today, at the beginning the web was little more than an app (the first browser), plus documentation on a file format that it could read (html). And like any app, specific design decisions went into it. So although much of the discussion today focuses on complicated standards and browser features, I believe the thought experiment is interesting, especially now that the web has lost most of its share of internet usage to native apps: Hackers, if you could redesign the whole stack of the web today from scratch - what would you do?",
