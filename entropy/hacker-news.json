      "text": "Part of why I have liked my job in the past is because I feel useful. I have a colleague that is so incredibly good and applies himself constantly (works after hours, weekends, during vacations). He writes at least 5x more code than me and its giving me an inferiority complex something fierce. How the heck do I break out of this mentality and become more productive? I feel like I am going off the rails and I often sit down to work and do nothing all day feeling this way. I don&#x27;t want to end up on a PIP. Any suggestions are very welcome. Thanks!",
