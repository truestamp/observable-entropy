      "text": "Peer review made sense in the paper age.<p>However, it is severely outdated in the Internet age when corrections and changes can be published and tracked instantly. Moreover, the noble goal of filtering out junk yields the undesirable consequence of conformism, gated by whoever happens to review a submission.<p>If the objective is to surface quality research, how do we update our systems to reflect technological advances?<p>The tradeoff of accelerated publishing is more misinformation, both intentional and unintentional. But the benefit of faster, more valuable knowledge reactions (chemical reactions but for knowledge) seems to merit deeper exploration.",
