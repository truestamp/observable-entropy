      "text": "I encountered several types of interview through companies of different values (small startup to big tech). First kind is Leetcode-style interview where your task is to write algorithm&#x2F;data structure to solve given problems. Second kind discards algorithmic problems treating them as &quot;uneffective&quot; method to choose developers who can produce maintainable, well scalable code. They prefer problems focusing on knowing execution environment like &quot;make autocomplete work for this React template&quot;, spaghetti-mess of setTimeout&#x2F;promises in JS etc. Third kind don&#x27;t ask coding problems from mature developers at all, they only talk about architecture&#x2F;internal mechanics of programs from previous jobs or pet-projects of applicant. And asking theoretical questions for basic knowledge of developed systems like &quot;what happens if I type a link in browser&#x27;s address input and then press &quot;Enter&quot;?&quot;. They think that you can&#x27;t detect good developer by how much of execution environment internals or algorithms they know&#x2F;they can design, but by their high-level ability to build business programs and systems. It is biasly assumed that interviewee already knows some basics of execution environment and algorithms. Etc.<p>What style of technical interview do you prefer and what are objectives for that?",
