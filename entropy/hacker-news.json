      "text": "Normally people deploy applications to the cloud, and testing those applications in the cloud implies that the underlying cloud ressources have been properly created. Some (large) enterprise governance models however forsee that infrastructure teams first deploy &quot;landing zones&quot; and application teams deploy into those landing zones. It seems useful that an infrastructure team should be able to verify, with tests, that their landing zone (and other shared resources like identity management and monitoring) has been deployed and configured properly. Our teams currently develop custom scripts that connect to the cloud&#x27;s resoruces and resource manager and run tests against them. Are there tools (eg. Terraform plugins) which streamline regression tests definition and execution?",
