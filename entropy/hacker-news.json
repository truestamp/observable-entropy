      "text": "I was talking with my friend once about the difference between cars and computers (specifically ricing), in that people tend to have a natural awe of &quot;good looking&quot; cars, even going beyond the actual specs of the engine, brakes, aero, etc. Youc an see this in articles like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2004&#x2F;nov&#x2F;13&#x2F;motoring.automotive.<p>However, we don&#x27;t see this same reaction to software. As engineers we appreciate software that&#x27;s well designed, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to invoke the same primal feeling as cars.<p>What are your thoughts on this? Is it possible for software to have the same effect on people as cars?",
