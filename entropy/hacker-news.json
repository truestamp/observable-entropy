I think it has to do with the fact that women are generally more empathetic towards their audience, and as far as I&#x27;ve seen, they put in extra effort to transfer the material&#x2F;content to them. Not to say that males are not good at this, but for the purpose of this question, I was wondering if there are any courses&#x2F;videos&#x2F;textbooks&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;etc. that you know of which is produced by a female?",
