      "text": "Hey HN! Esolang Park is an online visual debugger interface for esoteric programming languages, that I&#x27;ve been working on for the past few months. For every supported language, Esolang Park provides the powerful Monaco code editor, syntax checking, debugging functionality and a visualisation of the runtime state. The core is language-agnostic - a &quot;language provider&quot; only needs to implement the esolang&#x27;s parser, interpreter and visualisation UI (and some other little stuff).<p>Apart from trying to boost DX for esolangs, the idea is for this to grow into a platform where people can discover and play around with a variety of esolangs without leaving the browser. That&#x27;s quite far away though - the project is quite early in development and currently only has 5 languages (Befunge-93, Brainf*ck, Chef, Deadfish and Shakespeare). Some features like non-debugging execution mode (0ms interval) are missing too.<p>Currently the entire source code[0] (core + language providers) is written in TypeScript and React. Esolang code execution happens in a web worker. I&#x27;m planning to add support for WASM-based language providers for better performance, particularly for non-debugging execution. There&#x27;s also a wiki[1] containing a description of the core design and a guide for implementing and contributing new language providers.<p>Looking to hear some feedback on the idea and current implementation - bug reports are welcome too!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nilaymaj&#x2F;esolang-park\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nilaymaj&#x2F;esolang-park</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nilaymaj&#x2F;esolang-park&#x2F;wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nilaymaj&#x2F;esolang-park&#x2F;wiki</a>",
