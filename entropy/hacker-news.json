It&#x27;s showing its age, but I have a hard time finding a device to personalize.<p>Tried Pinebook Pro, and while the screen is bearable,  its keyboard is really not good for long stretches of work. And then, it can not sleep properly, so it&#x27;s not really ready to be the daily driver.<p>Would like to try Getac s410, but it&#x27;s difficult to find A-ware refurbished devices.<p>Are the tinkerers running out of options?",
