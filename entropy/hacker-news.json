It wasn&#x27;t so great indoors, but for outdoors work, it was splendid.  I believe the original Game Boy Advance also had one.<p>Is anybody making screen-sized transflective monitors these days?  Any demand for such a thing aside from myself?  inb4 google: shopping only seems to return mini-displays for arduino projects and such.",
