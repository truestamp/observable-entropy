I feel like there’s nothing i can contribute to the discussion anymore and have decided to take a break<p>I’d also like to say i’m sorry for the malicious comments and posts i’ve made over past two months. I feel remorseful for breaking the posting rules multiple times over again and derailing discussions<p>I’ve been addicted to this website and couldn’t bring myself to stop. Now i can, thanks to the measures applied to my account<p>I plan to use the break to put more effort into my upcoming product and read books i’d wanted to read, but couldn’t because of the addiction<p>Again, sorry for causing trouble within community. I won’t post here anymore unless i have something really meaningful to say nobody otherwise could<p>Yours,\nMish Ushakov",
