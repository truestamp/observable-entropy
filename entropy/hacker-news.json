      "text": "Hello everyone. I am Kyle Hogeboom, the founder of Summa (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theeducationstartup.com), an education startup making humankind smarter.<p>For you fellow nerds out there, we are making Asimov’s Encyclopedia Galactica real, our very own Encyclopedia Humanum, a summary of human knowledge that we can navigate like a map and learn from in a personalized way. Our goal is to universalize knowledge and personalize learning so anyone can learn everything - because the only way to solve more problems create more culture is to have more ideas in the minds of more people.<p>Right now, we&#x27;re in development mode...and a catch-22. To get seed funding to build the demo product, we need traction, but to get traction, we need a demo product. (I know, I know, what a terribly unique problem in the startup world.) So, we&#x27;re releasing everything but and collecting names of those interested in being the first to try the revolution in education we&#x27;ve been waiting for. Just type in your name and help us launch this thing.<p>Summa is also hiring, so if you&#x27;re interested in what we&#x27;re doing, feel free to reach out through the website. Or, if you have thoughts&#x2F;criticisms, leave them below. In the meantime, keep on learning.<p>Thanks!",
