      "text": "Hi everyone, seeking some advice - newbie here so if this doesn&#x27;t belong here please tell me to delete.\n29 yo. College background: Quantitative Econ and Finance. Work background: Was a finance bro for a few years (wall street) then joined the startup world as an employee (operator) and really learned the business &#x2F; commercial skills (think biz-dev&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;ops.. did almost every division that is non-technical).<p>Looking to build something of my own in the future, but I&#x27;m in no rush and I have a very long-term view of things in that I want to achieve true mastery in this field. I have been thinking to supplement my business skills with engineering skills - to do a bootcamp and work as a SWE for 2-5 years. Rationale: this will make me a good engineer and will allow me to learn and earn at the same time, while being able to build my own projects in evenings&#x2F;weekends and upskilling, and adding the technical skills to my skill-stack which already consists of the business side of things.<p>I may be wrong but I have this vision for being a &#x27;full stack operator&#x27; - not that I&#x27;ll ever be as good of a coder as the person doing it since their teenage years, but just to be able to build mvp &#x2F; communicate with engineers &#x2F; have technical awareness etc, I think it will go a long way if I&#x27;m planning to be in this industry for several decades to come (hopefully). I have the business skills but I&#x27;m thinking of getting the technical skills too. Of course I know many people who only have business skills and build successful companies, and I know it&#x27;s not a requirement. However, I have an admiration for the very few who can build and can sell and have a long-termist view on things (think Bezos).<p>There is the classic debate of specialisation vs generalisation, however I wouldn&#x27;t call this generalisation given that it&#x27;s in the same field of building technology companies and will solidify my overall skillset. However, turning 30 soon and as Bill Gates once said: I&#x27;d rather teach an engineer marketing than teach a marketer engineering. As age goes up, some say focus and energy goes down, but I&#x27;m not sure this applies to someone in early 30s of their career.<p>Any thoughts &#x2F; advice would be sincerely appreciated. Stick to doubling down on my business skills, or supplement the business skills with technical skills? Thanks so much to all.",
