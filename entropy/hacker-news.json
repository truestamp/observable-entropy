      "text": "Since 2018 and management changes Firefox lost a lot of users. [1]\nFirefox has now 3.67% market share.[2]<p>Mozilla is mismanaged, to quote another commenter from HN:<p>&gt;Mitchell Baker (Mozilla CEO) makes $3 million a year, and Mozilla asks you to donate &quot;to help a nonprofit organization&quot;.\n&gt;&quot;On the same period, Firefox marketshare was down 85%. When asked about her salary she stated &quot;I learned that my pay was about an 80% discount to market. Meaning that competitive roles elsewhere were paying about 5 times as much. That&#x27;s too big a discount to ask people and their families to commit to.&quot;<p>&gt;&quot;By 2020 her salary had risen to over $3 million, while in the same year the Mozilla Corporation had to lay off approximately 250 employees due to shrinking revenues. Baker blamed this on the Coronavirus pandemic.&quot;<p>&gt;This lady then goes on and on talking about &quot;social justice&quot;.<p>&gt;Also Google deal produces 90% of Mozilla&#x27;s revenue. I would say Mozilla is really controlled opposition.[3]<p>Mozilla derives over 90% from it&#x27;s income from Google deal.[4]<p>If we take all these points in considerations, it seems Firefox is in peril. It can either disappear, become totally irrelevant or do what its biggest customer dictates it to do.<p>If web becomes a monoculture and only one company will be able to dictate its features, than the future isn&#x27;t exactly rosy for users and developers alike. We need Firefox and other rendering engines and browser to have a healthy competition.<p>Is it possible that some company with deep pockets forks Firefox and hires what it&#x27;s left from its development team to further develop Firefox and improve its market share?<p>Can it be in some big company&#x27;s interest to push for web competition?<p>Since many big corps derive their incomes from the web, it should be. If they let someone control the web, it can be detrimental to their businesses.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.itsfoss.com&#x2F;firefox-decline&#x2F;\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gs.statcounter.com&#x2F;browser-market-share\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28926582&amp;p=2\n[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;mozilla-signs-lucrative-3-year-google-search-deal-for-firefox",
