      "text": "This is a question for technical founders who can hopefully point me in the right direction...<p>In order to bootstrap a MVP by myself, I am learning to code.<p>I have been attending a bootcamp where they recommend grinding through leetcode to pass interviews... which obviously in my case doesn&#x27;t really apply, as I am looking to build something, not get hired. It would take me ~6 months to get comfortable doing easy&#x2F;mediums. But the problem is, those skills don&#x27;t help me build a MVP! Learning to build a project helps me build a MVP.<p>So if my goal is to quickly build a MVP as a startup founderâ€”should I bother grinding leetcode?<p>I want to bootstrap the first version myself. I don&#x27;t have a cofounder. And most importantly, I want to know my product in deep and eventually, when I have revenue and&#x2F;or funding, hire senior engineers who can take over - who I can actually talk to in deep about the code.<p>Any thoughts? And specifically, how do I optimize my learning to build a MVP?",
