      "text": "Naturally being a SWE I spend a lot of time in front of the computer, recently it seems like my eyes can&#x27;t handle much screen time though. This morning it was especially bad and after just 30 minutes I had to get off the computer and close my eyes. But even on &quot;good&quot; days I may get a couple of hours at most before it&#x27;s too much to handle.<p>I&#x27;ve tried eye drops, I&#x27;ve tried practicing good eye hygiene (blinking, looking away every X minutes, etc), I even just bought a pair of swimming goggles to hopefully trap moisture.<p>It&#x27;s making it very difficult to get much work done and I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;ll have to change professions entirely if it doesn&#x27;t fix itself soon.<p>Any suggestions? I&#x27;m seeing my optometrist on the 24th but I&#x27;m worried they&#x27;ll just tell me there&#x27;s nothing to be done.",
