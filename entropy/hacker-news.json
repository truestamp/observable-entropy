      "text": "Hello fellow HN users.<p>Is it my idea or are interviews more harder nowadays? If you had to take a technical interview for your current position would you be able to pass it and get the job?<p>If you were the one doing the interview, would you be strict and request more things so as to filter out candidates? It’s understandable because somehow you need to find the best ones for a given position, but there are some soft skills that C&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Python interview problems can’t identify.<p>I’m asking because I’ve seen many interesting positions in which I could imagine myself into (having ~20 years experience in telecoms&#x2F;soft engineering), but the entry requirements with regards to programming languages are set too high.<p>What are your experiences?",
