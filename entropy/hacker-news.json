Trouble is I have no idea what the password is...<p>I heard there are some defects in Multibit that it may be possible to exploit?  Does anyone have any details about this please?<p>Thanks :-)",

Also the system cannot control the Scarlett Solo&#x27;s microphone volume at all.<p>PS: I am using Firefox",
