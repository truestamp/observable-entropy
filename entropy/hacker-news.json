      "text": "TL;DR A stone at Vindolanda, a Roman fort just south of Hadrian’s Wall in the UK, recently made headlines. It was found by volunteer archaeologist, Dylan Herbert who wanted to remove the stone because he kept tripping over it. The stone features a penis and an inscription that translates to “Secundinus, the shitter”. It is thought to have been carved in the 3rd century CE by a Roman soldier who was clearly very committed to the insult, given how deeply it was carved. Phallus carvings are actually surprisingly common, this being the 13th found in Vindolanda alone. “Only after we removed the mud did I realize the full extent of what I&#x27;d uncovered, and I was absolutely delighted.”<p>Original article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;roman-penis-graffiti-stone-uk",
