      "text": "(Particularly with 230v)<p>I occasionally move my Mac Studio around, and it has a habbit of tripping the RCD when I plug it back in.<p>Particularly, when the power cable is already energized and I connect the C5 (&quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;) connector, I&#x27;ll get a loud pop and I&#x27;ll be plunged into darkness (well, figuratively as my sockets are on a different circuit).<p>I can avoid this by plugging the cable into the Mac first and then into the wall (or switching off the socket at the wall)<p>My electrics have been certified in the past year, and I&#x27;ve tried it in a few circuits now: both at home and at the office with the same result.<p>It seems to me that the high inrush current causes a small arc flash inside the socket inlet (hence the particularly loud pop) that creates a brief short to ground, which the RCD trips as designed.<p>I&#x27;ve never had this behaviour with any electronic devices before, I&#x27;ve been used to connecting and disconnecting the appliance inlet without issues - other than the occasional electrical crackle.<p>So can anyone verify if I&#x27;ve just got an odd&#x2F;faulty unit and it&#x27;s not some design flaw? Leave it unplugged for long enough to discharge its capacitors then plug a powered cable into the back.",
