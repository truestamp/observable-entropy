      "text": "I&#x27;ve come up with a way of dynamically bidding on spot instances across multiple clouds that results in VM compute (bare metal or containers) that&#x27;s a fraction of the normal cost (think 80%+ cheaper than reserved, 50%+ cheaper than standard spot).<p>But, to be worth the effort to turn this into a proper framework that you could use to run a container via Terraform, I&#x27;m trying to quantify what portion of the &#x27;average&#x27; cloud spend is VMs, as opposed to managed SaaS products (message queues, serverless databases, S3, etc). I don&#x27;t want to spend the time solving a problem if nobody has the problem anymore.<p>If you&#x27;re reading this and work in cloud, could you kindly comment a rough % of what you&#x27;ve seen being spent on raw VMs as opposed to SaaS services, now and historically?<p>Thanks!",
