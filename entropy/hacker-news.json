      "text": "I&#x27;d like to buy a PineNote in a few months, but development although improving isn&#x27;t there yet, so I wonder if there are other models worth of consideration from a tinkerer&#x2F;privacy conscious user point of view. I don&#x27;t mean hacking the reader or flash it with a FOSS firmware, but would love to see some features most consumer products usually lack along with others I would need.<p>0- Not tied to any online or cloud service, no online &quot;activation&quot; etc.\n1- Enough horsepower to not require too much time for page flips when reading complex pdfs.\n2- 10 inches minimum, possibly 13&quot;. I mostly read electronics books, and schematics&#x2F;graphs on smaller screens are a royal nightmare.\n3- Support for NFS&#x2F;CIFS local network shares\n4- No need for drawing functions, editing or annotations, reading alone is more than enough\n5- Bonus: a decent mp3 player and a 3.5 headphone jack, but those aren&#x27;t required at all.\n6- Same as above for a reading front light: welcome but not required.<p>I plan to wait at least a couple months, possibly more, in the hope the PineNote development makes it ready for general use, but just in case, any recommendations?
