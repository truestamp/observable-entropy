      "text": "There are tons of posts on HackerNews regarding the issue of &quot;burnout&quot; such as this one https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27630468<p>I&#x27;m curious if people think there&#x27;s some new level of tech burnout going around, due to working from home for the past 2 years?  I, myself, have been on complete autopilot for 2 years, barely doing anything.  Luckily, it&#x27;s barely noticed, as most other co-workers did even less.  I haven&#x27;t been able to look at a computer screen in months without losing focus in 5 minutes or so.  I&#x27;ve experienced burnout in the past, this post-covid burnout feels different.  Society feels like it&#x27;s changed for the worse.  A lack of social interaction is at an all-time low, while social media fighting is at an all-time high.  It&#x27;s exhausting.  I&#x27;m not sure how to solve this problem.  I don&#x27;t give a fuck about the latest web dev tools.  I&#x27;ve been doing this for nearly 13 years and it&#x27;s the same old thing.  I look at Rust, Go, C++ to try and shake things up, and it&#x27;s just a new field of mines.  What should one do?",
