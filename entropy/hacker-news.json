Why give the man who’s happy a “please stay” raise? He’s happy! Why give him a promotion? We need somebody who’s not so friendly with people and is looked at as a leader not a peer. I also find it’s hard to be seen as a leader amongst peers if you’re friendly with them.<p>How does one balance these two extremes? I want to be friendly and kind but I also want people to take me seriously.",
