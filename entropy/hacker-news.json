      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I am considering to buy a stationary Mac. I mostly do web and mobile development. Also, occasional ML.(once in 2 months).<p>Current: MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019), 2,6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7, 16GB<p>Issues:  Too much heat, almost impossible to connect an external monitor, Hangs a lot of time (Maybe Monterey as a whole :) ). (I have lot of tabs on Chrome and Firfox open :) ) \nDo not like the Keyboard.<p>I do zero gaming. I am not particular with portability. So was thinking between Mac mini, iMac and Mac studio. The reason for Mac studio being not needing to invest again in couple of years like my situation now. \nOr is the current line of Mac Book pros better and should I go with them?",
