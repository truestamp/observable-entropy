      "text": "Why has the scientific process and communication of the results of that data been completely destroyed with Covid and turned political?  If you do not state unequivocally that the vaccines are our savior you are labelled an anti-vaxxer and banned from even technical sites like Arstechnica.<p>Mentioning testimony from the 8hr FDA conference call on Sep 17 questions why we don&#x27;t actually have data proving the vaccine is safe for those under 65?  (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;WFph7-6t34M?t=15576).  Providing this info labels you an anti-vaxxer and banished even when it comes directly from the FDA advisors.<p>Why does the US require people that are already immune to get a vaccine even though studies prove you are as good or better protected than those that got the vaccine? See British Medical Journal: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bmj.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;374&#x2F;bmj.n2101.  Even though this is basic immunology knowledge this also gets you labelled as an anti-vaxxer.<p>Why do people always try to prove the covid vaccines are beneficial by saying your anti-body levels are higher after getting a covid vaccine or booster when this is NOT how you actually measure long term resistance?  Anyone with basic human immunology knowledge knows that anti-bodies always drop over time.  They are produced when they are needed to fight off an invader when they are detected.  If anti-bodies never dropped from all the invaders we are exposed to all the time our blood would be as thick as molasses.<p>I fear for our future now that it is common to simply banish anyone who doesn&#x27;t go along with the status quo.",
