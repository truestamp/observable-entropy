      "text": "Hello, fellow HNers.<p>We&#x27;ve been happy Auth0 customers since 2016. When we created the account and started to pay, it was clear on the pricing page that we can stay on the Developer plan for up to 50 000 active users.<p>They recently got acquired by Okta and changed their pricing, so that you need to buy the Enterprise plan, which is around $8000 &#x2F; month &#x2F; 50k MAU. It adds a lot of features we don&#x27;t need. We could stay on the Developer plan, which suits our needs. If we could keep previous pricing it would be $1138 &#x2F; mo &#x2F; 50k MAU (it can be seen in Web Archive [0]).<p>For still an early-stage startup like ourselves, it makes no business sense to start paying almost $100k per year for authentication solution alone.<p>Our options include:\n1. Migrating away from Auth0\n2. Rolling out an in-house solution\n3. Somehow force Auth0 to respect the previous deal<p>I&#x27;d love to get your opinion if there is anything we can do regarding option 3. Unfortunately, for now, Auth0 is not willing to move and only offers us the Enterprise plan.<p>[0] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201031042348if_&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth0.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;",
