      "text": "One of the persistent complaints in my computer use, is the number of various logins one has to do, in order to access various resources. For example for me just to start my day I have to:\n1. Login to my laptop\n2. Login to vpn\n3. Login to corporate SSO for a website resource #1\n4. Login to SSO for a website resource #2<p>Then, let&#x27;s say we step away from the laptop for 15+ minutes, the whole dance has to be repeated. We can argue whether the above is representative or not but, from personal experience seems pretty close to previous.<p>Now, at a minimum we have to login (L) 1 time per day and if we work 8 hours (h) (no breaks, sorry) we get 4L&#x2F;8h = 0.5 L&#x2F;h.<p>This is not really true, as if it were it wouldn&#x27;t be a complaint, so what&#x27;s more likely is that there are 4+ times per day that the above is executed, which gives 2 L&#x2F;h or once every 30 minutes we are asked to type in our password. Here are some examples for which one may step away from their computer: breakfast, lunch, dinner, bathroom, offsite appt., power or internet issues, ...<p>The above is an example of just 1 resource, there are other things that make password managers exist and be a must.<p>Why cannot we have 1 login per day (LPD) or even less, instead of what we have now?",
