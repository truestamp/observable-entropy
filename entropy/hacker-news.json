      "text": "In 2019 I&#x27;ve started developing a project for my wife after consistently hearing her complain about the current software they had.<p>It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but it was made specifically to solve the main pain points she had.<p>Fast forward, she convinced herself that the product is way too good and we should try selling it to other business. So, she made a couple of videos demoing it and spent 20$ on ads in Instagram. We got a couple of interested people, but no one actually asked for using it.<p>Last week we got an email from a company that was interested in trying in. Then we created an account for them and shortly explained how to use it.\nThey&#x27;ve got really impressed by and now want to use it.<p>For now, I&#x27;ve said that they can have a free trial for a month. But they already signaled that they&#x27;re interested in paying the price I&#x27;ve proposed.<p>So, what&#x27;s next? Should I go after bootstraping a company? What about taxes? GDPR? SLA? Should I go after a lawyer and accountant?\nMy current recurring cost for maintaining the system is ~10$ and I&#x27;m expecting to start receiving ~$200 per customer.<p>This should be just a side gig, but I think it might actually grow.<p>In addition, I&#x27;m currently living in Italy, but this client (and probably others comming) lives in Brazil.",
