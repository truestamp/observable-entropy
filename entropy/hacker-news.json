      "text": "This might be the case for more people here, and it&#x27;s a bit of a catch 22. Gmail stopped receiving email on the free gsuite version (legacy, 1 user). If I don&#x27;t pay up, I get no support, and have a broken email.<p>&quot;You are using legacy free edition of Google Apps which doesn&#x27;t have access to support. To access support, you need to upgrade to G Suite.&quot;<p>Would you recommend waiting a bit to see if the problem goes away by itself? Or migrating away from google for once? I have been screwed up by google in the 10k range and would rather not have to do any more business with them, TBH.<p>Anyone not receiving email? It might be an outage.",
