      "text": "Rust is a popular, exciting, modern programming language, but I&#x27;ve had trouble finding Rust events, meetups, and user groups in my area (San Francisco). There have been essentially zero Rust events on Meetup in the last six months. None of the groups that were active when I looked two years ago have any activity.<p>Where does the Rust community gather and hang out IRL to collaborate, discuss projects, and exchange ideas? Where are upcoming Rust conferences announced? Is anyone organizing lightning talks or meet-and-greets anymore?",

      "text": "I often hear developers that want more and better user stories, but are they really that great?<p>I see developers lose connection with the users, iteration momentum, urge to push feature etc. They get more focused on solving tasks than solving business need.<p>On the other side the users loose the feeling of impact and ownership of the change. After a while they don’t want to participate in another user study.<p>I came from a place where we released small features in days, got user freed back and changes again. Using data to guide every decision.<p>When looking back the “data” way gave way more business value, but the “user story” way was easier for management to see as tangible work.<p>Are we doing user stories the wrong way?",
