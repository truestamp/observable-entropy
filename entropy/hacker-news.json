Once the payment is done a Webhook response comes to one of my backend endpoint with the payment state(success&#x2F;failure) &amp; other order details.<p>The application is working fine if it is running locally or with only single instance. But since we have our own Auto scaling group and load balancer configured over DNS, the connection is not getting established all the time.<p>So, how exactly shall this be architectured so as to scale the same horizontally? I don&#x27;t have any DB configured as of now. I have thought of using SNS with SQS but it seems they are way too many overheads. How do big companies like WhatsApp scale?",
