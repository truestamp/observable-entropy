      "text": "I came up with a ridiculous method myself. It works, but I wonder if other people came up with other things.<p>What I can&#x27;t do:<p>* Earplugs<p>If I do that then the earplugs will get into my ear whenever I sleep on my side. This aggravates the tinnitus sound.<p>What I can do:<p>* Earplugs + Airpods Max with ANC off<p>The earplugs will not get into my ear because the shelf surrounding my ear from the Airpods Max protect it. ANC needs to be off because when I side sleep, the microphone that is meant for ANC goes in some feedback loop and then I hear all kinds of beeps. If I lay on my back I can put ANC on.<p>That&#x27;s my method, I&#x27;m looking to improve it to either block more sound. I&#x27;d also be happy with to block as much sound as I do now while lying more comfortable. Having an Airpods Max on is slightly less comfortable than without.<p>With that said, I&#x27;d argue that this method is also really helpful for people without tinnitus since it blocks more sound than just earplugs alone. The passive noise cancellation from having a shelf around your ear from a headphone blocks a lot of low frequency sounds it seems.<p>In any case, how do you do it?",
