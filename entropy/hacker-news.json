It seems like there should be a forum (or even a Better Business Bureau type thing) for the discussion of individual websites, and maybe a browser extension to enable interaction with the &quot;forum page&quot; when you go to the website. I guess this is related to web annotation and curation which I guess are areas of stalled progress. Anyway, does something like this exist?",
