      "text": "I am currently struggling with this issue where I am not able to estimate efforts properly for stories and they get moved out of the sprint because I could not finish them on time.<p>There are multiple reasons for that.<p>1. I work on a legacy codebase and our lead told us to refactor along with normal task. It means every story has some wider scope that it looks from the title and description.<p>2. I am a wanna be perfectionist and try to refactor the older code and make it &quot;beautiful&quot; even when I am not told to do it, so I end up with a wider scope than the story was initially planned<p>3. Sometimes when I am in the &quot;zone&quot; and I find the work interesting I do finish task very quickly but when I am not in the &quot;zone&quot; I struggle to even write basic unit tests. This has given me a false sense of &quot;quickness&quot; in my mind and I end up overcommitting. How do I overcome this?<p>I would like some advice from the experienced devs out there. Please help.",
