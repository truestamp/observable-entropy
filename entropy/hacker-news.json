      "text": "This may be kind of an odd question, but here I go anyway:<p>Do you know of freelance dev work where I can communicate only through text like email&#x2F;slack or similar?\nI really cannot talk over phone&#x2F;zoom or in person. I absolutely cannot react to questions in an adequate way instantaneously, I just get complete blackouts and everything vanishes. It seems to be some mix of imposter syndrome and general anxiety. I am already getting professional help for it. \nI am no rockstar developer but I think I have a some decent skills. I know python, databases, micro services, docker, am starting to get experience in AWS and also have a some front-end experience. \nI built systems that are in use for more than five years reliably and have always been given projects from family members when I was in university. \nRight after university, I started to work for a startup but quit after a few months because it always felt like I had to play a role and I was anxious every day. \nI know this is a hard problem, because software development depends a lot on communicating effectively but maybe someone has had similar struggles.<p>So, my question is: does anyone have ideas how to circumvent this problem? Maybe someone wants to cooperate and act as project-manager? Maybe someone knows where I can find work that does not require calls?",
