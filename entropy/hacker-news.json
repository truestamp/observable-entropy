      "text": "Many years ago, I heard a Tim Ferris podcast with Robert Rodriguez is an avid journaler and used a bunch of Word documents to organize his daily notes. Ever since then, I couldn&#x27;t get my mind off of a personal journaling system primarily organized by day; with a secondary topical organization by Label. After a few false starts of my own and wasting about $10K on an off-shore development company, I was still left with nothing. Recently, I decided to give it one more push and developed the first draft of my dream journaling tool.\nI&#x27;m a developer, I want to also be a writer. Development comes much easier to me than writing.<p>This is an Angular app deployed into Firebase. This was my first time using Firebase. I never published an app in public before because I don&#x27;t feel like I know enough about security. Firebase took all of the thinking out of it (I hope).<p>If interested, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journal-ease.com. I only have Google login because I need it to properly secure the app and FireStore. Also, I promise to send only the occasional development status emails for the foreseeable future.<p>Still ugly and have a long ways to go, but I wanted to share this to see what people think.
