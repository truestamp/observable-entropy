As it happens, my grandfather, Thomas Zielinski, owned the Scottish Cafe (Brettschneider was the manager). I recently wrote a couple of papers that answer many of the questions raised in the discussion - the full text of the English &quot;Mathematicians at the Scottish Cafe&quot; is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;335742570_Mathematicians_at_the_Scottish_Cafe). I am currently embarking on a play loosely around this topic.",
