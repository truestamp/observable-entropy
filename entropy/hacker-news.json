I want to hear interesting or unusual things you use a VM for.<p>For example, I have thought of running a VM only to use git in there, maybe so try and see if magit will run faster in a VM rather than on the host macos. I also have thought of using a VM to only run a browser in there, to keep the memory under control. Not sure any of these are good, but they are interesting.<p>What are your ideas or actual ways you use VMs?",
