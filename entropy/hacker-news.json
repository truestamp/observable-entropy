      "text": "The motivations:<p>- I don’t like journalism bias, each media would often report events from their own interest &amp; profit.<p>- Giant news media monopolies would easily control how an event is being reported, I would like to hear the voices from smaller&#x2F;independent journalistic platforms.<p>- I would like to read the latest news about certain events and to read things that I am concerned about, not just the news that a news media thinks is important.<p>The idea &amp; experiment:<p>- I’m trying to mitigate this by creating a news aggregator that allows the user to select the news sources they would like to read. I expect that news reports from different sources would have different perspectives, therefore intriguing the readers to critically think behind these cross-references and approach the truth behind just texts.<p>- The ability to create optional keyword filters (AND+OR+NOT) to narrow down the topics to read what matters to the users.<p>My website is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reader1984.com<p>It is still pretty barebone at the moment and I am still planning the roadmap for this idea. I’d just like to get more feedbacks not only on the website itself but also on my overall idea and its effectiveness in tackling these problems mentioned above.<p>Thanks for your time reading this, I really appreciate it.",
