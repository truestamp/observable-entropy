      "text": "Hi HNs,\nI&#x27;ve been developing software under contract for a while now, and probably have signed dozens of different contracts and put forth a few of my own also.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of a good open-source popular balanced 1099 software developers contract. Do you know of any?<p>When you buy a house (at least around Seattle), \nit&#x27;s prevalent to use a contract created by the NWMLS (the Northwest Multiple Listing Service). This contract is pretty balanced, and doesn&#x27;t obviously favor the buyer nor the seller (IMO).<p>Why don&#x27;t we have something similar for ourselves, something that addresses both developer&#x27;s and client&#x27;s concerns in a way that attempts to be balanced like many MLS contracts do?<p>Are there other developers or clients, or lawyers in tech who think this would be valuable or interesting?<p>Please let me know if this is interesting to you.\nMy email is in my HN profile. \nCameron&#x2F;Seattle",
