      "text": "I bought an M1 MacBook Air last November and it has been just okay. It&#x27;s a super fast machine, but occasionally I experience mouse lag &#x2F; graphics tearing. The Apple store techs diagnosed this as a trackpad issue (and have replaced it twice). But, I think it&#x27;s a memory issue, as it only happens when my device is swapping a lot of memory; it goes away when I turn swapping off.<p>Has anyone else experienced issues like this?",
