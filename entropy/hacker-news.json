      "text": "Tell me, if this idea is (1) useful, (2) possible or (3) already exists: A local command line tool that runs standard Unix CLI on a fully configured remote server but on local files.<p>So say the local machine only has a process called &#x27;remo&#x27; that talks to a &#x27;remo-server&#x27; process on a remote machine fully configured with git, gradle, python, java, etc. Then I could do something like this locally:<p><pre><code>    &gt; remo git -clone https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;MyProject\n\n    &gt; cd MyProject\n\n    &gt; remo gradle build\n</code></pre>\nSo with &#x27;remo&#x27; I would be able to run all manner of CLI apps that read&#x2F;write to the local file system without installing anything local. The two processes would be reasonably simple:<p>The local &#x27;remo&#x27; CLI app does this:<p>- Open socket to &#x27;remo-server&#x27; process on remote machine<p>- Execute remote CLI apps<p>- Vend file system info to &#x27;remo-server&#x27; (LIST, HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE)<p>The remote &#x27;remo-server&#x27; process does this:<p>- Mount a virtual file system<p>- Execute processes locally in vfs root dir<p>- Feed virtual file system via communication with &#x27;remo&#x27; process<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a great business opportunity, but it seems like it could be pretty useful. What do you think?<p>jeff",
