      "text": "Since my new cycle of anxiety and depression over the last few months i started going to therapy again. Every therapist i&#x27;ve gone thus far said i theorize and overthink a lot, and something that&#x27;s missing from my life is practicality. «Don&#x27;t think, act. Don&#x27;t theorize about a plan. Just start.».<p>And so i&#x27;ve started thinking...<p>I study CS, i want to work in security, i really like and want to learn algorithmic thinking and problem solving, researching, and imagine, but at the same time my mind&#x27;s thought spiral can disable me. (I use the phrase &quot;thought spiral&quot; because i feel it&#x27;s the best description, but i don&#x27;t believe i have, and never been diagnosed with OCD.)<p>How do i balance my desire for a way of life that, at the same time, creates my problems?",
