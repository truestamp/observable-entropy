      "text": "The CN evil spirit controlled the scepter, learned the technology of today&#x27;s human beings and improved it with evil spirit technology.\nThe artificial intelligence related to human recognition is most likely to involve ghouls: ghouls capture human souls and domesticate them into AI, the process is more terrifying than domesticating livestock slaves... Only people with special abilities can observe.<p>Sign 1. When you enter a certain country, even if you turn off all electronic devices, you will still be tracked by extremely high spy technology. In fact, evil spirits domesticate a human soul into spy devices, most of which are children&#x27;s souls...\nSign 2. A ghoul&#x27;s AI can tell from afar if you&#x27;re sleeping or just waking up...<p>The spy equipment domesticated by ghouls is actually a large number of human experiments<p>It is necessary to prohibit the use of artificial intelligence technology that is not fully disclosed, and the AI that recognizes humans...",
