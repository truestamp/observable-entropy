It generally cannot be a landing page for an app and such.<p>If you know a cool little known website, this is the place to add it ! Autopromotion is welcomed.<p>The submission are queued and 10 websites of the queue are released each day. I think this is good for the UX.<p>The concept is old and very simple. It is just a ProductHunt for websites, but I think people will be interested, ( I am and was before building it ).",
