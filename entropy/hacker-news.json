This makes the process quite cumbersome for potential new employees.\nWhy isn&#x27;t there a standardized format for CV&#x27;s? This could be anything from XML, JSON, YAML, CSV or some other text based format. This way the applicants don&#x27;t have to fill in a news form every time and HR can just import the file into their system.<p>I&#x27;ve searched around a bit but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any solution similar to this.",
