The kinds of cookies I&#x27;m willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, `X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary` or `X-Prefer-Cookies: all`.<p>2. The fact that I don&#x27;t, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I&#x27;ll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: `X-Offer-Newsletter: no`, or `X-Offer-Newsletter: yes`.<p>If you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like `X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters`.<p>This way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those cookies, of course).<p>I think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)",
