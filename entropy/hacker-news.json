      "text": "Link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haberdashervcs.com<p>I&#x27;m seeking open-minded and slightly patient alpha testers for Haberdasher: a version control system for huge repos. It combines a git-like workflow with a large-scale database (HBase). Millions of folders, millions of commits, and files up to 1GB.<p>What started as a lockdown project to stay sane has blossomed into a crude prototype. Obviously from the website it&#x27;s only got bare functionality, but I wanted to start showing it around and get some thoughts. If you&#x27;d like to kick the tires, a very short sign-up form is on the website.<p>For the curious: history is stored in HBase, and large files are shunted to HDFS. Both the server and client are in Java, and for more info:<p>- The workflow is documented at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haberdashervcs.com&#x2F;docs<p>- You can browse the source at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.haberdashervcs.com&#x2F;browseHd -- it&#x27;s currently under a source-available license<p>Who am I? I&#x27;m Yash, and I&#x27;m an engineer in the southern US who&#x27;s shuffled between big companies and indie projects for years. You can email me at: yash@haberdashervcs.com. Thanks for reading.",
