I&#x27;ve posted my concept mockup at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parcelplot.us<p>From what it seems, Pacaso isn&#x27;t claiming to actually buy or sell property on behalf of anyone, they&#x27;re setting up an LLC for fractional real estate investment, and:<p>&gt; choosing and managing the property management company; maintaining the LLC and resolving any disputes between owners or the municipality; continually innovating and improving the Pacaso app<p>But it does seem like it&#x27;s a gray area. Obviously I&#x27;ll need to consult an attorney but I wanted to get a better idea of the situation first.",
