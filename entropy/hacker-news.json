      "text": "For quite some time, at least decade and half (in Poland), retail franchises (e.g. Żabka, the biggest one, like 7&#x2F;11) have been a matter of controversy. The press reported unilateral, unfair practices of the franchisors that tie up franchisees, such as buying mandatory equipment, loans, fees, treatment of unsold inventory. Many franchisees who didn&#x27;t succeed end up in huge debt despite working their ass off 12+ hrs a day.<p>Essentially, people become business owners only on paper, in practice they&#x27;re worse off than employees who can more or less walk away. A franchise is all of the downside risk without much upside potential except at top-performing locations.<p>Considering the above - why do people still sign up for them?",
