      "text": "I’m seeing conflicting advise from HVAC professional on this age-old question. I understand that there will be temperature difference between the floors of a house because of thermodynamics, the obvious rule of warmer air rising to the top.<p>Given a two-story home with a a dual-zone furnace HVAC:\nFor winter setting, one camp says to set the second floor thermostat to two degrees warmer.[1] The other camp of advise says the other way, to set the second floor two degrees cooler.[2] \nLet’s assume the two-degree variable  is the ideal difference , the contradiction here is which floor should be set warmer.<p>I believe the second floor should be set warmer because intuitively this seems to be the natural equilibrium. Otherwise one zone will be working harder than the other.<p>[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncwakehvac.com&#x2F;optimal-temperature-settings-multiple-hvac-home&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bardi.com&#x2F;how-to-effectively-set-your-thermostat-for-a-multi-story-home&#x2F;",
