      "text": "I need to perform certain sensitive operations on my computer (access important bank account, sensitive passwords, etc).\nI currently have 1 mac, and my approach is to not install any closed source software.<p>This approach is very limiting though, as there are many closed-source software that would greatly improve my productivity, and some are straight necessary for some of my business activities.<p>So I am currently considering purchasing another mac and performing only sensitive operations on one (with only open source or highly trusted programs), and other tasks on the other (with a lower level of trust in installed programs).<p>However the downside is that managing two computers probably adds a significant complexity. \nIs there a better way to achieve this?
