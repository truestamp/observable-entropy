At the time of writing this, I&#x27;m a student at Camas High School.<p>In July 2021, Million.js began as an experiment with Virtual DOM because I was curious with how UI libraries worked. I was frustrated with the lack of a modern, fast, and modular Virtual DOM library for JavaScript. Virtual DOM had been around for almost a decade, yet many Virtual DOM libraries still struggle with render speed compared to newer methods of rendering.<p>Today, Million.js is the first effort to bring Virtual DOM into the future after hundreds of hours of experimenting. Traditional Virtual DOM libraries have yet to leverage new technological paradigms in the new age of compiled Transitional UI Libraries. Million.js leverages the compiler to create predefined paths, instead of executing all the work in the browser.<p>Hope this serves as an interesting example of how older technologies (relative to JavaScript time) can evolve to modern time (similar to how Solid took Knockout&#x27;s fine-grained strategy and applied modern techniques)",
