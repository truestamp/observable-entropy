      "text": "Hi everyone,I hope this is an ok place to rant because I&#x27;m so tired - mentally and physically.<p>I found a job in the marketing area and it is draining. Not the job as much as the people I work with. I&#x27;m very new to the field, but asking questions is bad. I&#x27;m good at my job (the results show) but the people around me are rude, hostile, and downright condescending when I ask questions. Even HR is rude, so there&#x27;s really no one to talk to. The turnover rate is high as well. It&#x27;s exhausting to deal with this day in day out and feel anxious and dreaded to go into work. That said, I can&#x27;t quit for now - I need the money and I&#x27;m not hearing back from anyone else. Are there people out there who can go into work and just go home without having to deal with all this BS? I&#x27;m also seeing a therapist because my self-esteem is at an all-time-low. It&#x27;s slow but for now I just feel like running away from all of this.<p>PS I know it&#x27;s pointless to rant but I just feel so stuck and hopeless.",

      "text": "I&#x27;m a software engineer, mainly working on mobile apps (iOS primarily) through React Native and some Swift&#x2F;Java. I have a CS degree and about 7 years in this field.<p>However recently I&#x27;ve become very aware that JS&#x2F;TS and Swift etc are just APIs on top of APIs. I&#x27;ve been drawn to learning more about how computers work, the history of programming&#x2F;computers (Unix, Sinclair, commodore, etc and even going back to Ada Lovelace, Babbage and mainframes in the 1950s) and things like memory allocation. I&#x27;ve tried learning some BASIC and Assembly code but haven&#x27;t really got very far. I read&#x2F;devour articles on sites like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twobithistory.org but they only get you so far.<p>What can I do to help accelerate this and satiate this desire to learn more about how computers work? I live in London, UK and would be happy to spend some money on a uni course or something if there was a good one. I learn best practically so like to be &quot;doing&quot; something as well as theory.",

      "text": "I work a 40 hour week, usually from 10 to 6.<p>It&#x27;s so happened, that most of businesses surrounding me are also only open during exactly same time.<p>I am a human, and I need to go to doctors, therapists, other time I need to visit some place to let&#x27;s say choose some furniture to buy, or just to drink a cup of coffee in a lunch time on a terrace of a cafe. I am human, and I feel I am becoming less human if I don&#x27;t allow myself such things!<p>The problem is that I don&#x27;t understand how to talk about that with my employer. Usually when I need to get out, I just put the &quot;afk&quot; status on slack and go.<p>What happens after: if I had no slack mentions, and nothing happened, I feel okay, as if my &quot;bad move&quot; went unnoticed. But if I see some unviewed mentions, somebody was pinging me, I immediately feel lots of shame and guilt. My reaction is: &quot;I&#x27;m here now, let&#x27;s work work work! I am sorry I was absent people!&quot; It feels really bad and weird.<p>HN, did you also ever feel like this? What strategies you found useful?",
