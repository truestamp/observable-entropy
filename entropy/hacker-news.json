Can this be changed?<p>Say, I want to see all stories from New Yorker, ranked based on votes those stories received, what do I do?<p>I know this part-<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=newyorker.com\n</code></pre>\nBut what more do I add to rank the result based on number of votes?<p>Or is there a completely different way to do this?",
