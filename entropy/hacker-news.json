It was a 4-car pileup and my car was destroyed.<p>The driver said she was using Autopilot, that an OTA update had had a problem earlier in the day, and that she had actually had the same kind of collision on Autopilot previously!<p>I talked with the NTSB who said that they won&#x27;t investigate because no one was killed.<p>I talked with the NHTSA who said that they can&#x27;t take a complaint: only the driver can file a complaint and they will only investigate if they &quot;see a trend&quot;.<p>This seems like a serious issue that someone should be looking at. Does anyone have any idea about how to get this actually investigated to see if it was another Autopilot failure?",
