Then you were like, hello, verbatim by default, yo. Then you were like hey, don&#x27;t track me, bruh. Then, what&#x27;s up with all these ads, bruh? Then you complained about poor search results. Then reviews become very, very important. Who can you trust? Then you wanted an SEO proofed web search engine. What&#x27;s canon? Then you realized you wanted to be able to exclude certain domains from your results, because you know who to trust. Also, it must be FOSS!<p>Is there anything else that I&#x27;ve missed? Me and probably also all of my fellow web search engine builders out there who do this backed with money or as a side show would sure like to know.<p>If we can decide in scope, please, that&#x27;d be great. Then you&#x27;ll start to see super focused contenders popping up on Show HN in no time that mean business. Let&#x27;s stop complaining and let&#x27;s do something about search!<p>Scope freeze after this meeting.",
