      "text": "I have an upcoming third and last interview with a well-established German company for the Frontend position.<p>I will be joined by the Tech Lead and the Tech manager of the company discussing my future role, current projects in their pipeline, as well as how I will get along with them.<p>I haven&#x27;t gone through any technical assessment from their end yet. And the HR told me there won&#x27;t be any technical assessment rather they would assess me based on questions and answers.<p>This is a kind of new experience for me because in the past I always had some sort of frontend challenge to solve before they proceeded with my application.<p>I guess the Tech lead would ask technical questions and I want to be as well prepared for that as possible.<p>Is this common for a German company to have such a short recruiting process? Anyone else went through a similar experience? Any suggestions on what should I look forward to in the upcoming interview.<p>Thanks",
