      "text": "As someone who owns a bit of Facebook stock (please don&#x27;t shoot me!) I am interested in the company&#x27;s future prospects.\nAs we all know Facebook&#x27;s main income comes from advertisers, and much of the information Facebook gathers on users comes from the infamous &quot;Facebook Pixel&quot; - a tiny iframe that websites around the internet plant that reports to Facebook (along with our data) whenever the page loads.\nThis has worked wonderfully (for Facebook) until Apple recently started blocking 3rd party cookies on iphones.\nGoogle has announced plans of doing the same on Chrome yet so far it&#x27;s been delayed.\nThis has caused a serious drop in Facebook&#x27;s share.<p>Yet I ask - how hard is it for Facebook to gain this data (or similar?). They already have a Conversion API - basically it&#x27;s like a Facebook Pixel for the backend. So every shop&#x2F;website who wants to use Facebook ads simply integrates this onto their backend (Afaik there are ready made integrations for Shopify shops etc). Any serious advertiser probably has someone technical enough to throw a few lines of code onto their server.<p>So in short - my theory is everything will be reported from the backend. The people who can&#x27;t make the integration are probably not big ad spenders anyway.<p>What&#x27;s your take?",
