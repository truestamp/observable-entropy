      "text": " Hey hackers,<p>Really excited to share Sportbookr with you (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sportbookr.app). Here&#x27;s the story behind how it all went down:<p>Backstory:\nI played for the Canadian Cricket team in 2019 (yes that&#x27;s a real thing lol), and the owner at my local sports facility was complaining every day about how much time he spent answering messages, emails, and texts for bookings.<p>After digging into it, I realized two things:<p>1) The existing tools (eSoft Planner, eZ Facility, etc) are all super old and clunky. They all look like they were built in the 90s (and some of them actually were!). They require multiple days of training for the facility staff, and are horrendously annoying to book for the facility&#x27;s customers (player, parent, or athlete).<p>2) This problem plagues all kinds of sports facilities - not just cricket. Baseball cages, tennis clubs, squash courts, etc. all have this degree to some extent.<p>So we decided to build something better<p>Sportbookr is the exact opposite of the tools I described above. With an all-star team from leading tech companies like Shopify, we&#x27;ve built something beautiful.<p>Now, facility owners can get online booking, scheduling, and payments all setup in minutes - without any training. Their customers too will benefit - with an effortless 1-click booking experience.<p>Let me know what you think!",
