What happened to creating, crafting, and inventing?  Do\nthe words we use to describe ourselves affect mental health,\nproductivity, and the quality of what we make?<p>Property &quot;developers&quot;, at least in British parlance, are greedy\nopportunists who ruin a nice view, and would never get their hands\ndirty with a cement mixer or paintbrush. &quot;Personal development&quot; has\nreplaced education and living. &quot;Developments in the war&quot; stand in for\natrocities, routs and victories. I feel I am &quot;developing&quot; a headache\njust contemplating the banality of weak euphemisms.<p>As we throw together &quot;frameworks in the cloud&quot; and &quot;deploy solutions\nat scale&quot;, is an amorphous word like &quot;developer&quot; a way of excusing\nourselves from understanding, and distancing ourselves from the\nconsequences of digital activity?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thisishcd.com&#x2F;episode&#x2F;hannah-smith-the-hidden-weight-of-code",
