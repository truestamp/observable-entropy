      "text": "This morning there was an excellent article from The Atlantic about China&#x27;s Uyghur treatment through the eyes of a family that escaped to the United States. However, now due to downvoting, flagging, or other hiding, it&#x27;s no longer on the front page or the next three pages. It had been a front page article. How can I find this submission that is no longer showing up? NOTE: I am not looking for the article (which is called One By One, My Friends Were Sent to the Camps). I am looking for the submission and comment section.",
