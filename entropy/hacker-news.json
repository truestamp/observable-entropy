      "text": "Hi everyone  let me tell you a story, Back 1 year ago I made a blurweb.app as a way to hide sensitive information while I screen share while making youtube videos<p>Blurweb app worked well but because it is a browser extension it was limited to hiding stuff on the web, after multiple requests I finally decided to launch a desktop app with the same purpose.<p>The result is blurscreen.app which helps you hide sensitive info on the screen with a single click.<p>The plan is to improve the app making it better to solve the issue of hiding sensitive info while screen sharing.<p>I will really appreciate it if you check out the demo video I made on the homepage and let me know if you find it helpful in the comments",
