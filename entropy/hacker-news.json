      "text": "Hi HN, we&#x27;re Jacobo, Sergio &amp; Pablo, founders of Arengu (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arengu.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arengu.com</a>). We let you build cutting-edge signup flows as Airbnb, Stripe, or Slack for your SaaS, without dedicating a full engineering team.<p>Building an application requires coding boring flows like signup, logins, payments, and waiting lists. As applications grow, more complex flows are required, and most of the time they can only be edited by engineering teams. If something breaks, sometimes it takes time to notice. Measuring where users drop off can be tricky. Growth and marketing teams want autonomy to sign up users in landing pages, test new flows and get insights into what performs better.<p>At our previous jobs, we were constantly asked by clients to customize the signup, adding logic or integrations. We didn&#x27;t find a good solution to cover the UI and custom logic with APIs other than coding from scratch. So we built a low-code platform, suitable for non-engineering teams, where you can build all the UI and integrations with a visual interface. Then you embed the flow in your site where you want it to appear with just a line of code.<p>Key features include: email or phone verification with OTPs; Stripe integration to enroll users in trial subscriptions; rate limiting to avoid spam or brute force attacks; approvals to build a waiting list and manually approve or reject signups; analytics events to track any user interaction with your flows; native integrations to send data back and forth between us and your apps; custom HTML&#x2F;JS to extend your flows’ capabilities.<p>We make money based on the volume of submissions you have per month or based on product capabilities (eg. adding payment flows in your signup).<p>Watch our product intro video (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Go_Dxbj0Jdo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Go_Dxbj0Jdo</a>) or if you scroll down our homepage (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arengu.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arengu.com</a>) to “Try a sign-up flow demo” you can see what the product looks like to the end-user and play around - it’s not to sign up to Arengu :P. There are more demos for every of the common use cases we have (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arengu.com&#x2F;use-cases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arengu.com&#x2F;use-cases</a>).<p>We would love to get feedback about your experience building signups flows: painful parts (eg. UI, logic, security, etc), complex flows (eg. KYC, OTPs, data verification, etc); anything you would like to share with us, or if you think we can help you, feel free to reach out at jacobo [at] arengu.com :)",
