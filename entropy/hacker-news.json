This works well, but I need a solution for minor editing - e.g. cutting two videos and then stitching them together.<p>I don&#x27;t need anything fancy. I just want to create product demos for software that I work on. (E.g. here is a video I created yesterday: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=N9LoJo8MgnM)<p>Any recommendations?",
