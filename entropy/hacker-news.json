      "text": "I am planning to buy a wasteland measuring 5-10 acres in India without a lot of water. I plan to save water using rainwater harvesting and hoping that I run into some groundwater. This land has no irrigation facility.<p>What would be the most efficient use of something like this ? I am planning to start a small library&#x2F; school for impoverished tribals but I was wondering if there is any way a land like this can be made self sustaining using new technological or other solutions that I may not be aware of.<p>I always ask myself questions like:<p>What is the best way to convert sunlight &amp; water to biomass ?<p>How to utilize solar energy locally ?<p>How much water can I reuse ?<p>The idea is to show that something sustainable can be done with right approach and hopefully support at least 4-5 poor people and more others (via education).",
