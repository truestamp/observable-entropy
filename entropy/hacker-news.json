      "text": "Dear HN,<p>I recently tried to follow along some Huggingface tutorials and - WOW! - was that painful. Google Colab quickly started complaining about the 300 GB my datasets were using. I was also constantly out of memory and reviews said that even if I&#x27;d upgrade to $50 monthly, my chance of randomly being assigned a GPU with enough memory would be slim.<p>I also looked at AWS EC2 and GCE and got sticker shock. I&#x27;m certainly not going to pay $20+ per hour the entire time I try to figure out how stuff works. Then I found OVH and their $2 per hour V100 instances seemed much more reasonable. So I built a docker image to emulate what&#x27;s pre-installed and pre-configured on Google Colab based on their example. [1] That worked OK, but having only 1GBit&#x2F;s between the AI training node and their object storage turned out to be the bottleneck.<p>So I took the next logical step, built a small proxy with authentication and letsencrypt SSL [2] to secure things and then self-hosted the docker image on the Ubuntu PC in my basement. That one only has a consumer-grade Samsung SSD and a 1080 TI but it has zero IO delays. In the end, training a facebook Wav2Vec2 model on that 1080 TI is comparably fast to a V100. And since the machine is in my basement, there are no $$$ per hour rental fees. It&#x27;s effectively free, except for electricity.<p>So now I have my own Google Colab clone which is accessible from anywhere and running in my basement. Compared to public clouds it&#x27;s cheaper, more responsive, I have more control, and it&#x27;s even similarly fast.<p>I feel like I found a cheat code for &quot;the cloud&quot; :)<p>To setup your own copy, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fxtentacle&#x2F;letsencrypt-auth-proxy#example-private-google-colab-clone<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.docker.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;fxtentacle&#x2F;ovh-colab-sagemaker-compatibility-mode\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fxtentacle&#x2F;letsencrypt-auth-proxy",
