      "text": "He all,<p>So I may have have a rather strange question, but I’m not able to find the answer myself, hopefully there is some solar panel knowledge here!<p>My girlfriend and myself are currently planning a trip where we will drive from Europe to South Africa and back with an existing electric car which would take approximately one year. We want to show the world what is possible driving an electric car; even big adventures can be green.<p>We want to install solar panels on the car, but this would not generate enough electricity for continues driving, therefor we will bring roughly 25m2 (~5kW) of solar panels with us to charge the car 4 to 5 hours a day.<p>My question is, what would technically the best way to setup the charge of 25m2 of solar panels?<p>If we use the solar panels to charge a battery which will be converted to 230v to charge the car, we will ruin the battery if we need to do this for a year. Is it possible to charge the car directly with solar panels without a battery in between? If so, which systems would be capable of supporting this?<p>Find us at Instagram: 4x4electric",
