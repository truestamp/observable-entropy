      "text": " With many no-code &#x2F;low-code tools out in market. (Tools like @Appsmith, @Retool, @DronaHQ, @jetadmin @bubble etc ) I am building an evaluation tool which will help user to evaluate the platform and identify the right one for his&#x2F;her needs. I have broken down the parameters according to following categories (And given weightage to each categories &amp; parameter within)\n- Basic\n- Frontend Development\n- Actionflows&#x2F; Event handlers\n- Branding\n- Developer Productivity &amp; Tooling\n- BPM Workflows\n- Automation Capabilities\n- Built-in Database\n- Integration Capabilities\n- Deployment\n- Sharing \n- User Management\n- Security\n- Support + Community \n- App Lifecycle Support\n- Analytics\n- Pricing Flexibility<p>How do you evaluate the platforms&#x2F;tools? Which parameters are of most importance to you? Any thoughts or other evaluation tools that you would like me to refer to?<p>P.S. Once built I will share the tool with the community here.",
