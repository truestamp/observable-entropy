Also other features like Vim-like modal editing, Tree-sitter for syntax highlighting, built-in LSP support and WASI based plugin system.<p>Previous HN discussion: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29549173\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29549173</a>",
