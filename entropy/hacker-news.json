      "text": "The other day I wrote a &quot;get it off my chest&quot; post about YouTube Premium showing me ads [1]. Yesterday when I was laying in bed waiting for the sleep to come, it happened again [2].<p>YouTube was back at showing ads to paying customers. I left a message on their support channel with the screenshot [2] but fearing that they would not respond me and dismiss the case like they did last time [1]\n(they told me that showing me an Ad for an internal product does not count as an Ad), I got in touch with Dang asking if it was OK for me to write another post about it, since the last one got\nflagged.<p>Before I got my answer from him, YouTube have contacted me with a refund and an apology (in portuguese) [3]. This time I&#x27;d like to thank the YouTube team for the fast response and the apology. It&#x27;s not often that Big Tech take the time out to resolve an issue with a costumer in such short time.<p>1 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27946777<p>2 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;KKcPx7o<p>3 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;9y5dxWm<p>If you don&#x27;t speak portuguese and want to know whats in the email, I suggest using a OCR (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victorribeiro.com&#x2F;ocr) to extract the text from the image and then pasting it on a translator.",
