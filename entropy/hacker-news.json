      "text": "Recently I saw a statement of someone claiming to be most productive in Smalltalk, and someone commenting that he&#x2F;she wasn&#x27;t [0]. I have noticed that I find stories as to why people that are or aren&#x27;t productive in a language insightful. I will be in &quot;building projects&quot; mode within 2 weeks from now [2]. I know most of my projects will involve API access, database stuff, simple math computations, if needed. It probably won&#x27;t involve a web front-end, it might but I wouldn&#x27;t count on that.<p>I&#x27;ve seen quite a few languages to one degree or another [1]. So for the following languages I have a clue how productive I&#x27;d be:<p>JS, Py3, Java, Obj-C, C, C++, Bash, Ruby, C#, VBA, x86-64, R, PHP, Matlab, Mathematica, and Go.<p>I&#x27;d still like to know what you think from these languages in which you feel most productive and why.<p>Languages I don&#x27;t have a clue about:<p>Haskell, Lisp, Smalltalk, Kotlin, Swift, Rust, Dart, Scala, Perl, Julia, Groovy, APL, Erlang, Elixir, Clojure, Delphi and F#<p>I&#x27;d really like to know from these languages in which you feel most productive and why.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29225207<p>[1] At least one project, all the way up to using professionally.<p>[2] Personal context:<p>I&#x27;m going to be unemployed soon. Rather than finding a new job I figured, screw it! I&#x27;m going to do stuff that I actually like to do. After 3.16 hellish years that was 23 months job searching in the software industry, and 15 months of working at companies I wasn&#x27;t a fit for (one way or another) I <i>need</i> that. A bsc. and msc. in computer science did not get me far in the resume screening round (hence the long search for almost 2 years).",
