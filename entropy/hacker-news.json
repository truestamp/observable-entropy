      "text": "For my work, I often have to present scientific topics to an audience. This often includes a fair amount of notation in form of LaTeX math that has to go into the presentation slides.<p>So far, I have not found a good solution to efficiently include LaTeX in any presentation software.<p>There are plugins, but they rely on a local LaTeX distribution which, let&#x27;s be honest, is always a pain to manage.<p>These days, I find myself using a browser app to render equations, then download and import the math as SVG or PNG. This somewhat works: The problem is that I have yet to find a web app that supports bot, a wide range of commands (like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;katex.org&#x2F;) or\nthe export to SVG (like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;viereck.ch&#x2F;latex-to-svg&#x2F;).<p>Any suggestions how to optimize my workflow?",
