If not I&#x27;ll be building my own, but I wanted to see if anyone here knew of something that I hadn&#x27;t found yet.<p>In an ideal world it&#x27;d be a repo anyone can clone, swap out some workspace-specific IDs and tokens, deploy to your own Slack workspace, and come with a few basic test commands.",
