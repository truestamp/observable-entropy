      "text": "An urgent problem nowdays is that really few are trustworthy in the current media scene. Alternative (not mainstream) media, youtube&#x2F;rumble&#x2F;odysee etc have some really good content creators, but they all focus on a single language.<p>How can I&#x2F;we make their work accessible for masses (for other languages)? I have no right to translate and post their material, but to make a translation available they have to do extra work each time. I doubt someone like Russel Brand with 5M subscribers is going to even recognize such an attempt in his email&#x2F;comment section and it’s impossible for every translator candidate (who might do a great job but has limited time so can do 30mins of translation&#x2F;month) to deal the with each content creator.<p>Any ideas?",
