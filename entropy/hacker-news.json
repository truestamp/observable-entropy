      "text": "I make a pretty good salary. I can easily spare a few bucks, but I generally don’t give them any money.<p>I was curious if others who work in places with lots of high paying jobs but lots of homeless as well, do or don’t and why or why not.

I feel a little guilty just trying to ignore them as I drive past, but I’m also like should I?",
