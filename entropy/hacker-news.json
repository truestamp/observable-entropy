And how most people are taking all that information without questioning and letting &quot;unknown&quot; formula, that was orchestrated by pharmaceuticals, be injected into their bodies.<p>Given that both my parents were medics (dad was a surgeon), I just don&#x27;t buy it.<p>There are some conspiracy theories floating around online, but even if we disregard a theory that the entire thing may orchestrated, it is common sense to be cautious, given the vaccine is very new and using unconventional mRNA sequencing as opposed to traditional, long-tested vaccines.<p>Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m the only one (among my colleagues, friends, and even family members) that is questioning this.",
