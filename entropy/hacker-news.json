      "text": "For those —like myself— who are upset about Apple&#x27;s recent decision to share perceptual hashes of your phone&#x27;s private content with a third party, what do you intend to do about it? Are people changing phones to opt-out, or installing custom ROMs?<p>It&#x27;s been very heartwarming to see that a large part of the Hacker News community shares many of my concerns regarding what I feel is a very invasive overreach by Apple. For my own part, this has been the incentive to stop procrastinating and finally get myself a phone that can run a custom Android ROM. I know this doesn&#x27;t solve all of the issues of privacy on mobile phones, however it is a move much more consistent with my ethics, given my own dislike of Google&#x27;s business practices.",
