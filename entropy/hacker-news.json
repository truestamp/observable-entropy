      "text": "Hello everyone!<p>I am the developer of a media centric distribution of Wagtail + Django called Rent Free Media.<p>It is basically an open source Patreon or Substack.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rentfree.media is the site and the git is linked there.  The license is AGPL for obvious reasons.<p>It generates RSS feeds from web page content, using the Django RSS feed framework, so that users can publish both their site their podcast episodes (or paid written content, if they are a Substack-type written content author) all in one edit.<p>Summary of features:<p>1. Integration with Stripe for subscription payments.\n2. User permissions are handled via a segmentation library which is also open-source, so custom and complex pay tier rules are easily attainable.\n3. Automatic generation of authenticated RSS links for podcast apps and news readers.\n4. Mass and &quot;drip&quot; email marketing tools.\n5. Remote and locally hosted files are supported for public &#x2F; free content.\n6. If you like Markdown, it will make Chicago-style episode notes in iTunes, Spotify, and Google&#x27;s app for podcasts ;)\n7. Default HTML templates are Bootstrap 5, and custom CSS can be applied to block elements in the CMS without getting into the template code for simple styling of page elements.\n8. Podcasts may be published in both series and serial format, with or without visible previews of paid episodes, with or without combined pay&#x2F;premium feeds. All configurable in the CMS admin without touching the code.\n9. JSON+LD schema data is generated automatically including breadcrumbs, per page.\n10. Dynamic web forms, optionally with conditional form fields based on the user&#x27;s entries.\n11. Auditable &#x2F; actionable download tracking of premium content on a per-user basis.\n12. 2FA out of the box, optional for users and optionally required for admins.\n13. AJAX comments wherever you want to put them, just include the block on a page in the CMS editor (or not).\n14. Full text &#x2F; full site search via the Postgres DB.\n15. A simple cache is included for anonymous requests, supporting all Django cache backends.<p>As the readme on the git states, it will work locally on the Django dev server with the caveat that media files won&#x27;t &quot;play&quot; without Nginx to respond to the X-Sendfile requests, and a minor SQLite complex field filter support oddity which is not breaking in terms of functionality.",
