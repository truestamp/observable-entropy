      "text": "I&#x27;ve been buying stuff from Amazon for years.  A few months ago I finally gave in and signed up for the Amazon credit card.  Big mistake!<p>The card had a $500 limit, which I didn&#x27;t realize or would never have signed up.  I maxed it out the first month.  When I called Chase to get the limit extended, it was a big runaround with non-native-English support reps I couldn&#x27;t understand, plus to get it autopaid from my checking account, I had to sign up for online crap with Chase.  So I canceled it.  2nd big mistake.<p>My insurance agent calls the other day and said my insurance went up more than 8% because my insurance score went from 950-something, a high score he said he rarely sees, to 851, which is high but not unusual.  Trying to figure out what caused the drop, he asked about my credit - had anything changed.  After talking about it, he guessed it was the new credit card that was canceled.  It makes sense because one of the credit risks used in scoring is the balance to credit limit ratio.  With that $500 card I hit the limit.  LexisNexis goes into more detail:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;consumer-solutions.custhelp.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;answers&#x2F;detail&#x2F;a_id&#x2F;2523<p>My insurance is now costing me $400 more a year, and according to that page, it could stay on my credit report for 7 years.  That&#x27;s messed up.<p>Don&#x27;t get an Amazon credit card!",
