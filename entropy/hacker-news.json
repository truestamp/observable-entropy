I&#x27;d like to avoid ever having to kill whatever processes I have running.<p>Something like Google&#x27;s Live Migration would also be a good match here, if it enabled migrating to a bigger machine type without rebooting, or without otherwise losing process state.<p>Ideally I&#x27;m looking for something that I could transparently scale up and down, and which I could always SSH into without having to manually start&#x2F;shutdown the instances.<p>Bonus points if GPUs could be added&#x2F;removed in the same manner.",
