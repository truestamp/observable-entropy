I also see data models all over the place between services, sometimes held inside an excel sheet. Also there&#x27;s no standardized system that people actually use (Like UML but I rarely seen it used.) Maybe I&#x27;m just at the wrong companies and other companies have it all figured out?",

Every backpack out there is like a padded pillowcase offering almost no protection from drops or being crushed in a tight airplane overhead bin.<p>For the last 6 years I’ve used a Griffin Survivor backpack which is incredible and was discontinued by Griffin almost instantly. I have no idea why. It’s the best backpack I’ve ever owned.<p>Here’s one of the last remaining records of it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gearinstitute.com&#x2F;the-survivor-bag-will-keep-your-precious-technology-safe-while-on-the-road&#x2F;<p>Pelican has also discontinued all of their hard shell backpacks. Which were great. Now they just have run of the mill useless ones.<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?",
