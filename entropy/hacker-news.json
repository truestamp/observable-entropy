This (IMHO) shows that I’m helping my fellow co-workers with their needs, have a say about our working conditions and participate in our coordinated discussions with the company, without being involved in internal politics and always outside political parties&#x2F;organizations. I’ve never received a comment or question about this part of my CV, but I’d like to hear how other people see it.",
