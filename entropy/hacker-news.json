      "text": "Brad Spengler (of grsecurity) brags about hoarding linux vulnerability for 5 years: [1] [2]<p>In another quickly deleted tweet from his personal account, he simply wrote:<p>&gt; &lt;spendergrsec&gt; Comment from 2016: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;704336&#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;FAEbDBwWEAQsi58.png<p>Archives at [3] and [4].<p>So what does that mean? In a 2016 mailing list post [5] spender provides a checksum of his &quot;KASLR haha 17&quot; text file, which describes &#x2F; exploits a KASLR vulnerability he was aware of at the time. Today (in 2021) the vulnerability was found by someone else and fixed upstream: [6]<p>The checksum is a way to prove that the file he had back then matches the fix released today, or at least to verify a string of text mentioning the problem, while <i>withholding any actual information about the fix</i>. He has a habit [7] of posting checksums in tweets and later revisiting them while saying &quot;grsecurity had this fix for X months&#x2F;years.&quot; In other words, government agencies and other corporations can get the fix, but everyday users cannot.<p>His whole business model is being bitter and hostile to Linux, while also benefiting from it. His company&#x27;s paid-only patchset contains other security enhancements in addition to *unreported security issues* like this one. By hoarding vulnerabilities to his customers, he is hurting the entire Linux community. It&#x27;s absolutely scummy behavior of the worst degree.<p>Do you know any companies that support this guy by subscribing to grsecurity patches?<p>(Brad is the same guy who tried to get Greg KH removed from the Linux Foundation&#x27;s board of directors after the University of Minnesota fiasco and the same guy who sued someone for saying his patches violate the GPL. He lost and had to pay $250,000.)<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;grsecurity&#x2F;status&#x2F;1441446002137780242\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;xYmvx\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;FAEbDBwWEAQsi58.png\n[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;FB9HeyI.png\n[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;704336&#x2F;\n[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.openwall.net&#x2F;linux-hardening&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;14\n[7] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;2K7uj",
