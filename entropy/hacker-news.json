      "text": "I&#x27;m a single engineer who wants to run a database by myself, no cloud vendors involved. I don&#x27;t really care about scalability to a point, I don&#x27;t really care about the API to interact with the database. I just want something that I can set up on multiple machines with minimal effort and have the loss of one of those nodes not cause catastrophic failures. I want the experience of something like etcd without being limited to a few gigabytes of data in the cluster (a Terabyte or maybe a couple hundred Gigabytes as a limit would probably be fine). I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time looking through the various options and wrote up my thoughts on why each of them wasn&#x27;t a good fit.<p>Postgres: A great database but HA options either have far too many moving parts, require manual intervention, are proprietary, or are Fake Open Source. Seems like there&#x27;s lack of interest in addressing this because companies that sponsor development generate a lot of value off complex operations\nMySQL: This database has some odd behavior but that would be fine if it weren&#x27;t Fake Open Source\nMariaDB: HA Options are poor or abandoned\nSQL Server: Proprietary\nOracle: haha\nCockroachDB: Fake Open Source\nYugabyteDB: Fake Open Source. Special shout out here for not even linking to instructions for how to build the database in the readme.\nMongoDB: Proprietary, and even before the license change it was Fake Open Source\nCassandra: Not fun to run, and even though I said I didn&#x27;t care about API I don&#x27;t necessarily love how it works. But it comes probably the closest?\nScyllaDB: Fake Open Source\nTiDB: Fake Open Source\nSinglestore: Fake Open Source\nFoundationDB: This one comes close but its beginning as a proprietary database really hurt its community, which is way smaller now than it should be. Could grow into something great if more folks got behind it.\netcd: not suitable for use above a couple GB of data<p>What do I mean by Fake Open Source? A project that has a large percentage of its contributors beholden to a single organization&#x2F;entity to me is not really open source in spirit. I&#x27;m looking for a project where I can feel confident my contributions won&#x27;t effectively end up behind some proprietary license down the line if&#x2F;when the VC backed organization that primarily sponsors development decides it needs to protect itself from AWS. If there&#x27;s an &quot;Enterprise&quot; product and the organization calls the source code for the main project the &quot;Community Edition&quot; or something like it, it&#x27;s not Real Open Source. If a single organization shuts down and contributions fall off a cliff (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rethinkdb&#x2F;rethinkdb&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;contributors) it&#x27;s not Real Open Source. There are lots of Real Open Source projects with great communities of users&#x2F;contributors, but many of the newer databases don&#x27;t have legitimate open source development communities behind them, in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;ve probably missed some examples. Mostly, I wonder why there hasn&#x27;t been a general purpose open source database that does the operations stuff as well as the proprietary databases do. Am I missing something?",
