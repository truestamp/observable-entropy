      "text": "I’d kill to ditch my current provider, but the only other provider in my area that offers DOCSIS or fiber broadband appears to be unavailable at my address.<p>I’m curious whether satellite providers are worth looking at. It seems that some of them offer similar “up to” speeds as my current provider, but at a significant cost increase.<p>But I never get close to the “up to” bandwidth my ISP advertises and a cheaper plan with a Lowe “up to” from a different provider could be fine if in effect I get the same speeds (from memory it’s rare to get more then 50-60mbps down”.<p>I’ve also have read about higher latency with satellite connection, and am not sure offhand how much that would effect me.",
