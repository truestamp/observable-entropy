      "text": "I wish to become a professional network engineer (in particular: telecommunications). I’ve been doing intermediate level programming and sysadmin projects since I was a teenager (23 now) but I stil feel like a total noob. I enrolled in university to get my bachelors in “Network Engineering and Cybersecurity” but the field is so extremely vast and complex that I fear this course alone won’t be nearly enough. I am asking for suggestions on how I can learn, from the ground up, how to go from level 1 to a master network engineer. Can you please give me any project ideas, books, links, or advice that will help me? Thankyou for reading.",
