      "text": "My company (based in the UK) has a number of software engineering positions open at the moment.  We were considering using one of the many team augmentation providers who source engineers in Eastern Europe as we&#x27;re finding supply in the UK job market too constricted at the moment.<p>We&#x27;re in a position to sponsor work visas, and would happily take on the additional effort required to do the paperwork and help people settle in the UK who have been displaced from the Ukraine.<p>The problem is that I have no idea how to execute this idea.  It&#x27;s likely this will only be viable for people who have already left the Ukraine for Poland or Hungary, and I don&#x27;t know how to find them or let them know about this opportunity.<p>Maybe the HN community has some ideas that would help.",
