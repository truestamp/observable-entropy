The PoC uses script and JSONPath to evaluate the input structured data to determine criteria for logging:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tersesystems&#x2F;dynamic-debug-logging<p>I have examples of more dynamic logging stuff:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tersesystems&#x2F;echopraxia-examples<p>There&#x27;s a couple of other instance of dynamic logging, but it does not seem to be very well known.

In effect, it means I&#x27;m unable to link up a new GitHub repo to Heroku and might not be able to do any updates either.<p>------------<p>To mitigate impact from potentially compromised OAuth tokens, we will revoke over the next several hours all existing tokens from the Heroku GitHub integration. We are also preventing new OAuth tokens from being created until further notice. Your GitHub repositories will not be affected in any way by this action.<p>Currently running Heroku applications will not be affected, but this will prevent you from deploying your apps from GitHub through the dashboard or via automation. Some other actions in the dashboard will no longer work due to this mitigation, and you will be unable to reconnect to GitHub even though you may see warning banners about reconnecting.\nAs a temporary workaround, you can use one of the other code deployment methods available in the following documentation:",

In that case I acted as a Product Manager and had 1 developer doing the work for me.<p>- I did CS50 from Harvard online and a Python course with MIT both on EDx, but I am not able to apply for a programmer job (which I think I would enjoy and might be a way to eventually turn into a technical PM)<p>I&#x27;m playing around with selenium and chromedriver building a bot that swipes on tinder based on certain parameters,  but I don&#x27;t feel like I could be considered for a programming job.",
