      "text": "Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this idea off and on for a few weeks now and I figured it was time to show it to folks before continuing to build it out any further (hence the terrible UI).<p>The idea is this: A smart contract that allows players to win the tokens in the contract in proportion to the number of tokens they&#x27;ve depositing into the smart contract.  For example, if you and another player enter a round with 1 token each, you both have a 50&#x2F;50 shot of winning the other&#x27;s token.  Here&#x27;s the catch.  Anyone can end the round at any moment, even people who haven&#x27;t deposited any tokens.<p>The contract is currently deployed to Rinkeby and I currently hold all of the Degen Raffle Tokens (DRT) needed to enter the raffle.  If you&#x27;re interested in playing, let me know and I&#x27;ll send you a few million.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d19h3r5ramsh27.cloudfront.net&#x2F;",
