      "text": "We started using Brex a month or so ago, having signed up with Brex using an affiliate link that promises certain point rewards after we spend X amount of money.<p>It doesn&#x27;t we are getting the points per the deal we signed up for, and their customer service just doesn&#x27;t respond to our requests. It&#x27;s not a whole lot of money — a few hundred dollars at most — but I thought the finance sector was pretty tightly regulated about these things? Isn&#x27;t this something like false advertising?<p>It&#x27;s been a couple of months now and it doesn&#x27;t seem like their customer service is replying anymore, and I&#x27;m considering filing a complaint to the CFPB and other agencies. I think it&#x27;s more about the principle, and feeling like getting swindled by a neobank &#x2F; not-a-bank that&#x27;s the most annoying part of it.<p>Otherwise, using Brex has been great. It&#x27;s just that getting pulled in as a customer under false pretenses leaves a seriously bad impression.<p>Has anyone else experienced this? Should I file a complaint or just let it go?",
