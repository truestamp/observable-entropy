      "text": "Today, a friend asked me how to transfer about 60 GB of images from her iPhone to her Windows computer, because the phone is so full that it&#x27;s not working properly.<p>The obvious answer is use a cable, but here cable seems to have a loose connection so it cuts out mid transfer. iTunes wants to make a backup which you can&#x27;t cancel and then the computer stops working.<p>My first thought was create a torrent file, send it to Windows via any chat app or mail and open it on the PC.<p>Now before giving her instructions I wanted to try the solution, although I do use an Android, but generally apps are more or less the same on Android and on iOS.<p>Following my common sense I downloaded the most downloaded torrent manager and then spent a few minutes searching for an option to create a torrent file. Being unable to find the solution, I went on Google...<p>&#x27;How to create a torrent file on iPhone&#x27;<p>Googles gave me only how to download torrents results. But I didn&#x27;t give up, I&#x27;m good with computer stuff!<p>&#x27;How to &quot;create&quot; a torrent file on iPhone&#x27;<p>More or less same results... Welp, let&#x27;s try Bing <i>don&#x27;t laugh</i>... No solution.<p>After about 5 hours of trying, she decided to go for a run and have a dinner.<p>Oh and she&#x27;s going to ask a friend to borrow her a cable and an iMac just to be sure.<p>I also wanted to try to SSH into the iPhone but you need to jailbreak it.<p>Google Photos has a limit of 15 GB.\niCloud has 5 GB.\nMega.nz has a limit of 50 GB.<p>Using a torrent would work, but if you can&#x27;t create a torrent file, then you can&#x27;t use the torrents.<p>Why is it so hard to transfer a lot of files from a phone to the PC without using the cable? Did I miss something extremely obvious?",
