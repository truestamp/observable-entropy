But for someone without the hind sight, looking into the future, what types of indicator would you look for? Also assuming that even if singularity is achieved (?) at some locations, the effects would take times to spread. Say it&#x27;s already reached at the opposite corner of the world. How long would it take for it to be apparent and what are some indicators? Also, happy thanksgiving.",
