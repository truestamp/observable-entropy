Would love to see some examples or even ideas that you have in your head (if you are willing to share) for potential products that are tackling climate change where impact can be high.<p>Can be anything from carbon capture, to renewable energy to alternative food and agriculture. Just looking for inspiration and see what other fellow hackers are working on.<p>One thing specifically I am trying to understand is which areas or verticals that need the most improvement.<p>I was also recently inspired by RedwoodJS launch and their fund for tackling climate change (I am not associated or affiliated). They are giving out some base funding for tackling such problems: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tom.preston-werner.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;04&#x2F;redwood-v1-and-funding.html",
