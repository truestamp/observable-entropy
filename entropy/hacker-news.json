      "text": "I hope this doesn&#x27;t come across as too tone deaf, but as a tech worker in the Bay Area who drives an electric car, I&#x27;ve experienced a very insignificant impact from inflation so far. Inflation is clearly real and doesn&#x27;t seem to be transitory, but even at 7(ish)% I honestly can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve felt it. I&#x27;m very aware of the $6&#x2F;gallon gas signs around the city, but I drive an electric car and my power bill isn&#x27;t noticeably higher over the past 12-18 months. Some of the coffee shops and restaurants I frequent have raised prices very slightly, but not enough to make any real impact in my quality of life or savings rate. Inflation news articles and discussions are more and more noticeable around me, but practically speaking my life is no different than it was a year, or two, or three years ago. Am I just in a bubble?",
