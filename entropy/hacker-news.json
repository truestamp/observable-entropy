      "text": "Context: third world embedded&#x2F;kernel engineer, still in college but hey, the market is insane and I&#x27;m above the usual cut (not by much). Currently work in R&amp;D, doing said R&amp;D for big big first world companies.<p>I&#x27;m being paid peanuts, but I like the work. I fell for the &quot;staying for the tech&quot; and &quot;oh my god I can work in tech!!!&quot; memes but now the bills are catching up and I feel exploited when I give technical advice to people that receive way above my pay grade. Did I mention I&#x27;m still a junior but work as &quot;technical reference&quot; for one of the projects for those big big first world companies? It sucks.<p>I need advice. I feel like I&#x27;m too afraid to speak out for myself (I asked for a raise when another company wanted to pay me double, they agreed and they didn&#x27;t speak to me since...).<p>Any ideas? Do I need sense knocked into my head? Thanks.",
