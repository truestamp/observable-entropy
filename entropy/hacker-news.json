      "text": "The other day I was at a coffeeshop with free wifi and my laptop. I thought what the hell and I thought I’d run my XMRig in the background while I worked on computer. Maybe 30 minutes later the wifi in the entire shop shut down. I can tell it wasn’t just me cause I looked over and the people at a table next to me had no internet connection either. Did the store’s IT realize someone was using a Monero miner and shut down the entire shop wifi or was this just a coincidence. I’m not saying I’m going to do this again, but would using a VPN prevent this?",

      "text": "I have a Samsung Galaxy and I am happy with it. One reason I am considering an iPhone is for FaceTime calls (nothing on Android has similar quality). It can also serve as a replacement for non-android&#x2F;non-WhatsApp contacts on iMessage (I don&#x27;t use WhatsApp). The camera is subjective and gimmicky. Apple Maps has improved considerably. Build quality is acceptable (not as good as Galaxy) but again subjective. \nWhat is your take on this? Should I consider only for these issues or is there a a larger issue at play?",
