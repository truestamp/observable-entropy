      "text": "On the Wordle bandwagon...<p>I&#x27;ve created a two player Wordle - called Word Fight (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wordfight.me). Where you play others to guess the five letter word in less turns.<p>As one of the many Wordle obsessed, I play it daily with my partner. While we had our morning coffee a few months ago, competing with each other to see who could guess it in the least number of turns, I came up with this idea to make Wordle a two player game.<p>With a chess elo rating system, global ranking, and leaderboard - the Word Fight game helps us to answer the question: who&#x27;s better at Wordle?<p>I&#x27;d love feedback from the community, what works with the game, what doesn&#x27;t.\nAll feedback welcome at contact@wordfight.me<p>Thanks!",
