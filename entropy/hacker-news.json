      "text": "For those of you unaware, reddit is going thru another cultural revolution. Many top mods of the largest subs are upset because they feel spez isn&#x27;t cracking down on &#x27;misinformation&#x27; strongly enough.<p>They have either blacked out their subs, or placed stickied post at the top of the subs. They use these stickied post to push their agenda and advocate that readers move to reddit-alternative sites.<p>If you, the causal reddit user, comments negatively against this (ie. &quot;this post has nothing to do with the content of this sub and is harming the site&quot;), the mods will ban you. In effect this is their scorched-earth policy: Destroy the experience for causal users until they get their way.<p>What are spez&#x27;s realistic options here: (a) Capitulate, (b) Remove the mods, (c) Something else?",
