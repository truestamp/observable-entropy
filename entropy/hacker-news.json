It&#x27;s all a thinly veiled scheme to hijack human minds for the clergy&#x27;s own power and agendas.<p>If you really want to love your fellow human beings, don&#x27;t draw exclusive group boundaries and then focus primarily on helping only &quot;the members&quot;. This tribalism mostly succeeds at generating us vs. them mentalities and attitudes.  Is that really what a loving god would be about?<p>The Unitarian organization is okay (I have no affiliation, I&#x27;ve met a few over the years). The exception is because they leave most of the structure up to each individual to choose for themselves, and don&#x27;t pressure others to conform. The result is a group of genuinely curious folks.<p>See also: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31414788",
