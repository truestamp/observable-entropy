      "text": "A common hassle linked to having a phone is spam [robo]calls.<p>I&#x27;d love to have an IVR app answering my phone calls, so that it plays a pre-recorded menu and asks callers to press a digit to actually call me. Ideally, I would ask people to press a different number depending on the call&#x27;s nature (think commercial offer vs job-related call vs friends&#x2F;family vs emergency), and I&#x27;d love to even have a &quot;secret&quot; code for special people that would make the phone actually ring even while I&#x27;m asleep.<p>Android being open-source, I guess the Telephone app source should be available, so maybe someone already built some programmable capabilities on top of it?",

It seemed Google was aware of this, as over the last few months they made little improvements, like images for the items and automatic sorting. Well today Google updated its list app, and removed almost all of its features, including the ability to even manually sort. Thanks Google.",
