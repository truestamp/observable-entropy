      "text": "I&#x27;m attempting to self-study mathematics, and I&#x27;m having a very hard time with proofs. My formal maths education goes up to calculus II. I&#x27;ve never taken linear algebra, for example, and trying to learn it with a textbook like Linear Algebra Done Right is very difficult. I have a terrible time even making it through the first set of exercises once proofs come into the picture.<p>I&#x27;ve heard many many times that you can only learn math by doing it, which is certainly true, and is akin to saying that you can only learn a language by attempting to speak it. But to begin to learn to speak well, one must hear tons and tons of speech. Similarly, to begin to learn to write well, one must read tons and tons of writings.<p>Are there any resources for people who just want to read proofs? Preferably well-commented ones suited for beginners like myself who are trying more to get a feel for proof as an activity rather than trying to learn any particular branch of mathematics through them (at this point).",
