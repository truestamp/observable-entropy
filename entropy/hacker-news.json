      "text": "I’m reading through The Pragmatic Programmer again, this time stopping at each tip along the way and thinking about my work and how what the book is talking about applies to me.<p>The first tip is to “Care About Your Craft”<p>I had to realize that I haven’t really cared about the craft in some time. I’ve been sailing through a series of meetings, deadlines, changing project requirements, office politics and general life that the caring of the craft is at the bottom of my list of cares.<p>I used to care about the craft in detail: getting formatting in code right, following best practices, seeking the new more efficient way to do things. But now it’s just get it done and push onto the next thing.<p>Thankfully starting to do some summer technical book reading has ignited that care for craft in me again.<p>So I ask you all, do you care about your craft? Why or why not?",
