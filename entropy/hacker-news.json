      "text": "I&#x27;ve got some RGB images I&#x27;d like to print, at local printer and on print on demand sites. Apparently I need to convert to CMYK for best results. Is there good free software where I can convert RGB to CMYK and then adjust the saturation, contrast, brightness etc (as CMYK)? Thank you.<p>(So far I only know of Scribus, but seems it can only <i>save</i> as CMYK, not adjust the levels.)",
