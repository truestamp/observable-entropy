      "text": "I remember in the past seeing a couple different sites that tracked HN submissions to identify which ones had been flagged, pushed down, killed, etc.<p>Is there such a site today? If so, can I get the link? If not, it would be great if someone (with the time&#x2F;motivation&#x2F;skill) could build a new one and maintain it over the long term. Maybe even push the data to a blockchain or something.<p>Obviously this should be a feature of HN itself, it&#x27;s pretty simple, but in lieu that it seems incredibly important for someone to build and maintain it.<p>Even though the recent complaints about YC&#x2F;Stripe are not fully founded (IMHO) there is no doubt that YC&#x27;s dominance over the tech community&#x27;s conversations is something to be watched very closely. They have their thumb on the scale.<p>There have been shenanigans in the past and there will be in the future. The conflict of interest is simply too strong.<p>The most obvious issue today is that HN doesn&#x27;t prevent voting rings for sufficiently large organizations, like YC itself. Why doesn&#x27;t it prevent them? Well, the answer is obvious: they have a massive incentive not to. Why isn&#x27;t there a transparency log for moderation? Same answer.",
