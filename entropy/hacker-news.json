It is difficult to select text, and then the Copy menu doesn&#x27;t appear, etc.<p>Sometimes it can take an entire minute or two just to copy a paragraph.<p>Then there is the pasting... I select the textarea and watch the Paste menu appear, then disappear as the keyboard slides into view, followed by several more taps inside the field...<p>Select All seems to have been removed as a feature altogether at some point.<p>Is there a browser out there that will, for example, show me just the main text segments from a page and let me toggle-select them, and then copy?<p>Any other ideas for my use cases are also welcome, in case I&#x27;m creating an XY problem here.",
