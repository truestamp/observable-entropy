      "text": "Hey hey people,<p>I spent about 2 years learning japanese basics and then I went to japan for and exchange. I spent a year there and I’ve even went through the JLPT exam with a scored level of JLPT3. Overall I’d say my level dropped to JLPT4<p>My vocab is okay and I still remember some kanji. All this really happened few years ago and I’d like to get on track with this language.<p>I used textbooks but the reaction of japanese people on the grammar made me drop it. Is here anyone who could recommend me some books on this language. Thank you very much.",
