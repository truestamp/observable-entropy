Now all my content is served via the same YouTube interface everyone else has, and they can control whether I&#x27;m good weird or bad weird.  Even if I&#x27;m good weird, I&#x27;m probably too wordy for their algorithm.. Which.. If the algorithm were a person, they&#x27;d be the dumbest and smartest person in the room, you certainly couldn&#x27;t talk to them.  An intelligence that is unintelligible decides whether or not I&#x27;m popular on an interface i used to come to escape popularity contests.",
