      "text": "Hi HN,\nAfter about 10 years, my old 2012 Mac Mini is slowing down. I’d like to invest into another small package like the Mac Mini to continue my daily work - usually programming 80%, Content creation (Affinity Photo, GarageBand, etc.) 10% and games (CS:GO, Hitman) 10%.<p>I feel the M1 Mac mini will get the job done, but it’s about 2 years old now. Whereas the Mac Studio just launched and has all the power I will need for the next 5 years at least, but then, it costs twice as much as the M1 Mac mini where  I live.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts and advice. Thank you.",
