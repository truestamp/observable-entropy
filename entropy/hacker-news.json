      "text": "I&#x27;m a front-end developer looking to change careers. I work on a marketing team, and I&#x27;m not happy with my job anymore. Marketing is boring (to me) and the lack of any data-driven strategy on the part of my org seems like a waste of resources. I also feel like I&#x27;m stagnating intellectually as a result of investing so much of my daily energy into the field of Marketing.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve become absolutely fascinated by the field of data visualization. I&#x27;m extremely comfortable working with D3 and React, so I think pivoting into data visualization will \na) make me much more hireable and \nb) be something I actually enjoy doing that can make a meaningful impact on people.<p>Can anyone recommend any resources, certificates, or keywords I can use to help my portfolio and résumé stand out in the data visualization field?<p>Is it possible to get hired as a data viz engineer without a degree in data visualization? I&#x27;m currently building out my portfolio with a bunch of interactive visualzations to help support my résumé, but my BA is in the humanities.<p>Does anyone have any tips on self-education resources for the data viz field?",
