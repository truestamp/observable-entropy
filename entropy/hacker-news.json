      "text": "I worked for years as a freelance contractor in NLP. Clients and agencies generally consider sentiment analysis a simple matter. But the reality is off-the-shelf packages, like TextBlob are rule-based. When you put together an app, like a chatbot for customer services, they rarely work well. The cost to improve is nothing short of reinventing a new system, which most wouldn&#x27;t accept. Plus, the consensus is that people prefer self-hosted in-house solutions they can improve. Reasons to avoid sending texts to an external API are 1, privacy, and 2, per-call pricing.<p>So I have this idea. I create an open-source toolkit for sentiment analysis. It will be data-driven, not rule-based. So it can fit most use cases well. It&#x27;ll be a full package with GUI, for labeling, training, and an API server to self-host the model.<p>I keep a private repo of data to generate a good-enough model for a niche: customer service chatbots. A part of which is curated (scraped), and a part is labeled by myself. I sell a subscription to the model, during which period, I try to gather and label more data to improve the model. I can design the system to support partial training. That is, the customer can improve based on my model, using just hundreds of lines of their own data.<p>I figured if I priced it the right way (10-20% of hiring someone to create one), I can sell it to dev shops and agencies. I can go to Linkedin or Upwork to approach my customers.<p>Does this sound like a viable idea for a one-man shop?",
