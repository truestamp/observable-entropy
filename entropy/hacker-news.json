I don&#x27;t see any checksums to verify download integrity and some &quot;firmware&quot; files are hosted on filehosts such as Google Drive and Mediafire. There&#x27;s a Libredrive post by an admin (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.makemkv.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=18856), but there are no instructions at the time.<p>I want to flash in order to increase reading speeds and make my  (Libredrive-compatible) drive capable of ripping all current BD protections.",
