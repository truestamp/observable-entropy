      "text": "Hi homeschoolers! I’m wondering if you might be able to help me out. I’m trying to get some data around the social life of homeschoolers, because it doesn’t seem that there is any good data about it - and people make a lot of assumptions (many which are not true). To give you some context. I’m a teacher, and I’ve also started a new company that helps families design their children&#x27;s education (including academic, social and childcare needs). Several families have told me they would homeschool, but they are concerned their children wouldn&#x27;t have friends.<p>The purpose of this survey is to get a better sense of how lonely homeschoolers are relative to children in &quot;traditional school.&quot; We hope to get 2000 responses from homeschoolers around the world and share this data to better inform parent&#x27;s choices around homeschooling.<p>If you currently homeschool and would be willing to fill out this survey, it would help a lot.  Also, if you have any friends who currently homeschool and would be willing to pass it along to them, that would be a big big support. I want to collect at least 2000 responses so we can get some meaningful results.<p>Your answers are confidential.<p>Feel free to ask me any questions or give feedback on the questions, research approach or anything else. I’m not a professional data analyst or researcher so I realize there may be some room for improve. Thank you so much and have a wonderful day. \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLSfEOM3UB4RJm4VufSx3-asTl3pWtO_y1Ukw9Dp2CXLWtPVPDQ&#x2F;viewform",
