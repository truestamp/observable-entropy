I&#x27;ve been giving this quite a bit of thought and even embarked on The Odin Project, but still not sure if it&#x27;s a good idea for me.<p>A bit about me:\nMid-30s; based in US; established career in banking; upper&#x2F;middle management earning $250-300K; enjoy my work and have been doing well; I have a type of a role where I can shift to other industries (in a similar role)<p>Why I think learning programming is a good idea\n- Software is the future, there&#x27;s talk of DeFi potentially disintermediating traditional banks so need a hedge by developing an alternative skillset\n- I took some programming classes in high school and enjoyed them<p>Why I think learning programming is a bad idea\n- There&#x27;s an opportunity cost to my time. I have a family. More importantly, there ARE other skills that I can learn that stack well with my current career and increase my odds of landing a c-suite position over time\n- The amount of effort and time I will have to put to land a programming gig that pays <i>just as well</i> as my current gig will be immense (keep in mind I enjoy my current job as well as programming, so compensation will be a deciding factor)<p>Would appreciate some thoughts from people who work in the tech industry.",
