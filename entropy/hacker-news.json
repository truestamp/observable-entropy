      "text": "Today I was looking through Paul Grahams essays again. I find this format of writing very appealing. One topic per short text.<p>Then I realized that PG is the only one who&#x27;s essays I read.<p>There must be so many more!<p>Can HN suggest some?<p>I wrote &quot;essay writers&quot; rather than &quot;bloggers&quot; because somehow I fear that bloggers have a different approach to writing. Something like &quot;Hey fans, I have not written something for 3 days now. Sorry for that! Let me tell you about the great lasagna I cooked today ...&quot;.<p>What I am looking for is pieces of text someone has worked hard on because they had the feeling they have something meaningful to say.",
