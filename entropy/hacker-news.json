      "text": "Two thoughts after building for 2 years.<p>I think they apply to life in general ... Anyway.<p>1. Being more pragmatic.<p>Expecting to sacrifice a lot of your idea for the customer. We started out with this experimental exotic usecase for &quot;serverless&quot; tech (you can see the old posts on my profile) we thought was really cool. But people kept using it to host their web apps. Eventually we built a product for that.<p>Imagine engineers at Apple or Samsung. They spend years on building groundbreaking batteries and chipsets. And then people use their phones mostly for TikTok.<p>2. Doing what already has been done.<p>There&#x27;s this trend in startups to reinvent the wheel. In the beginning it&#x27;s very exciting (&quot;We&#x27;ll hire differently, and we&#x27;ll give stock differently...&quot;). But it gets tiring, and after a year you just want things to work.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re going fishing. You wouldn&#x27;t invent a new pole, a new camping chair, and a new way of catching fish. You would mostly use what is proven. Company-building is similar.<p>Let me know your thoughts\nJakob (building lightbottle.dev)",
