It represents the transformative layer after loading data from an original source. Dbt combines SQL with software engineering principles.<p>Here are my top5!<p>-  Lightdash (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lightdash&#x2F;lightdash): Lightdash converts dbt models and makes it possible to define and easily visualize additional metrics via a visual interface.<p>- ⏎ re_data (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;re-data&#x2F;re-data): Re-Data is an abstraction layer that helps users monitor dbt projects and their underlying data. For example, you get alerts when a test failed or a data anomaly occurs in a dbt project.<p>-  evidence (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;evidence-dev&#x2F;evidence): Evidence is another tool for lightweight BI reporting. With Evidence, you can build simple reports in &quot;medium style&quot; using SQL queries and Markdown.<p>-  Kuwala (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kuwala-io&#x2F;kuwala): With Kuwala, a BI analyst can intuitively build advanced data workflows using a drag-drop interface on top of the modern data stack without coding. Behind the Scenes, the dbt models are generated so that a more experienced engineer can customize the pipelines at any time.<p>- fal ai (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fal-ai&#x2F;fal): Fal helps to run Python scripts directly from the dbt project. For example, you can load dbt models directly into the Python context which helps to apply Data Science libraries like SKlearn and Prophet in the dbt models.",
