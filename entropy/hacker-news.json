      "text": "Steve Jobs promoted the &quot;personal computer&quot; with this concept that a bicycle (and a road) makes a human more efficient than any other animal, even a condor. And that a computer could amplify your mind in a similar way.  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L40B08nWoMk<p>Today, I&#x27;d say wikipedia and knowledge in general is the biggest contributor (though, more internet than computer). The spreadsheet, in Jobs&#x27; time, was probably a pretty good example.<p>But I personally find that computers haven&#x27;t helped my mind at all. Mathematics is still hard. Formulating and articulating ideas is still hard. In a nutshell:<p>deep learning doesn&#x27;t help you understand deep learning (e.g. gradient descent)<p>Has the computer been a bicycle of your mind?",
