      "text": "During Coinbase signup, it prompted me to provide ACH details. This makes sense -- an easy way to convert fiat currency to&#x2F;from cryptocurrency.<p>However, then they wanted me to sign in to my bank account using Plaid. When I tried to switch to just regular ACH details (routing&#x2F;ABA and acct number), the system forced a dark pattern and immediately switched back to Plaid login as soon as I entered the routing number (111000025 is Bank of America&#x27;s routing number.)<p>As I understand it, Plaid uses your bank login to grab your checking account history (all transactions) as well as sharing this information with Coinbase. Why does Coinbase <i>force</i> this requirement, but only for banks that it knows it can gain access to this data for? What if I switch to a local community bank?<p>Are there other exchanges that don&#x27;t require this security and privacy nightmare and outsource all this information gathering to Plaid? Isn&#x27;t my ID enough, and why does Coinbase want access to this information that isn&#x27;t required for KYC compliance?",
