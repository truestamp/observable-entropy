      "text": "When I was in middle school circa 2010-2011 and Facebook was just coming out I created an account with an embarrassing profile picture and posts&#x2F;likes. Now I’ve forgot the password and it’s the #1 result on Google when you search my name. I’ve tried all ways to recover the account, but the only option is to enter a password. It’s ruining my professional life and taking a major toll on my mental health. Is there any way to get it taken down or should I begin the process of changing my legal name? If I do so will I be able to have it updated on my ID &#x2F; Birth Certificate &#x2F; SSN card?",
