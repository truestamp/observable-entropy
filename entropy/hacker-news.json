      "text": "Hey HN, this is Caleb and Zach, we co-founded Vault after realizing how behind the times consumer-facing tech was in the sports betting industry.<p>After creating various products and prototypes for sports bettors for most of 2020 (many with little&#x2F;no success), in early 2021 we realized a key problem that sports bettors faced...<p>Most of them were tracking their bets, ROI, and net profit using Excel tables or other forms of manual entry.<p>Gaining inspiration from fintech apps such as Intuit Mint and CoPilot, both of which link with your financial accounts and aggregate your data, we created Vault. An app that links with a bettor&#x27;s sportsbooks (i.e. DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars) and aggregates that data.<p>Would love to hear your thoughts, and feel free to reach out to Zach and I at info@vaultsportshq.com",
