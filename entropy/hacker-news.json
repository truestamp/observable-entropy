Looking at their current live policy, it appears I&#x27;m below their &#x27;following&#x27; count threshold they&#x27;ve implemented after I joined, so perhaps this was an automated task they&#x27;ve actioned to backwards-apply the rules. Surprised there was no warning...<p>Anyone else experienced this?<p>Leaves me convinced that you cannot treat a single platform as a reliable source of income, only ever passive or grouped with many providers.<p>This won&#x27;t stop me posting on Medium, as it&#x27;s a great platform to share technical knowledge with others.",
