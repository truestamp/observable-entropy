      "text": "I&#x27;m an application architect for a brand new application. The application uses tons of data from multiple external systems. New data tables needed to be created for the application too. The person that designed the application is not technical at all.<p>I did the best I could with the information I had and we are slowly starting to see a working prototype, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions that I&#x27;m trying to figure out. The project is behind. I want to take responsibility for it being behind. But at the same time the project seems understaffed and it appears too much is being asked considering the size of the team.<p>What could I have done differently?",
