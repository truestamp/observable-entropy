Anima guides you through a review of your thoughts, feelings, habits and relationships with others. Anima also allows you to set meaningful goals.<p>I would appreciate your feedback on the prototype. You can try it for free:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anyma.bubbleapps.io<p>I am a psychologist and neuroscientist. I graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree from University College London, where I analysed brain scans, created mathematical models of decision making and used brain stimulation to modulate human learning. I always wanted to create a digital model of the individual and I hope that Anima will grow closer to this vision in the future.<p>I would really appreciate your feedback on how to develop the product further and create value for you.",
