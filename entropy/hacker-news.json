      "text": "Today, I went to the store and dropped my wife off to buy a few things.  I stayed in the vehicle and she went shopping.  It was a Winn Dixie.<p>After a couple minutes, I remembered things we were out of so called and asked her to buy, specifically, peach preserves, pancake mix, and hamburger buns.  It was a Gvoice call made via my GM bluetooth car system.<p>Tonight on slickdeals, my first top deal was Krusteaz pancake mix, then later, Smuckers peach preserves.<p>These are not popular items, and not things I&#x27;ve ever searched for or bought online.  I&#x27;ve never seen them on slickdeals.  In fact, the peach preserves were a great deal, but I didn&#x27;t click it because well, it&#x27;s weird.<p>So who is to blame?  We both use Google voice, so that was my first suspect. However, it could be the credit card&#x2F;L3 data also.  It&#x27;s a capital one card in her name, but under my account.<p>We typically shop together, I use Amex, and it&#x27;s never crossed like this.<p>I&#x27;m going to cancel something soon, so please anyone with ideas, shoot them at me.",
