We write good code and know how to coach teams, so they practice devops themselves.<p>We want to work with new-ish startups setting them up straight on AWS and coaching dev teams how to utilize it.<p>Or medium size companies, that got themselves into a dev mess for one reason or another.<p>We think about short term, fixed duration projects.<p>Question: where to find leads?<p>Right now I&#x27;m chatting with people who post &quot;devops&quot; jobs in various slack #jobs channels. Almost everybody got a huge, huge pile of tech debt and not very pretty dev processes (which again, we have experience fixing or improving substantially).<p>But most of these folks trying to find full time devops :(<p>Where else can I look for leads?\nAnd how can I persuade these folks talk to us first? Before they drop tens of thousands on ft hiring<p>Cheers!",
