So far, they have contacted LinkedIn multiple times since 2020, but have had no success so far. They are attempting to set up a meeting with Microsoft&#x27;s general manager in Costa Rica to see what can be done. Is there someone from LinkedIn in HackerNews who could direct this issue to the correct person internally? This is the fake profile: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;school&#x2F;universidad-de-costa-rica&#x2F;",

      "text": "I&#x27;m not sure if this is a cause of more people moving to remote-first and difficulty showing emotions over slack&#x2F;messaging as the main communication, or just people stressed out over covid in general.  Since we went remote-first company-wide, emotions spike way more easily on the negative when something goes wrong.<p>I haven&#x27;t experienced this myself since I&#x27;ve been at the company fairly long and had been remote for about three years prior to Covid hitting.  I&#x27;m not sure if I just learned how to conduct myself in a virtual setting or if this is the norm.   But I&#x27;ve seen coworkers lash out on others over what could be an easy fix or mundane item fairly often.<p>Just wondering if others are dealing with similar issues and how you handle a confrontation over video where one is talking over the other, or over Slack, where neither reads the other&#x27;s responses and continue to cherry-pick pieces of a response escalating an argument.",
