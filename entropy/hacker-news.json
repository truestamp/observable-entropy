This is already a software-wise isolated application (obv not on the hardware side but lets leave that out for a second), of which I can run multiple on the same system. Why do I need docker on top of that?<p>I am probably misunderstanding something fundamental here so for the 21375th time, what is an idiot-proof explanation for the need of docker in light of dlls?",
