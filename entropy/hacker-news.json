Collaborators (both technical and non-technical) can join the playground, review and leave comments on top of the preview environment itself. Comments are also synced to Git, making the code reviews faster and feedback clearer. And since all reviews (even the less-technical ones) are done instantly and asynchronously, developers have fewer distractions and context switches to contend with.<p>Our platform is self-serve and free to use.<p>We&#x27;re excited about how much we can help developers do their best work, and so we&#x27;re determined to reach even more relevant folks.<p>We&#x27;re even willing to pay you to try it (for a limited time).<p>Our offer is pretty simple - to the next 20 relevant developers who think this is something that can benefit you and your team, we&#x27;ll send you a $25 Amazon gift card if you do the following:\n- Sign up to Livecycle (free)\n- Connect your Git and run a build\n- Post a screenshot of your Livecycle preview env&#x2F;dashboard on Twitter and tag us @get_livecycle (to let us know that you&#x27;re up and running successfully)<p>And if you give us more detailed feedback and&#x2F;or invite others to collaborate on your Livecycle playground, we&#x27;ll even throw in some free swag - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.livecycle.io&#x2F;.<p>Any questions - please let us know!<p>We know this might sound spammy, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s legit. We&#x27;re being totally up front about this. We&#x27;re just excited about our product and so we&#x27;re offering a limited-time incentive to our next round of users.",
