      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>I&#x27;m a 31 year-old back-end developer. I&#x27;ve worked as this job for about 6 years and I learned everything on the job. I got my bachelor&#x27;s in Software Engineering at 22 but I started working as a developer way later (at 25).<p>After moving to a new country I realized that going to a terrible college and not learning anything during my undergrad was a huge mistake.<p>I know a lot about complex, data-intensive systems because I was lucky enough to work at a start-up that hit it big. My resume is impressive in the eyes of the recruiters but goddamn, I am literally clueless about algorithms, data structures, and everything else they teach you about during undergrad so I cannot pass any coding interviews.<p>Nobody cares about real-world skills and they&#x27;re all asking me to implement data structures that are just names to me at this point.<p>How do I unscrew this situation?\nGet a masters and possibly a specialization? Go to coding bootcamps? Pivot into another job?<p>I think pretty good with systems administration too but I feel like I won&#x27;t have many career options after that.<p>Any help or suggestion is appreciated.<p>Thanks in advance.",
