      "text": "I had a bit of free time and i wanted to play a game that I was quite fond of a bit over a decade ago, aoe2. I never tried their new remastered edition, but since most players moved over i was planning on trying it out.<p>So i grabbed a slightly older laptop that i knew it had a Windows partition. On most of my machines i use Linux, and generally have no need for other OSes.<p>So what happens is that a notification keeps coming up asking me to &quot;restart to finish installing an update&quot;. I ignored it a few times, but then I thought, heck, let&#x27;s do it, can&#x27;t be more then 5 minutes. Now, more than 2 hours later it&#x27;s barely at 25% and the system is completely unusable for other tasks.<p>This seems to be a frequent occurrence. I don&#x27;t understand how a product with such a user hostile behavior can still be on the market.<p>If i was at home, i would just reinstall a clean version. That is much faster.",
