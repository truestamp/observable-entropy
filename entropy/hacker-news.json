I (still) know my stuff.<p>I&#x27;m growing weary of the role though. There&#x27;s a lot of disfunction in the organization, and I spend more time solving organizational issues than technical ones. And while it&#x27;s been my ability to solve _both_ technical and organizational issues effectively that&#x27;s gotten me to where I am now, I get little satisfaction from the latter.<p>Some days I feel like I would be happier just jumping back into an individual contributor role and making the best of the infrastructure, architecture, automation, and other such skills.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear stories from anyone else who&#x27;s found themselves in a similar position. How&#x27;d it go? What was the reaction from your next employer? Did you stick to the individual contributor role, or did old habits kick in and land you back in management anyways? And of course, one of the most burning questions on my mind... what happened with compensation?",
