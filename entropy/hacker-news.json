      "text": "I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea for months, but not sure how much time&#x2F;energy I want to commit to it -- my current thinking is I can do it for a year, then hand it off.<p>I&#x27;m not completely sure a 4-day work week is a good thing -- from a Bernie&#x2F;socialist&#x2F;anarchist-type perspective -- but my gut says &#x27;yes, at least a little bit, and on a massive scale, that is probably worth spending some time on.&#x27;<p>My primary argument in favor of the 4-day is it would allow relatively powerful white collars workers to engage more in the political system, possibly education and organizing generally -- just because they&#x27;ll&#x2F;we&#x27;ll have more time. That&#x27;s the theory. I could use to do some research generally on time off, and specifically, on the history of the weekend, to see if that happened in the past.<p>So, could we use a 4-Day advocacy org?",
