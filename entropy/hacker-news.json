You have to create a liquidity pool, maintaining which can take a lot of time and effort.<p>Our tokens are all minted on a bonding curve, so your tokens can be bought and sold from day 1.<p>For the membership NFTs - \nWe&#x27;re streamlining the entire process of designing and generating NFT membership tiers, so all you have to do is fill out a few forms and your landing page for the NFTs will be up and ready :)<p>Sign up and let me know what you think!<p>______________________________________<p>Here are our socials -<p>Twitter - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;joinstarpad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;joinstarpad</a>\nDiscord - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;gCMAZ6GfdQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;gCMAZ6GfdQ</a><p>Webapp - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.starpad.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.starpad.xyz</a>",
