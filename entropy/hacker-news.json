      "text": "I read the popular article a few days ago about the person who works in VR using the Quest2. I was so inspired I bought one to try it out. My initial reaction is that it is SO BLURRY that it is unusable. If you google &quot;oculus quest 2 blurry&quot; you will find thousands of other people saying the same thing. How is this possible? How are some people able to use this and other people find it unusable?<p>Basically there is an incredibly tiny &quot;sweet spot&quot; in the very middle of your view, and everything else is painfully blurry. (note: I&#x27;ve used other VR, never had this issue)",

      "text": "So this comes from the recent Release of New World from Amazon. They have a hard cap of 2k players and 2-3x that per server I&#x27;m queues. They are adding more servers often but usually not enough.<p>Now, I love the MMO genre and have been through many MMO launches, and this isn&#x27;t new to me. But as a DevOps engineer, I wonder how we haven&#x27;t improved server tech to minimize or remove this?<p>I don&#x27;t know much about MMO servers out outside of the one I&#x27;m building for an old MMO, but I feel like a new modern MMO should have some innovations to solve server capacities or so many servers.<p>Why does it feel we have made no progress towards limitless servers, or single world games where you have fleets of servers handling 1 world.<p>I understand the complexities of latency, server to server syncing, database capacity lits, etc. But I feel like those actually making MMO servers for a living have the expertise to make this better.<p>And then there is Amazon, they have the entire power of AWS to add servers quickly. I don&#x27;t get how they can&#x27;t have scaled extra servers on day 1 and day 2 with some cloudformation, terraform, docker, kubernetes, or whatever is the right tool for quick provisioning.<p>Just want to start a discussion to see more view points, maybe some expertise of those working on MMO game servers, etc. There is obviously things I&#x27;m not aware of or not taking into account, but I would like to know.",
