The resemblance ends there and the products are not related.\nConsequently, I quickly got experienced in the technologies used in my team&#x27;s scope.<p>Is this kind of similarity, using the same &quot;toolbox&quot; you use at work for side projects, an issue when deciding to open source a project?",
