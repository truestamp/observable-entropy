      "text": "This question is related to learning programming languages or computing technology. For example, do you prefer reading (printed) programming language books even though there are thousands of online courses? Or do you prefer online tutorials or courses?<p><i>Books</i>:<p>- Can be read away from a computer (no online distractions)<p>- Reading on paper is more comfortable that reading on a monitor<p>- Possibly imparts a deeper understand of material (subjective)<p>- Computing-related print books have technical reviewers and an editor to maintain high quality (debatable?)<p>- A book will inevitably be constrained by it&#x27;s length - not all topics can be covered<p><i>Online courses or tutorials</i><p>- Show screens and commands more easily and in real-time<p>- Easier to update and return to newer or refreshed content<p>- Animation can help explain concepts<p>- Listening to an expert won&#x27;t necessarily make their online course good i.e. not everyone is good at explaining or teaching<p>---<p>Printed books vs online courses: which do you prefer and why?",
