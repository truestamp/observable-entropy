      "text": "I am at a point in my career where I don’t really care about my work that much. I am successful, have full autonomy, get recognition, make more money than I need, I work on things that are intellectually stimulating, in a field that has some direct benefit to humanity. But still feel unsatisfied…<p>Many others in my field (aerospace) have a lifelong passion for it, but I don’t particularly care for it either way. I am envious of the enthusiasm they have for our work, that I cannot muster up.<p>There are other areas outside of my chosen profession that I feel more strongly about, and wondering if I should pursue those.<p>I feel like I have ascended up Maslow’s hierarchy of job needs, and now am faced with a lack of purpose in my work. So I am curious, has anyone changed jobs&#x2F;careers to align with a greater sense of purpose? How has that gone for you?",
