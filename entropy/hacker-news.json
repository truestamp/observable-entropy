      "text": "Hi everyone,\nSome context: I have 6 years of experience as a DevSecOps engineer. My work involves code review, security testing, integration of security tools into CI&#x2F;CD pipelines and development of internal security services &#x2F; tools for Developers and DevOps teams.<p>After a self-reflection on the different things that I have done, I found myself enjoying building things and promoting good security practices.<p>I wonder if there any good tips on how to transition from security to software development? How should I position myself when applying for software engineering jobs?<p>I know one of my weaknesses is the lack of knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms. And I will need to re-study the DSA topics again and practicing leetcode. Another weakness is the lack of understanding about software performance.<p>Thanks for reading this.",
