It got me wondering why monitors are almost always wide aspect and the &quot;productivity&quot; moniker is reserved for ultra wide aspect monitors.<p>I admit to not having spent significant time using ultra-wides, and am still writing this on my laptop screen, but everything from writing to scrolling restaurant websites is actually great on a vertical screen. UX today is always made to work well for mobile and having a giant mobile experience seems natural.",
