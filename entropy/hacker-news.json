I&#x27;m currently CS undergrad in India and interning at a remote company.<p>While looking for remote internships for summer &#x27;22 in the Americas and Europe, it frustrates me to see how many good fitting opportunities (for me) are just not available because they are remote but only in the region&#x2F;timezone, or require visa authorization.<p>Are companies out there even offering <i>worldwide</i> remote internships? If they are, what&#x27;s the best way to find them?<p>Cheers y&#x27;all.",
