These were not easy to customize (Amplify Next.js) or would pass your code and credentials via a 3rd party service (Serverless Next.js component). So we decided to fix it.<p>There are a couple of things to note, specifically the AWS integration.<p>- Completely open source and free<p>- Deploys directly to your AWS account<p>- Import environment variables from your AWS services<p>- Easily manage permissions to your AWS resources<p>- Works with any CI service, supports PR&#x2F;preview deployments<p>- Uses AWS CDK to define your infrastructure as code<p>We wrote about how to get started and compared the various deployment options: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serverless-stack.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;how-to-create-a-nextjs-app-with-serverless.html. You can also check out the docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.serverless-stack.com&#x2F;constructs&#x2F;NextjsSite<p>We&#x27;d appreciate if you took it for a spin and gave us some feedback!",
