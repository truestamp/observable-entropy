      "text": "An engineer (non-software) friend of mine asked me if range() was a function that had been added recently to Python, or if his professors just never showed it to him.<p>I told him range() has been there since the 90s and that his professors were just bad at Python. The thing is, I&#x27;m not actually sure about the first part. I know the history of some features, for example, I know that list-comprehensions were only added in Python 2 around 2000 and I know that map, reduce, and filter were added pretty early (like 1993) by programmers who were familiar with lisp. But I&#x27;m finding it really hard to find out when specific, arbitrary features were added to Python (or to other languages).<p>Google is no help because regardless of how I structure my query or tweak the search options, it just shows me endless SEO drivel sites that are only remotely related to what I searched. Anyone have a better way to find out stuff like this?",
