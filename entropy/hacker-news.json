And from my conversations and answers to my questions, I was excited to work for these people.<p>I know we can&#x27;t guard against people outright lying, but beyond that, if you can&#x27;t find someone who&#x27;s worked for them and will give you the unvarnished truth, what are other things people can do when considering working for someone?<p>Or is this ultimately just a risk one has to take?",
