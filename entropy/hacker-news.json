      "text": "Hello! I wrote an introductory SRE Book:<p>Site Reliability Engineering Tidbits<p>and it&#x27;s free today!<p>These are short fun chapters about SRE, monitoring, debugging, observability, and resiliency.<p>This book aims to provide hands on examples of implementing a number of concepts described in Google&#x27;s SRE books. It also describes how i&#x27;ve seen SRE concepts impact some of the organizations I&#x27;ve worked in.<p>A couple chapters are hands on debugging exercises going through the process of debugging applications based on data. I&#x27;m excited because every chapter describes something that I&#x27;ve done in paying jobs, so it documents real life SRE in action at various size organizations, and not theoretical SRE concepts.",
