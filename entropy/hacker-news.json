      "text": "For experienced lisp users: how important have metalinguistic capabilities been for your work? How often do you create DSLs, interpreters, compilers, language extensions, syntactic features, etc.?<p>For those of you who find it vital to the way you work&#x2F;think, do you think the same level of power is possible with anything other than Lisp?<p>Would you rather work with a system that embeds various computational approaches into an environment with metalinguistic capabilities, such as lisp? Or would you rather use a system that glues together various tools that are focused on whatever approach is needed for a specific piece?<p>By computational approaches I guess I mean a lot of different things here. Functional, imperative, and relational programming. Binaries, web UIs, desktop GUIs, etc. I think the main difference would be having different pieces be first class citizens in the core environment.",
