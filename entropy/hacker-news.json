      "text": "These days most companies are hiring remote (at least in some bubbles, like the “Who is hiring” thread). But most of those that are US companies are <i>”Remote US only”</i>. Why?<p>I understand that if those companies were to hire people outside the US as FTE it would require them to establish a presence in that country. But why not hire remote outside the US as contractors?<p>I am lucky to be hired as a contractor by a US company living outside of US. The process is very straightforward forward. I signed a contract and I send my invoice every month, along with a US bank account where they can deposit my salary (myself I use Payoneer, as I don’t have a US bank account). It ends up being a <i>less</i> bureaucratic process for the company, not more.<p>In my case I am treated as a FTE (a permanent employee, part of team, part of the decisions, the whole thing), only happens that my contract is of a contractor. I don’t have any benefits, but, in my case, the salary arbitrage to the cost of living in my city more that compensates that.<p>I would like to know why those company that hire “remote US only” are not open to that. Which risks&#x2F;cost I am not seeing?",
