      "text": "The Googlebot has a crawl budget which limits how deep into a website it&#x27;ll traverse relative to a given entrypoint. This can lead to unexpected omissions, for example Github issues with a high number and few or no cross-references.<p>For example: apache airflow issue 9939.<p>This issue wasn&#x27;t indexed by the Googlebot and can&#x27;t be found using Google Search.<p>And yet, stumbling upon such bits of information can be important and there&#x27;s an expectation that Google can find everything on the public internet.<p>How can internet users demand that big tech companies invest in such long tail problems and not just mainstream content which might be easier to sell ads for?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve found the Eufy option with local storage and it looks great, but still I have some privacy concerns. Also some people is complaining about delay with the notifications. If possible I would like it to run with battery but I guess I could install a cable one.<p>Another feature that I find interesting is to be able to switch off the internet access and only allow within the local network when I&#x27;m at home.<p>In the future I would like to setup more home automation devices like the thermostat and an alarm system. So I guess I should go for an open source approach. The problem I see too many options out there and the hardware part is even more confusing to me. That&#x27;s why I was looking in ready to use products. My developer skills are also very limited but I think I could learn this part.<p>But for now I would like to start with a good choice for my first device since my regular doorbell stopped working.",
