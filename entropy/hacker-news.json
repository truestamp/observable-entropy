      "text": "Founder here. Makers.so is a Figma Plugin to build and publish sites without ever leaving Figma. Here’s a demo [0].<p>As a front-end developer I constantly go from Figma to code &#x2F; site, but it’s tedious… I decided to automate the process with this plugin. It works great for simple projects like:<p>- Landing Pages<p>- Portfolio &#x2F; Personal sites<p>- Resume sites<p>- Careers &#x2F; Wiki sites<p>So, not a Webflow &#x2F; Framer competitor (yet). Webflow and Framer are amazing tools, but if you are in the Figma ecosystem, it&#x27;s boring to duplicate your work on a different tool. I&#x27;m trying to make life easier for Figma users.  If this seems interesting, you can install it here [1] and give it a try.<p>—<p>For a bit of context, I&#x27;m a solo-founder and I started Makers after sharing my idea on the Figma subreddit about how awesome it would be to have a button in Figma to publish my designs. A good amount of people seemed to agree, and that was enough to start working on it. This is turning out to be a super fun project, and I’ve been working full-time for the last two months.<p>[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;joaodmj&#x2F;status&#x2F;1488216877511884805?s=20<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.figma.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;plugin&#x2F;991438050654881175",
