      "text": "I know that you can already donate extra CPU cycles to computational projects like Folding@Home.<p>I am wondering how feasible it would be to create a Proof of Work system that verifies a blockchain where the number crunching ends goes towards a useful but difficult computational task (in addition to the innate utility that regular Proof of Work brings).<p>I think some people who first hear about Proof of Work assume it&#x27;s Proof of Useful Work (PoUW), at least I did. However I&#x27;m not savvy enough to tell the real PoUW projects from the scams. Does anyone know whether the idea is possible on principle, and if there are any existing implementations of the general idea?<p>Thoughts on whether this type of arrangement would even work as the basis of a store of value are appreciated as well.<p>Thank you.<p>Edit: I just found a previous discussion on the same topic: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27224415.",
