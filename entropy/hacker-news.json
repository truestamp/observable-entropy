Paranoia kicks in like &quot;this phone is listening to us&quot; or &quot;they can read our encrypted chat messages&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to find ways to explain this topic in simple, layman&#x27;s terms, but mostly failed by going too much into details and confused them even more.<p>What&#x27;s equally important is that I&#x27;d like to give them actionable tips so they can protect themselves and their friends &amp; family.<p>What&#x27;s your go-to explanation on this topic, and the best (simple) actionable advice on how they can protect themselves?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve purchased a new construction and have some choices in allowances but limited timeline. This is my first purchase and I&#x27;m not a networking expert by any stretch. I&#x27;ve asked for them to add flexible 1&quot; conduit from attic to each room, for future fishlineing, and they&#x27;ve upgraded from CAT5 to CAT7 at my request. This is the boundary of knowledge. -- I want to make sure there&#x27;s future proofed ability to upgrade in the event a local ISP gets fiber to the home, or otherwise better than copper.<p>Where should I go to learn more? Any basic tips or best practices? They will be foam spraying in a few days so I&#x27;m on a bit of a deadline to brush up,  not concerned with budget or all the bells and whistles as I am making future upgrades easier or possible.<p>Thanks !",
