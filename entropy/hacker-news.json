(You don&#x27;t need to even know how to organise the jobs in the pipeline, the tool will guide you)\nIt can support Gitlab, Github actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.",

      "text": "I am soon starting a project where I am in need of a JavaScript framework to do pretty much only very lightweight frontend work with. I have looked around at things like react, angular, vue, svelte, ember and so on but all of them seem pretty hefty for the purpose. I could use vanilla JS but I am in the mood for testing something new. The other parts of the tech stack are going to be node&#x2F;express, some css framework like tailwind or bulma and sqlite. Basically to be as &quot;portable&quot; as possible.<p>Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.",
