      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I’m tinkering and working on an app that solves a very common problem that many of you face (would tell you more but I’m building in stealth right now). I want it to be accessible to as many people as possible so I’m looking to offer a free version, with a twist.<p>I’m exploring different business models, and I’m interested if any of you would be willing to pay for privacy. For free users, I’d aggregate and anonymize user data, and for those that care about privacy, I’d offer a premium version, which collects no data &#x2F; offers enhanced privacy, along with a few other features.<p>Assuming that this is an application that you’d find useful, would you:<p>1. Use it for free - you don’t care about privacy (or care enough to pay)<p>2. Pay for privacy - if so, how much would you be willing to pay monthly (assume the app is comparable to social media or a search engine)?<p>3. Won’t use it at all (even if you assume it’ll be useful) - if not, why?<p>More food for thought:<p>4. If you could pay Google not to collect your data, would you?<p>5. If you could pay Instagram not to collect your data, would you?<p>6. If you could pay Facebook not to collect your data, would you?<p>Curious what you all think about this approach. Thanks for your time!!",
