      "text": "I&#x27;m reading <i>The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York</i>, which isn&#x27;t my first super-dense biography, but it got me thinking once again about reading strategies.<p>The book has an infinite wealth of details, down to specific dates on which a relative of the main subject said or did something - information I don&#x27;t need and can readily forget.<p>But it makes me stop and wonder why I&#x27;m spending time reading it in the first place. I feel like I need to be careful in how I read something like this, lest the time just be wasted altogether on the forgettable minutiae of history.<p>What&#x27;s your strategy for reading similar books, such that you take something away from it but don&#x27;t waste time on information you&#x27;ll immediately forget?",
