      "text": "Hello HN,<p>Regarding some upcoming elections, I want to create a website where people can &quot;match&quot; based on who they want to vote for. It&#x27;s not a dating site, it&#x27;s about finding a &quot;procurator&quot; to people who cannot vote the day of the election.<p>The profiles will only consist in some contact information and (optionally) for which candidate they want to vote. People will match in priority with those who want to vote for the same candidate (in this case, it&#x27;s easier to trust that the person voting on your behalf will do the right thing).<p>I think I know well enough how to make the website secure, but I don&#x27;t want to leave anything to chance: is it possible to somehow protect&#x2F;encrypt this data so that if the database leaks no one can find who each person wants to vote for?<p>Thanks!",
