      "text": "I have a gigabit internet hooked up for our coworking space, but due to the nature of businesses here, most of it goes unused. &quot;1Gig internet&quot; is a very good marketing message, so I am not going to downgrade. However, what should do I with unused bandwidth, ideally something that makes money?<p>A friend suggested running a Bitcoin miner, but that has a very long bayback period, assuming the price doesn&#x27;t sink. Not convinced this is a good idea. Is there anything else worth doing? Thanks!",
