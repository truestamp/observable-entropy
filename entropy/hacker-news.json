      "text": "Hi,\nafter a long job hunting period I joined a remote first company 5 months ago.<p>Problems showed up immediately in the form of chaos and dysfunctions in the microservices project I was hired in. Let&#x27;s put it this way: say you get the seminal book on microservices and CICD. And imagine almost everything in there done the wrong way. On top off that add vendeta-developers in India (I&#x27;m in a small offshoot team in Europe) handing down half-baked frameworks with minimal documentation and a culture based on meetings instead of documenting things. Developer sandboxes that just don&#x27;t work and unrealistic deadlines. In short a huge draining mess where I felt burnt out just a few months after I joined and where I honestly don&#x27;t want to spent another minute.<p>So, the question is, is it unprofessional to abandon ship just 6 months in or given the circumstances is exactly what I should do in order to protect my well being and my career prospects (the project is a slow train wreck IMO).",
