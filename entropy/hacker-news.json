      "text": "Hi HN.<p>Here is an idea for a cryptocurrency I have been toying with for a few days:\nIt can use any consensus algorithm that doesn’t require huge amount of energy as the number of user grows (so no Proof of Work).\nWhen a new block is added, part of the coins that get generated are sent to a few fixed wallets.\nThese wallets would be well known by all the nodes (so nodes can all validate that these are the right addresses) and would belong to a select few non-profit organizations that actively work in environmental restoration&#x2F;protection (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edenprojects.org&#x2F; or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theoceancleanup.com&#x2F;), carbon capture (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climeworks.com&#x2F;) and other related fields (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catf.us&#x2F;), I haven&#x27;t really thought of which organization to give to, this list is just an example.\nEach non-profit would need to publicly declare that they own these wallets to ensure that the coins aren&#x27;t being taken by a third party.\nThe list of organizations&#x2F;wallets could change over time, and would be selected by the community, probably with a formal process where anybody can create a proposal, then people can vote on them.<p>Here are a few questions that I have:\n- Are there any similar project already existing? I&#x27;d be happy to contribute to an already established project.\n- What are the problems you can foresee with this idea?\n- In particular, what are potential security issues here, how can I make sure no attacker can add custom addresses to this list?\n- Do you have any improvements to this?\n- Any pointer to an appropriate blockchain tech to build this on? I assume it would take far longer to implement it from scratch.",
