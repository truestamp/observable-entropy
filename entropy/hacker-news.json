Some of the I wrote, some of them I just get known and I left alone.<p>It&#x27;s hard to get rid of that legacy baggage, so that I think a &quot;fresh start&quot; will be the only option to get some air - but it&#x27;s almost impossible to stay in one company and have a fresh start.<p>If you are for a long time on one company: How did you survive?
