Mostly mobile and gaming.<p>I&#x27;m interested to take the leap and go fully into blockchain&#x2F;solidity.<p>I&#x27;m looking for some bootcamps, or online learning platform that can guide me towards landing a position as a solidity developer.<p>I&#x27;m actually interested to know any experience from other developers that took a similar leap.

Search Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping - nothing.<p>All hardware manufacturers make is the same old rectangular boxes.  There&#x27;s a very small number of unusual shapes, including one pyramid.  But for the most part even these &quot;unusually shaped&quot; cases are basically the same old design, pretty much a box with a motherboard in it, with unusual angles on the box.<p>Why is there so little innovation in computer design when the hobbyists are clearly showing what people like and are interested in?",
