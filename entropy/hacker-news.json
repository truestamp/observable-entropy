      "text": "I am a Python developer who loves Flask and uses Flask extensions in my applications.<p>Over time, I realized that some extensions are so used and become in some way the standard. \nThen after that, the maintainer of the extension is not available anymore and it is impossible to continue to improve the extension or fixing bugs. As an example there are flask-user, flask-restplus, flask-themes, and so on...<p>I think it&#x27;s time that the Flask community in general or Pallets Project in particular think about having a global community that will manage the extensions and maintain them, it&#x27;s really important.<p>One suggestion would be to have something like OCA (Odoo Community Association) that maintains modules from the Odoo Open Source community.<p>Let&#x27;s leave our egos aside and build a real Flask community.",
