Even the stock exchanges are fully incapable of reliably delivering historical trading data, in bulk, on a nightly basis.<p>I feel like I am paying an embarassingly large amount of money on a monthly basis to have half-wits screw things up in every which way imaginable.  Not only do I feel I&#x27;m paying for the service, I&#x27;m paying THEM to help them DEBUG.<p>In fact, I would jump on board immediately if I could not only get data from the west coast, but route TRADES through the west coast.  Isn&#x27;t DATA the stock markets&#x27; only job?  How can they get it wrong so frequently?",
