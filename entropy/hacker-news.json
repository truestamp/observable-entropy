      "text": "I&#x27;m teaching a 10-week, 4-hour-per-week Python programming class at the moment, and the target audience is mature-age career changers. At the end of the course, there is a state-sponsored &quot;apprenticeship&quot; program where most (but not quite all) of the students&#x27; salaries will be paid for 6 months; after which the employer can choose to keep them on or not as they want.<p>If you were a potential employer, what would you hire them to do, and what skills would you want from them?<p>My thoughts so far:\n- I think it&#x27;s necessary for students to understand ticketing (e.g. Jira) and how to commit code to git, what branches are and so on. I can&#x27;t imagine a job where this isn&#x27;t a required job skill.\n- An option: I can include Selenium in the course, so they could be employed in QA&#x2F;test.\n- Or, maybe I could teach them about the imortance of unit tests and the like; then they could be employed writing all those tests that you code-base doesn&#x27;t have, but should have.\n- Should I double down on (for example) Django?\n- I won&#x27;t have time to do a full machine learning course, but I could teach pandas and guide students towards data analytics roles in the sorts of organisations that do data analytics in Python (rather than Tableau or other BI tools).<p>What would help your job hiring pipeline?",
