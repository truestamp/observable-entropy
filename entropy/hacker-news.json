      "text": "Hello HN, Pablo here from Appfluence. DelayedSend (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delayedsend.com) is an add-in to schedule messages in Microsoft Teams. You can choose the time, the destination chat (personal or group), and of course the message itself. There is a dashboard to reschedule, edit, or cancel messages if you change your mind.<p>We built this because we work with both Slack and Teams, and we noticed the big convenience gap between the two, with delayed&#x2F;scheduled messages being one of the most glaring ones.<p>On the technical side, the app was built in less than a month, on Azure App Service with NextJS, which was also a fun way to learn something new for some of us.<p>The app is completely free, since it&#x27;s a bit of a side project for now, but we expect to add some premium features in the future, such as recurrence, rich formats, delivery alerts, etc.<p>I&#x27;d love your feedback! Happy to answer any questions.",

      "text": "Hi!<p>Was wondering if anyone has changed careers from tech (dev, engineering, mgmt, IT, etc)<p>Been doing this (web dev) for 5+ yrs and relatively successful. I believe in trying everything and so just becoming &quot;a better tech person&quot; for 40+ yrs doesn&#x27;t quite sit well with me. I have an MS in Comp Eng btw, just kinda more than burnt out and fed up with tech.<p>I&#x27;m open into discovering more opportunities with the Arts and Business, etc.<p>However, I acknowledge the pay prob won&#x27;t be nearly as much as what I could make in a traditional tech career trajectory..<p>What were your insights recommendations, etc.?",
