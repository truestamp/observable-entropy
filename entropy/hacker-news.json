      "text": "I&#x27;m regularly getting emails from contract recruiters about jobs at Intel. The pay rates are inevitably well below market rates.<p>For example, last week a couple of different recruiters contacted me about a compiler engineer contract job at Intel. They wanted compiler development experience, LLVM experience (including familiarity with backend optimization), excellent knowledge of GPU architecures, SIMD, vectorization, machine learning. When I asked what the rate of pay was I was told $65&#x2F;hour.<p>Again today 2 different contract recruiters contact me about another job at Intel: 5 years C++, 5 years Linux development experience, 5 years of Python, 5 years of embedded development experience. The pay rate? $44&#x2F;hour.<p>In both of these examples the rate of pay is about 1&#x2F;2 of what you&#x27;d expect. And they wonder why they can&#x27;t find people. What&#x27;s going on at Intel - do they just figure they&#x27;ll find someone in India or Eastern Europe to do these jobs? (for the first one it said you needed to be in the Pacific time zone or be willing to work on that schedule).",
