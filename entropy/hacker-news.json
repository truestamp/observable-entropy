      "text": "As the years go by and my family gets larger, the task of managing the budget and cashflow has grown in complexity and my trusty ol&#x27; spreadsheet is feeling a little inadequate. I&#x27;m looking for some advice&#x2F;ideas on how others plan and manage their finances when you have things like:<p>- Multiple, variable income streams (2 W2s, RSUs, real estate rental income)\n- Fixed monthly expenses (mortgage(s), subscriptions, bills)\n- Variable monthly expenses (groceries, gas)\n- Fixed yearly expenses (kid tuition, travel)\n- Investments (401k, ESPP) + retirement targets (total NW, age)<p>Specifically, I am looking for a system that manages away some of the complexity and leaves my wife and I with some tools and accountability for how much we spend out of pocket month over month in various categories. We don&#x27;t mind manual entry, but I am hoping to avoid straight up manual transaction entry + reconciliation for every dollar of outflow...but perhaps that&#x27;s unavoidable? Curious to see how the folks of HN do this and what ideas I might steal.",
