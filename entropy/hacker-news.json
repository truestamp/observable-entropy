      "text": "I came across a job definition today in my LinkedIn job feed. This is kind of a startup job, but the descriptions appear to be very thinly veiled from their real intentions. The lines with * are my interpretations.<p>- Those who use the word &quot;impossible&quot; are asked not to disturb those who try  \n* you will be asked to do the impossible and crazy stuff, but don&#x27;t complain\n- We don’t reinvent the wheel, others have already done it before us, so we reuse as much as possible\n* you should copy code from random github repos and complete work in 5 mins\n- Work smart, not hard\n* if you work overtime, its your fault. don&#x27;t expect compensation\n- Work should always be engaging\n* you should immerse yourself full time in work\n- We hate silos and break them with full transparency and communication\n* no clear role boundary. you need to do everything\n- We are not building tools but solutions\n* you are responsible for overall project or solution, thugh its not your role\n- We continuously improve by removing waste\n* you can be fired any time\n- We put our users first and generate value for them before all\n* you won&#x27;t be paid until our users are happy and pay us\n- We anticipate change and are adaptive\n* We don&#x27;t know what we are doing, but don&#x27;t complain\n- We focus on attention to detail and precision in everything we do\n* You don&#x27;t have scope for mistakes and corrections",
