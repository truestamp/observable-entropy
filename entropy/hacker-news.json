      "text": "I am really trying to get updates about or implementation samples from some very recent, hot, media darling AI projects, i.e.: Google’s Brax, OpenAI’s Triton, DeepMind’s Perceiver IO, TensorFlow’s Efficient Net V2… just to name a few since mid July. Still, I can’t find anything substantial yet from third parties out there. Am I missing something? Too new, still in progress, not public, just announced, too complex to digest? Please share your thoughts: being able to implement bleeding edge tech is too much a competitive advantage nowadays, I suspect, to make it in public. Or maybe there are so many novelties incoming, it is too difficult to extract coherent value? Thanks.",
