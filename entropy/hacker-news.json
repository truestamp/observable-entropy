Particularly, the often overwhelming desire to take a post-lunch siesta&#x2F;short power nap (as my work schedule allows).<p>I&#x27;m curious if this is some kind of natural thing that happens? And if others experience the increased desire to nap while WFH? Or if there&#x27;s other sleep changes you&#x27;ve noticed in a WFH routine?",
