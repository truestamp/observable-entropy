I don&#x27;t want to lose it in 10 or 20 years because some random country where the domain is based in decides to take it away from me or some other political issues.<p>Are only the traditional ones (.com, .net, .org) good for this purpose? For example .me is cool but it is the official TLD for Montenegro, or .ai which is for Anguilla. What about .xyz or .space? Can I rely on them?<p>Also feel free to suggest reliable registries.<p>Thanks!",
