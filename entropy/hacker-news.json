Currently, I run and maintain a very cost-effective semi-automated data-aquisition and ETL pipeline for them.<p>However, mutual understanding proved to be difficult between me as a unix-minded software engineer and the hardware&#x2F;business people running the company.<p>Often the founders&#x2F;CEO hear from investors about new technologies such as Kubernetes or cloud offerings from the big fishes such as AWS and Azure or some cathy term and believe just using them will immediately contribute to their success (it will immediately contribute to their costs with no clear gains, investores like it however).<p>How could I best support the founders and CEO in making a software product and let them focus on &quot;what&quot; needs to be done, instead of &quot;how&quot; to do it in your opinion? Or perhaps I need to change my expectations? Either way, I appreciate your input.<p>Thanks.",

I would much rather have several copies of every email all over the globe in a system which is fast and easy to sync, search, and reorganize, and which has easy recovery of deleted files: A self-hosted Git repository.<p>A quick search didn&#x27;t come up with any obvious candidates. There seems to be some projects out there for saving IMAP contents to various file formats, but none of the ones I found seem to have a big community, and I&#x27;ve no idea which file formats would be easily amenable to version control. Also, should I save the attachments embedded in the emails or as separate files (better version control and smaller email files, but breaks the explicit connection to the email file, and makes relocating them harder)? Finally, is there any reason why this is a terrible idea altogether, and I should just accept that personal messages from many years ago are just going to randomly disappear at some point?",
