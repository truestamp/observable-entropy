      "text": "I saw a skit where a salesperson asks for a raise, but the boss asks them, &quot;Did you design, code, and implement the features that you&#x27;re selling?&quot; Later an engineer asked for a raise, and likewise, the boss asked them, &quot;Did you sell the product? Did you do the marketing?&quot;<p>Technical skills are essential to building an MVP, but you still need to get the product out in the market to be successful.<p>If you&#x27;re an already established company, it makes sense to have some dedicated in-house marketing team, but what about when you&#x27;re starting? Ideally, you get a friend who&#x27;s good at sales, most likely a marketing major to help out, maybe become a cofounder. But there&#x27;s no harm in learning how to do more things yourself.<p>How can you learn about marketing to support the work you do as a developer? Where do you learn what you need to best prepare your projects for success?<p>Is there a way to learn how to do marketing basics yourself besides going to business school for X years?<p>(I&#x27;m going to try and look through my University&#x27;s course listings for their marketing major and try and skim the syllabuses for books to read, tho I know this isn&#x27;t very time effective).",
