      "text": " I recently received a received an offer to purchase a website I run. The website in question has no revenue but is a good candidate for ad revenue.<p>I have been unsuccessful in determining what kind of ad revenue the site could generate so that I can decide if the offer is fair or not. Using the various online tools which estimate values, I am getting estimates of $500-$2.2m for the overall website value. Obviously this is less than helpful and absurd on either end of the range. The site in traffic receives six figure daily users with ~10m of engagement time which makes me think ads would have decent monthly revenue.<p>Does anybody have advice or tips in determining how much a website is worth?",
