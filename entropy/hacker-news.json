      "text": "So I&#x27;ve been into web development for 4 years now. I&#x27;ve also been studying networking in the mean time and have been interested in cybersecurity too. Another thing I recently stumbled upon is blockchain - DApps etc. I want to be proficient in all of these fields. I&#x27;m thinking ultimately I want to become a great cybersec expert - have knowledge in lots of fields - like red&#x2F;purple teaming and all that jazz - so that&#x27;s why in the begging I thought that starting out as a developer is my best option since cybersec experts who truly know what they&#x27;re doing have programming experience. So what I&#x27;m wondering now is what to do next. I want to continue with SWE for now since I can&#x27;t get a job even as a pentester. In two&#x2F;three months I&#x27;m planning on taking AZ-204. Should I go with OSCP after that since I have to get going in cybersec. Point me to a direction since I want to learn everything. Thanks.",
