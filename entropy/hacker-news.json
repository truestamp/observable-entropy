      "text": "Hi there,<p>A founder of AI text writing assistant startup here. We have a small team of 4 experienced tech &#x2F; non-tech co-founders, 70% MVP done, a unique text analysis tool based on the mix of GPT-3 and top language models, a set of tools similar to conversion.ai, but more focused on a narrow segment of the market and a queue of 45 early users (trial period).<p>We exhausted our small FFF (friends, fools, family) $10k budget fast and had to switch to outsourcing development (as we worked before) to survive.<p>The question is: we still believe that we have a great potential to create so many incredible and valuable things in the scope of this product, we implemented like 0.000000000001% of what we can.<p>What is the fastest way to get $25k-50k investment to expand our startup and release the first public product version? Crowdfunding? Accelerators? Private investors?<p>Thanks.<p>Michael\nmksl@pm.me",
