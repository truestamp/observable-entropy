      "text": "I don&#x27;t want to go too much in to things, as it makes me sick to re-hash it and type things up again. Long story short, I was &quot;cancelled&quot;. Someone who has hated me for years convincingly mis-attributed decade old chat posts that contain vulgar, unsavory things to me, and convinced my last employer that it was me. Defamation would be one thing, but it has spread beyond it to social media and now my name is forever ruined. I admit, the evidence is convincing to the onlooker. This took place about 6 months ago and I am unable to get a new job since. (They never say the reason for not moving forward, but I know why) Until this, I had no problem switching jobs. Am I going to have to do odd jobs forever, or is there any hope of me returning as as the skilled software engineer I know I am? Would appreciate any and all help.",
