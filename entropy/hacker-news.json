      "text": "I am an early employee of a company that IPO&#x27;d in the last few years. As such, I am sitting on a (for me) life-changing amount of stock options - mostly already vested. Since IPO I have stayed with the company while many other early employees have left, because I love my job and love what the company do.<p>However, as an early employee with deep technical knowledge of our tech I find myself frequently brought in to advise on big deals or acquisitions. I am therefore often informed by legal that I am party to material non-public information about these deals and forbidden from trading company stock. This has happened now in three of the last four trading windows, and I have just been informed that it&#x27;s happening again.<p>So, do I need to quit in order to be able to realise the value of my stock options? It seems bizarre to me that I should be driven away from a job that I love by something that was meant to be an incentive to stay.",
