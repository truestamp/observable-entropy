Is there a service, watchdog, NGO, etc. out there that monitors for this sort of thing and would give speedy notice? I couldn&#x27;t find one.<p>I know about emergency alerts on phones in the U.S., but who knows how long it would take to get one of those (or even if .gov would decide to use it in the case of a single tactical nuke in a far-away land).<p>I&#x27;m also sure I could monitor Twitter &#x2F; Telegram &#x2F; Discord &#x2F; MySpace, but I don&#x27;t want to have to monitor anything. I want to get an alert as soon as possible after $EVENT == 1.",
