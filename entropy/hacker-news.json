      "text": "I was frustrated with drawing apps where the eraser was E and the pen was P. Often, when I&#x27;m drawing, I want to quickly erase and then switch back to the pen. As one of my hands is on my mouse or tablet, I have to use my other hand to reach across the keyboard. I wanted a drawing app with customizable keybindings, so I made qboard a while back and have used it since.<p>I talk more about the [design principles on the Github repo](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cjquines&#x2F;qboard&#x2F;#design-principles\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cjquines&#x2F;qboard&#x2F;#design-principles</a>). Hope you find it useful.",
