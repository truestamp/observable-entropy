      "text": "Hi all,\nAllthough reading much of it, this is my first post on this platform.\nAnyway, on to the question. I am currently using a Redmi Note 8 Pro, which I bought brand new when it came out. I am not a phone &quot;power user&quot;. I do not use it for fotography. Just for messaging and listening to music and I am very happy with the phone running a custom rom, obviously. When I bought this one I was so convinced that cheaper midrange phones (~200€&#x2F;$) were the best option for me, however, my view shifted a little in the past years. I was wondering if it was better to buy an older, maybe used or refurbished, high end phone or a new midrange one. I absolutely do not consider spending 1000 €&#x2F;$ whatever on a phone. I would rather spend that kind of money on my PC. In my opinion, new phones are all the same and it is boring. Since Sony kind of &quot;breaks the rule&quot; of new phones with their no notch (i hate the notch) 21:9 xperia 1&#x2F;5&#x2F;10 etc phones I might consider getting a xperia 1 iii when it gets cheaper used. What are your opinions on the topic?",
