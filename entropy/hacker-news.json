      "text": "I have had it with unreliable productivity tools in my daily life!<p>I get a Slack message from a coworker on the phone. I read half of it before clicking on the notification. (In retrospect, I should have read whole message before clicking). So I know the topic, just not the full message.. anticipation builds... while I wait for the POS electron based Slack client to connect back to Slack to retrieve the full message and show it to me. Low coverage isn&#x27;t helping. I take a U turn from the walk with my dog and rush back to my desk. No the Mac doesn&#x27;t show the message either. Frustrated, I go back to my iPhone notification to see if I can re-read what they wrote. No, Apple decides I don&#x27;t need the notification after I clicked on it.<p>Fast forward to rest of the day - Outlook has three version of Mac. The old-but-working version, the &quot;new outlook&quot; - someone rewrote a half-baked client in JS?? (another electron thing?), and there is outlook web version. The only one I can reliably get the search working is the web version. Yes, I know Apple spotlight controls how search is done in Mac. But the stupid client can&#x27;t even show me the email I just sent out 10 minutes ago. At least for some case, I blame the suckers who upgraded to Monterey [1], but I am still on Big Sur, not even enjoying Monterey, but just all the problems :(<p>Sigh, before the young one yell &quot;old person yells at the cloud&quot;, I need to call it a day and finish that walk with my dog. But wait, I can&#x27;t close my stupid window because unending notifications popup and it is right where I don&#x27;t want it [2]<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcommunity.microsoft.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;outlook&#x2F;search-not-working-in-outlook-2019-since-updating-to-monterey-12&#x2F;m-p&#x2F;3040518<p>2.  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apple.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;71989&#x2F;change-location-of-macos-notification-center-alerts",
