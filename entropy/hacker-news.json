      "text": "I&#x27;ve been thinking of ways to sandbox development-related programs&#x2F;processes&#x2F;data on the MacOS. A primary use case is to protect the whole system from the, for example, malicious NPM library. I&#x27;m aware that there is some application sandboxing built-in into the MacOS. However, I don&#x27;t know to what extent it covers this use case.<p>For this discussion, let&#x27;s consider full-fledged IDE, like IntelliJ Idea, and skip remote development using VSCode&#x2F;CLI editor over SSH&#x2F;TRAMP&#x2F;Projector. Also, examine a case where we would like to run multiple different applications inside the same sandbox for a specific project (e.g., IntelliJ + iTerm).<p>Please focus on the MacOS â€” I already know how to solve this issue on Linux.",
