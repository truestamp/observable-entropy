      "text": "We&#x27;re a relatively young B2C software startup looking for a designer that helps us position&#x2F;brand&#x2F;style our product more professionally. We are looking for a simple branding package to align the design of our applications and marketing material (logo, typography, icon set, colors, etc.). The budget is $5k - $10k.<p>Should we look for freelancers instead of agencies? We think that agencies have advantages like faster turnover and multiple involved people who bring in different ideas and concepts. The downside is the higher price.<p>Is the project&#x2F;budget too small for an agency?<p>Where do I look for good designers that fit our needs? Upwork, Dribble, Behance?<p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated!",
