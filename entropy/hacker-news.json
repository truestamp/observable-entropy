      "text": "I&#x27;m in a SW team where I find myself spending time and energy in dealing with pedantic no-value commends in my PRs. Most of them coming from a certain colleague who is clearly insecure and not as competent as the rest of the team. So she is trying to hide that under various forms of busytalking and commends like the above.<p>The (non) value of her commends is not disputable as I am not the only person that sees that and despite the &quot;rigor&quot; she misses obvious bugs (I left some in in the latest PR just to make sure).<p>So all in all she&#x27;s a no-value PITA.<p>How do you deal with similar cases? What do you suggest?",
