      "text": "I&#x27;ve been applying to full stack and backend engineer jobs for a week or week and a half and noticed that it&#x27;s common for recruiters to ask about experience, describe a role, ask if you have any questions, and then list out next steps of either sending an online technical test, setting up a 30-60 minute coding test phone call with an engineer, or a similar step, only to never message you again after the call is over.<p>What percentage of the time is this to be expected? I assume sometimes it means they didn&#x27;t like what you said during the screen, sometimes it means the engineering manager didn&#x27;t like your resume or wanted to interview another candidate over you, and sometimes they just forgot about you &#x2F; had other priorities.<p>I&#x27;m trying to determine if I should just chalk this up to a normal attrition rate of the interview stages or if its a sign I&#x27;m doing something wrong with my resume or my answers during the initial 15-30 min non-technical interview.",
