Everything I update grub and reboot I cannot re-connected via ssh. Also EC2 console fails to get good status.<p>My config:<p>Ubuntu 20.04 stock AWS AMI x86 64-bit\ni3.metal (spot)<p>Less importantly but also of interest on IOMMU:<p>If one is on bare metal is IOMMU really needed? Seems like not if one is not using HVM. Unsafe IOMMU mode could work<p>Is there any performance advantages to IOMMU? Again as far as I can see, no.",
