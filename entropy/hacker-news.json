      "text": "I was recently told I could not fill a position at a bank as a software developer since I do not have experience in the banking industry. I&#x27;ve worked for streaming services and have plenty experience making web apps and enough in DevOps which are the two areas the CTO spoke to me about.<p>The CTO of said bank (mind you this is a small bank in a small country) approached me to take this position but it was the owner that made the above decision not to take me.<p>Apparently the CTO is pushing for me internally still but what I can do to get my foot in the door with banking experience? Is there some standard background knowledge unique to banking software in particular I could study? I may be wrong but I assume writing software would be the same at a bank except don&#x27;t &quot;move fast and break things&quot; and an emphasis on protecting private information and security. Other than that the knowledge to take requirements and translate them into features&#x2F;projects would be the core of any software position.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate to learn where my assumptions are wrong and then what I could learn about software development for banks, or perhaps just info about the industry in general if you have any interesting material you recommend I read.<p>Thank you.",
