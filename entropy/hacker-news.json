      "text": "I do almost all of my dev work in GitHub codespaces, and I thought I’d be able to use it just fine on an iPad Pro, which would be a convenient laptop replacement for vacationing. But it doesn’t really work that well.<p>1) The connection with the server is closed every time you switch to a different app, so you have to wait like 10 seconds for the site to reconnect when you switch back.<p>2) Unlike VSCode, even if you use a non-standard keyboard layout, all the keyboard shortcuts assume QWERTY. So when pressing cmd-shift-p, you have to actually press where p would be on a qwerty keyboard, which totally messes up my muscle memory.<p>3) The iPad has this really useful feature where a password bar appears at the bottom of the screen when you’re in a password field, which you can use to quickly open your password manager. Unfortunately, this bar is permanently visible whenever you’re in a text field in Codespaces, and it covers up the whole bottom 5% of the screen even if that’s where you’re typing. When you have the integrated terminal open, you’re almost always typing at the bottom of the screen, so it’s impossible to see the command you’re typing.<p>I’m kind of disappointed, but these three things make codespaces next to unusable for me on my iPad.",
