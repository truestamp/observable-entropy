      "text": "Hey everyone!<p>I&#x27;m a long-time reader, first-time poster. I built a tool to help you easily write SQL by building queries visually.<p>I did this because (a) I used to write a lot of SQL in an old job and (b) my girlfriend now needs to write SQL for her job and she&#x27;s very new to it. So if you write a lot of SQL for work (or help people that need to write their own SQL), check it out! I built this over a weekend, so there are some rough edges, but you can try it out without needing to sign up or integrate with any databases. There&#x27;s also a 3 minute demo on the home screen.<p>Link: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craftsql.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;craftsql.com&#x2F;</a><p>Does this generate the most performance optimized queries? The built queries target correctness, not performance. In practice, when I compared generated queries to the ones I wrote by hand, the query planner yields the same plan anyway.<p>Is this a data security risk? No, it never integrates with your actual database, so your data is never exposed. All you need to do is tell it what your tables&#x27; names and columns are, and those are only stored in your browsers local storage.<p>Would love all your thoughts!",
