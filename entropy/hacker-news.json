      "text": "I was reading Jay Caspian King in the New York Times today (&quot;Email Is Slow and Creates Distance. That’s Why It’s Great&quot;)[1]. The piece is about when email was used more often for lengthy personal correspondence (i.e., writing &#x27;letters&#x27;). I came across this paragraph:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nI have one piece of advice for anyone who wants to return to the old days of email: Set up a separate account for all of your lengthy correspondences and check it about once every two or three days. This, more or less, is the relationship I have with the emails I receive from the readers of this newsletter. As I mentioned in last week’s edition, my reader email address has resulted in dozens of meaningful exchanges, the sort of stuff I rarely find on social media\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Does anyone do anything like this? How did it work?<p>[1]:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;email-slack-technology.html",
