      "text": "I&#x27;m in the situation where (I believe) I have system which solves important problems in a tech sector where it is unfeasible, or at least far less practical and resource efficient, that I attempt to build this business from scratch rather than working with established players.<p>The two classic issues:<p>How does one go about effectively &#x27;pitching&#x27;? What are tips for getting in contact with the right people and enticing them?<p>And how does one go about the above without giving away enough information about the proposal to simply jot down, hire the relevant experts, and execute as if the idea is their own? Are patents the only way?<p>Not interested in the diminutive &quot;everyone has a good idea...&quot; response. You can go ahead and assume I&#x27;ve got a plan worth selling; if I was looking for feedback on the idea I&#x27;d share it, but as you can gather from my questions I won&#x27;t be. Thank you.",
