Your CI pipeline is fragile and seems non-deterministic.<p>It feels like there&#x27;s a business opportunity here to somehow connect the people who know with the people (like me) who are willing to pay for an hour or two of a proper expert&#x27;s time.<p>In my most recent case, I have a pihole with cloudflared dns-over-https, and I get frequent rejections.  Nobody likes being rejected, especially when it means your network is useless 25% of the time.  But web searches lead nowhere.  I would pay for proper help, but there&#x27;s no obvious service to match the experts with the clients.<p>Is there one?  If not, is there interest to build such a matchmaking service?",
