      "text": "It&#x27;s obviously won&#x27;t work for everyone, but after being thoroughly frustrated with Strapi CMS last night, I realized I could write a few lambdas. With API gateway you can serve the lambda response directly, so I basically upload assets to S3, and have my first lambda return a list of those assets, and provide secondary links to access them. Then I have a couple of lambdas which will either return json data or binary assets ( signed urls so the objects aren&#x27;t public ) depending on what type of asset I&#x27;m trying to get back.<p>It was like an eureka moment when I realized I could vastly simplify my workflow by doing this, my only concern right now is this simply won&#x27;t scale. Listing hundreds of AWS bucket items does not sound like a fun time, but before I get to that I can always add something like a dynamodb table which keeps track of the items for me.<p>I highly recommend this approach if you&#x27;re developing something like a video game and you need a quick and dirty backend for prototyping. For my project I should be the only user who actually needs to upload data, so just dropping the files directly on S3 works extremely well. I can also add a basic front end to upload the files to S3 if needed.",
