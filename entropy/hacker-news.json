      "text": "HN Community,<p>I found booking.com have shown different price for me and my friend, as a higher level booking.com user, the price I have is $10 higher (10% mark up) than my friend. I am still using the app to book hotels. I think this probably happens in all apps. What&#x27;s a viable solution for end users? Always book with unregistered users and have a compare website for hotels? I know this is not a technical question, but it opens up a space for a new app. TripAdvisor probably is fine since it displays different prices from a few providers.<p>What do you all think? Targeted pricing is reality now.",
