      "text": "Hi HN!<p>2 days ago we received an email that YC will interview us in 2 weeks! We are super stoked, and of course quite nervous :)<p>I am looking for any tips, advice, guidance, and generally any information that you would think we would find helpful! Please comment below or reach out to the email in my profile. Also, if anyone&#x27;s available for doing mock interviews please comment below and I will reach out to you ASAP! In case you&#x27;re aware of any Slack groups that exist for this purpose, please send and invite or recommend the group, it will be much appreciated.<p>About us, we are a hard tech startup doing Central Bank Digital Currency that works completely offline, and its based on smartcards. Lots of jargon, but the simplest way to explain this is that we make debit cards that work completely offline, this means that even the terminals never need to be connected to the internet or GSM or any other network. You can also explain our product as being Digital Cash. Our customers are Central Banks globally, and other companies that work with Central Banks as gov contractors. Our main competition is a multi-billion dollar corporation that prints traditional banknotes for Central Banks, they also have a similar product. Our big vision is that in the future we can become alternatives to VISA and Mastercard, except we are completely privacy-friendly, and there&#x27;s no fees per transaction. We have a great founder team, and a great advisor and investor team, quite well known in the industry.<p>Thanks for reading this, and if you&#x27;re in the same boat good luck with the interview!",
