      "text": "A friend of mine has taken over a legacy (20+ years) 100+ microservices application. And it is an absolute nightmare. The complexity of building and deploying it is the worst I have ever seen. 10x worse than then worst monolith I have ever worked with. Debugging is a nightmare. Synchronisation issues makes auto testing almost impossible. The only good thing is that all the microservices are written in the same programming language. Imagine if 5+ different languages and build systems were used instead? The complexity would have been out of this world.<p>What is your nightmare experience with microservices?",
