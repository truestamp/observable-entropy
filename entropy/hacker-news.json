My app, at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coinship.pro, takes crypto for USPS (soon worldwide) shipping, via 3rd party API at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goshippo.com.<p>Can you recommend features the app needs? I&#x27;m also interested in partnering with a marketing specialist, and possibly another developer, if you want to work on the app significantly. The Shippo API has dozens of carriers worldwide. It has no revenue as yet. I&#x27;m not sure where to go from here. Thank you.",
