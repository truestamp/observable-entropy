      "text": "It might sound silly but in the last few days that I was searching for a job I noticed that I have been asked some strange questions which did not make sense at least to me and because it happened in a few of them I started to think it might be a pattern or some kind of technique.<p>For example one of them asked my &quot;How can you print number 4 without using numbers or strings?&quot; Turns out the answer was &quot;Make array of 4 elements and print its length!<p>Just the other day I was shown a JSON file with a few objects then the interviewer asked me &quot;How would you put this object into a mongoDB document&quot;? The answer was that I should use the &#x27;builder&#x27; pattern to do it.<p>Then I thought maybe those questions are being asked for other purposes than technical reasons or maybe I&#x27;m just hallucinating, Something like this ever happened to you?",
