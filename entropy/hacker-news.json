      "text": "Normally I rarely write my own opinion on things but this just has to come out now. The other day I participated in a Cloud Meetup in my area, since ages again in even in-person. How could it be otherwise, many of the participants have a DevOps background. But the variations in job titles really amazed me.<p>I feel like the term DevOps is becoming inflationary. Sometimes I feel like many people forget what DevOps is all about. It is not a job title that you print on a business card, it is not a department within a company that you can create and then you have automatically established DevOps principles, no DevOps is a culture that must be lived.<p>In the two hours of the Meetup I got to know more of the xOps variations than I would have liked, including FinOps, GreenOps, SecOps and many more.  Is this a trend to combine various areas with DevOps and invent new words?  Where will this lead us, will every area that has contact points between development and operations now be given a new name? ComplianceOps, PeopleOps? I don&#x27;t think they are doing themselves any favors.",
