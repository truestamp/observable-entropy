      "text": "I work as a Paramedic for a large regional ambulance service in the UK. Too many of the calls we attend to with blue lights are not emergencies. This is a problem because it puts genuine emergencies at risk due to long waits and degrades staff morale. The long waits are a national crisis. Yesterday I attended to someone on the floor for 5+hrs before we picked her up.<p>There are many factors to this but I would like to identify the issue of defensive medicine. Defensive medicine refers to the practice of recommending a diagnostic test or medical treatment that is not necessarily the best option for the patient, but mainly serves to protect the clinicians.<p>I believe this is happening with out national medical advice line &#x27;111&#x27;. It is a common held belief amongst my colleagues that &#x27;111&#x27; is too risk adverse.<p>It&#x27;s a long shot asking HN but can one implement a smarter triage system? One that filters out the junk so ambulances are kept for real emergencies.",

We&#x27;re the creators of Sieve API (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sievedata.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sievedata.com</a>) and we recently built this fun site that folks can play around with. Frontend is built with NextJS + Tailwind UI and backend is our API.<p>It uses ffmpeg in the browser to transcode an uploaded video, chop it to 5 seconds, and then send it to our API endpoint which detects and tracks objects in the video. You can then &quot;select&quot; any object and track it over the video.<p>We thought it&#x27;d be a fun thing for the community to play around with while also showing the power of video object tracking!",
