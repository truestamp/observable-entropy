      "text": "Besides the annoyance from all the recruiter spam, I&#x27;m also &quot;worried&quot; about the abysmal productivity of the average recruiter.<p>When I get contacted by headhunters I can&#x27;t count the number of times where I had to exchange 5, 6, 7 messages... to get maybe 20% of what&#x27;s on the real public job posting on the company&#x27;s website(and on top of that sometimes they give me incorrect information!), just to end up telling them that I&#x27;m not interested. Surely they can do better than that?<p>I can&#x27;t count how many times I got contacted for on-sites jobs when I only do full remote, for expert java jobs when I do JS, for senior roles when I&#x27;m a junior.(and some of those people were unicorns internal recruiters!!!)<p>How do these people stay in business?<p>How would put them out of business?(or help them act less stupid, but I doubt that&#x27;s possible)",
