      "text": "for me this is just a job that pays well enough to keep me doing it. If I compare it to let&#x27;s say arts&#x2F;music people are actually passionate about their careers. They go to exhibitions&#x2F;concerts, they go to conferences and passionately network with peers. They are fascinated by others&#x27; work and get inspired for their own and in general can proudly define themselves as artists or musicians. I mean you will never hear some programmer talk passionately about their daily work but you will always hear it with artists.<p>On the other hand I can&#x27;t think of anyone I know in our industry who is not depressed and&#x2F;or pissed off all the time and doesn&#x27;t do this job just because it pays well and is comfortable. The typical image of a software dev I have is a 30+ grumpy white dude who isn&#x27;t taking care of himself and is strongly opinionated about whatever he does while hiding how depressed and bored he is.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in quite a few places big and small and barely if anyone is going to conferences, admiring other programmers, is in communities that admire each others&#x27; work and is genuinely passionate about software. Maybe the AI&#x2F;ML guys seem to be more into what they do than the average dev but that&#x27;s as far as it goes.",
