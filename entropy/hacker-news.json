      "text": "https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.knowforwork.com&#x2F;<p>I am looking for people that run businesses that want to try a new way to grow their paying customers.  I built a referral marketing platform that uses vouchers to attract new paying customers.  The idea is for each referral someone makes, they get a voucher and so does the person being referred.<p>Let say your product is $100 and you give a $10 off voucher.  If someone refers their friend to your product&#x2F;service, both of them gets to buy your product&#x2F;service for $90.  You are earning less per person, but as a whole, you now have 1 more customer that can pay $180.<p>I am targeting businesses that can sell their product&#x2F;service as a package.  We help manage your vouchers and we don&#x27;t restrict you on how your customers purchase. It&#x27;s entirely up to you how those vouchers are used.  The platform is free to use.  If you want to try it out, just fill out this form (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.knowforwork.com&#x2F;list-company).<p>You can also check out our app on\niOS: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;know-for-work&#x2F;id1576175034\nAndroid: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.knowforwork.app",
