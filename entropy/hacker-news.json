Some of these have 2FA. If I&#x27;m incapacitated, or if my house burns down, or some other disaster happens, I want to make sure I (or my successor) can get back into everything as easily as possible. What are people in a similar situation doing? Is keeping the password manager recovery kit in a safe deposit box enough?",
