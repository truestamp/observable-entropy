      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>I&#x27;ve been searching for a solution for a while but either my queries are wildly incorrect or nobody else asked about this before.<p>On Windows, with Thunderbird, when I send or reply to an email I can edit my &quot;sender address&quot; to whatever I want, and considering I have a catch all address I usually reply with the same email address that received the email. Is this not doable on the Mail app?<p>Example: I have a main address firstname@example.com configured in the Mail app Account Settings, and a catch all on *@domain.com configured on the postmaster level.<p>Random website contact me at website@example.com, but if I try to reply to that mail, it will automatically switch the email I&#x27;m writing from to the only saved address it has, so firstname@example.com.<p>Is there any way to reply from a custom address each time without having to add them all in Account Settings? This is specifically for the Mail app on macOS.<p>Thanks",
