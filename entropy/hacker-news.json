      "text": "I like to think I&#x27;ve sussed this Internet thing out. Bookmarks accumulate in several browsers, I export them to HTML format at the end of the year, then I organize them into tidy categories for casual perusal and for leisure time. My collection is highly personal and I don&#x27;t share it with anyone because it&#x27;s sort of like an extension of my mind. This is why I refuse to use a cloud service to store my bookmarks. Anyway, privacy issues aside: How do you deal with the barrage of URLs coming at you from various sources (Hackernews, Pinboard, Link Aggregators, plain search engine queries, etc). Again: I like to think I have this under control by organizing links yearly, but there&#x27;s endless rabbit holes still unobserved and unexplored. I feel there&#x27;s only so much one human can digest, and assimilate, &amp; regardless of how much curation takes place. So what tactics are you people using to make sense of all this information?",
