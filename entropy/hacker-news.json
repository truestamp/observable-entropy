There are many VoIP providers, but the vast majority  of those phone numbers are either blocked completely by most services or can&#x27;t receive short code sms.<p>Does anyone know of a reliable option of getting a phone number that would work over internet, while appearing as a &quot;real&quot; phone number, most importantly not showing up as a voip number and being able to receive the short code sms?",
