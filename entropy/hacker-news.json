      "text": "I&#x27;m over 7 years Adobe CC subscriber (All apps) and I&#x27;m looking for proper alternative from various reasons.<p>1. Price. My income is very unstable last year and it will probably not change with current inflation, energetic craziness and refugee crisis in my country.\n2. I really want to leave Windows and stay completely on Linux.\n3. Especially for photo-catalogue I don&#x27;t want be limited by one software in future.<p>Honestly I have no problem to work with Adobe products. They are really good, stable since 2018, dynamic link is very useful and I&#x27;m used to work with. But... They do not have competition. I&#x27;m regularly use Photoshop (advanced photo editing, drawing), Premiere (video production), After Effects (basic animations, motion graphic), InDesign (print work), Lightroom Classic (pro photo editing and management), Audition (audio editing for video and podcasts) and occasionally Illustrator (vector graphic).<p>Please, are there any professionals, that switched from Adobe and share experience from professional production? Thanks.",
