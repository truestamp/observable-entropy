      "text": "I know that a lot of people on HN are focused on retiring as early as possible. However, for a variety of reasons (some within my control and some not) it seems unlikely that I will ever be able to afford a comfortable retirement despite my efforts to save. I&#x27;ve heard from others in my peer group that they are in the same boat.<p>Let&#x27;s say that I am in my 30s now, reasonably healthy both mentally and physically, and want to take steps that will allow me to continue working in a technical field for as long as possible (40+ years) so that I can maintain my income well into old age.<p>What are some things I should start doing now and&#x2F;or think about doing in the future that will allow me to stay &quot;on my game&quot; in terms of being able to work and earn a living?",
