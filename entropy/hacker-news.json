      "text": "Hey Hackers,<p>A desperate call for feedback here.<p>I must be doing something utterly wrong.<p>After working for 5+ years in tech recruitment and having built a profitable company in the space generating $1M+ ARR - I finally admit that I know nothing about this market.<p>For the last 2 months I and my co-founder have been working on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenlight.jobs&#x2F;employers&#x2F; - a marketplace that connects businesses with vetted overseas engineers looking for remote work opportunities. It is a &#x27;reverse&#x27; job marketplace, where &#x27;poachable&#x27; candidates list their anonymized profiles. As a result, employers see available candidates immediately - which shortens time-to-hire many times. It also gives businesses access to the new and huge &#x27;hidden&#x27; pool of talent.<p>I had great faith in this idea for at least 3 reasons:\n1) Post-COVID, hiring engineers became even tougher than before. \n2) Remote becomes the new normal - and consequently international hiring is on the rise, with companies like Deel or Remote - that provide paperwork and payroll for foreign employees, surpassing billion-dollar valuations;\n3) There are tens of thousands of brilliant engineers on local markets that speak decent English, and are happy to work for an American startup for $100K-120K + equity.<p>We have seen a lot of entusiasm from candidates - and quickly got a strong first batch of senior React+Node full-stack developers.<p>However after we launched the employers website - the interest turned to be surprisingly low. We got only 4 job postings so far, 1 from last weeks&#x27; Show HN (4 upvotes, 3 comments) and 3 from Bookface. \nToday Greenlight launched on Product Hunt - and got only 29 upvotes so far.<p>I strongly believe in the vision of work knowing no borders on the future - so don&#x27;t want to give up on this easily. \nI would therefore be grateful for any piece of feedback that would help me understand what may we be missing.<p>Thanks!",
