      "text": "Another month, another &quot;who&#x27;s hiring&quot;.<p>Most entries do not include salary info.  So we go to glassdoor (or somewhere better?).  Even still, maybe we don&#x27;t find any or reliable&#x2F;believable info.<p>Now we as candidates have to decide: do we take the time to start the conversation with the company, only to find out after some time and effort that the salary is way below our current appropriate range?<p>And on the company side, they have to sift through tons of intro emails and possibly resumes to decide whom to respond to.<p>What is the time cost of the involved parties on both sides?  (Hint: it&#x27;s a lot.)<p>So stop wasting everyone&#x27;s time.  State your &quot;typical&quot; salary number.  Maybe it&#x27;s a bit higher or lower than what a candidate might secure, but at least it will help with initial alignment.",
