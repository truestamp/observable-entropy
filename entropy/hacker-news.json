      "text": "Bonjour HN!<p>I lead the product efforts at DSLA Protocol, a peer-to-peer third-party risk management infrastructure for developers and their communities.<p>tl;dr I wanted to share news about our ongoing hackathon and ways to get started!<p>DSLA Protocol lets anyone manufacture and package their own insurance, or add insurance to any existing product and service offerings. Within hours.<p>Like a factory, but for customer protection and service differentiation.<p>We designed DSLA Protocol as a decentralised alternative to service-level agreements (SLA).<p>Instead of using offline legal documents with a lot of intermediaries and poor capital efficiency, service-level agreements become:<p>‣ parametric: service-level agreements are enforced based on performance parameters sourced from third-party analytics<p>‣ programmable: anyone can source any performance parameter, and develop any type of service-level agreements<p>‣ peer-to-peer: anyone can deploy, monitor and enforce service-level agreements without intermediaries<p>‣ collateralised: Anyone can stake cryptocurrency to predict the evolution of performance parameters and hedge against risk<p>Now...<p>We are currently co-organising the #DubaiDeFi Web 3.0 hackathon with up $300K in prizes.<p>DSLA Protocol is contributing more than $100K in DSLA tokens to the pool:<p>1st Place:\n50K USD in $DSLA<p>2nd Place:\n25K USD in $DSLA<p>3rd Place:\n10K USD in $DSLA<p>Interested in participating?<p>The deadline is November 26, midnight GMT.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that:<p>‣ All accepted hackathon submissions entitle their developer(s) to $1K<p>‣ All participants can top up their rewards with an extra $25K community prize<p>‣ The best projects will provide a long-term revenue stream to its developer(s)<p>If you develop a new type of service-level agreement, and it is added to the protocol, you will collect fees every time the agreement is verified. Forever.<p>How to participate?<p>Fast way:<p>1&#x2F; Download the example DSLA Oracle serverless:<p>‣ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Stacktical&#x2F;stacktical-dsla-oracle-se<p>2&#x2F; Implement your DSLA Oracle serverless:<p>‣ It must be able to select third party analytics data by consuming public API endpoints<p>‣ It must be able to select hourly&#x2F;daily&#x2F;weekly&#x2F;bi-weekly&#x2F;monthly&#x2F;yearly analytics<p>‣ It must return a percentage, representing the service performance for the selected period<p>3&#x2F; Create a Github repository, commit and push your code, then submit your repository to founders+hackathon@stacktical.com<p>Strong way:<p>Follow the instructions we share in this blog post https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.stacktical.com&#x2F;mainnet&#x2F;dev&#x2F;2021&#x2F;11&#x2F;15&#x2F;stacktical-dsla-protocol-dtk-developer-toolkit-getting-started-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html then follow the steps described in .<p>This step will require you to roll out the full DSLA Protocol stack on your computer, live code the DSLA Oracle serverless, and validate your developments using the DSLA Developer Toolkit CLI commands (DTK).<p>Whether you go fast or strong,<p>‣ Find an example of performance risk you can measure<p>‣ Use the DSLA Oracle serverless to source measurements<p>‣ Return a percentage to DSLA smart contracts through Chainlink<p>Technical support and more information<p>Join the #hackathon-dubaidefi channel of our Discord server:<p>‣ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;dXYNmkENyx<p>Official hackathon website:<p>‣ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dubaidefi.io&#x2F;<p>DSLA Developer Toolkit CLI Github<p>‣ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Stacktical&#x2F;stacktical-dsla-developer-toolkit<p>DSLA Protocol Developer Guide<p>‣ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;readme.stacktical.com&#x2F;developer-guide&#x2F;<p>DSLA Protocol Community Telegram<p>‣ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;stacktical<p>DSLA Network Support Telegram<p>‣ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;dsla_network<p>My team and I will also be available here to answer your questions!<p>Good luck to all,<p>Cheers,<p>Wilhem",
