      "text": "I had my first computer 34 years ago. I have used keyboards since then and I developed my own way of semi-blind quasi-8 finger typing. However, this requires me to take a look at the keyboard frequently, because I keep moving my hands all over the place on the keyboard, and it is also far from being error-free. I&#x27;ve entertained the thought of learning touch typing for a while. I am about to take a break from work, so I may be able to tolerate some temporary typing speed decrease while learning&#x2F;practicing. What methods&#x2F;software&#x2F;etc. do you recommend me to learn?",
