      "text": "Hi, I am the founder of a blog&#x2F;e-commerce store and I am looking to scale my efforts with a very limit budget - $2000-$3000 roughly.<p>It&#x27;s in the preparedness niche - a high-paying niche me and a friend are personally invested in. I receive anywhere from 15,000 to 30,000 visitors a month - it&#x27;s somewhat seasonal. My social media following is around 20,000 - most on Facebook.<p>I am outsourcing&#x2F;delegating some of the non-executive work and we are using a couple of paid tools, PPC&#x2F;Facebook ads, along with hosting.<p>Our income streams are diverse - we receive a monthly paycheck from Ezoic and Amazon Affiliates. We also just started sponsored posts and backlink sales. Additionally, we just started drop shipping and we&#x27;re getting some on and off results from there.<p>If you were in my shoes, what steps would you take to scale it on a major scale?",
