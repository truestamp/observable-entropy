      "text": "Hello fellow HN users,<p>I expect to start a job soon where the main backend language is Python, with parts of Ruby and RoR in the stack. I have been a Ruby dev and have a beginner-level familiarity with Python - having read more than written.<p>How should I go about increasing my competency in the language to a decent level as fast as possible. I am talking about general fluency and knowledge about Python and not specific to the tech stack of the company.<p>I am sure there are excellent Python devs here and also devs who had to ramp up on the language for their job. As such, I thought I should get some guidance from the community.<p>Appreciate all opinions and pointers!",
