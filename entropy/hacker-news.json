I am a noob at frontend changes and my state switches from despondency to regret at having left my big tech job, and at times brief hope when I make some progress before I inevitably get stuck.<p>For people who have dabbled in both, is it smart to endure and gain competency in frontend (react, redux etc) or should I try to stick with backend with the occasional frontend task that keeps me growing but not despondent hopefully. Ultimately, I want to grow in the management track whenever I get there.",
