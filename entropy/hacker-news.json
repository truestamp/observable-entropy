      "text": "[Received today by email]<p>We’re writing to notify you of an upcoming change to Amazon.co.uk.<p>Starting 19 January, 2022, we will unfortunately no longer accept Visa credit cards issued in the UK, due to the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions. You can still use debit cards (including Visa debit cards) and non-Visa credit cards like Mastercard, Amex, and Eurocard to make purchases. Please update your default payment method now, or add one of these new, eligible payment methods if you do not have one.<p>You can update your Prime membership here, and if you have any subscriptions on Amazon.co.uk, you can update them on the &#x27;&#x27;manage your subscription&#x27;&#x27; page here.<p>We know this may be inconvenient, and we’re here to help you through this transition so you can continue enjoying Amazon’s low prices and wide selection. Please visit this help page for more information on payment methods, or go directly to your account.",
