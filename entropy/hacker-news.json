So we&#x27;ve built a platform for creators to create a website and offer direct engagement to their follower base.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of the profile: www.trycasa.app&#x2F;dhruv<p>Would be great to get some of you signed up at www.trycasa.app for feedback. This is useful for the following group:<p>-Artists who are looking to monetise their followers<p>-Developers looking to freelance or teach directly to their network.<p>-Sales&#x2F;Marketing folks looking to help small businesses grow.<p>-3D freelancers that are looking to engage directly with their following or grow it.<p>-Anyone that is trying to become their own business and easily create a platform for themselves.",
