I use an ad blocker. I will still need my 2 i7s for work but I&#x27;m sold. If I&#x27;m browsing the web to relax I&#x27;m using a Chromebook from now on.<p>I know most people think of them as less than great but both windows and OSX have gotten so blotted that it slows down even the fastest CPU. Google has done a great job at optimizing the code to work well with low end CPUs. Both Apple and Microsoft should learn from it and create a web only OS.",
