      "text": "When you are bootstrapping a startup, and you first start making money, it&#x27;s straightforward advice to put “the money back into the startup.” It shows commitment to grow, they say.<p>I found it to be precisely the opposite. For me, I decided to take the first thousand dollars and paid myself.<p>The reason was this:<p>When I started, my big goal was to get to a modest couple of thousand dollars of recurring revenue per month. Probably enough to match my salary and quit my day job. That goal, amongst creating a great product that people used, charged me up, and kept me going. When I achieved it, there was a great sense of relief. And the monthly recurring revenue kept growing past my goal, and the spirit of assistance turned into confidence.<p>I didn’t like that.<p>I needed that goal back again. I need the feeling of the climb from zero to 2–3k back again.<p>So I made it that. I took the money away from the company and paid myself. So I better build the recurring revenue back up again.<p>I know this is pretty silly, even stupid but anything to keep the interest going in the beginning stages.<p>Startups fail not because of a lack of money, but because the founders quit. They lose interest, drive, challenge, and accept defeat. It has happened to me many times before. Not that I would have stopped this time around, but it’s fun to have a laser beam to chase.<p>Keeping the heart in the business is more important than saving money.\nThe author is the founder of Proxies API(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;), a proxy rotation API service.\nThis article originally appeared here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;I-Didn%E2%80%99t-Put-My-Earnings-Back-Into-My-Startup-Here%E2%80%99s-Why..php",
