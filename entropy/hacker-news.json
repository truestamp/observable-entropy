      "text": "The Western democracies seem fairly serious about imposing serious economic sanctions on Russia. The Russian government is responding with the equivalent of capital controls, to prop up its currency and limit the possibility of panic and bank runs. It seems likely that Russians will, for awhile, try to circumvent some of those sanctions by using cryptocurrencies. For instance, a Russian citizen, if they think the ruble will lose more value than it already has, might try to trade rubles for a cryptocurrency, right now. How would the Western democracies respond to that? Will we see greater efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies?",
