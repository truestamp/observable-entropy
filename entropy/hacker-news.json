      "text": "Hello HN,<p>Over the last year, we’ve been building Glancy [0], a consumer-focused messaging platform that lays out video messages into the traditional text messaging format. Our goal is to make video messaging easier and more engaging than text messaging, while keeping all the unique benefits of text as well.<p>Glancy is opinionated in a few ways:<p><i>No Preview and No Replay</i> - When you tap to start a video message, we start recording right away. No preview screen to fix your hair, and no replay of the video before sending. Removing the ability to self-edit allows us to capture more nuance, and allows the user to speak as if they were having an in-person conversation. It also significantly lowers the effort to send a message.<p><i>Automatic Recording</i> - When someone receives a video message and watches it, we automatically flip on the camera and start recording a response. This simulates the back and forth of in-person conversations and yields responses that are far more genuine and authentic as they are captured in the moment.<p><i>Optional Reaction Videos</i> - When sharing media (photos for now, video support coming) you have the option to require recipients to record their reaction while consuming the media. If you send your mom photos of your child wearing that sweater she got them, you’ll automatically receive a video message of your mom scrolling through the photos one by one with her video reaction synced with what she’s seeing.<p>For #1 and #2, you can always cancel and stop the camera. For #3, you get prompted with a warning letting you know you’ll be recorded if you continue to consume the media.<p>As with any young app, it’s a work in progress. We hope to continue evolving how we stay in touch with one another. E2EE isn&#x27;t implemented yet, but it&#x27;s high on our priority list. It’s now available for iOS [1] in the US&#x2F;Canada.<p>Happy to receive any feedback or to answer any questions.<p>Ellery, Founder<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glancy.io\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;install.glancy.io&#x2F;hn",
