      "text": "I run Linux, uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Decentraleyes, and ClearURLs. I also use a Pi-hole. I primarily use Chromium, but also Chrome and Firefox on occasion. In the last week or so, I&#x27;ve noticed a severe uptick in the amount of ads slipping through the cracks. I&#x27;ve verfied uBlock is working, up to date, and verified my traffic is passing through the Pi-hole. I&#x27;ve ensured the Pi-hole is working as regards FTL, blocklist subs up to date. I use Cloudflare for DNS so I don&#x27;t think there are any DNS injections. Is Manifest V3 the culprit? At first I thought it was, but Firefox is seeing the same results. Any ideas?",
