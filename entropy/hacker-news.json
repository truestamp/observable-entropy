      "text": "I work for a company that has a few large accounts say 20 and each of these have settings that are kept in a db.<p>These settings are only updated a few times a year or when we add a new account. We currently use a script to update the settings but feels like this is the wrong approach. I&#x27;d much prefer a declarative model. We use terraform to manage our infrastructure and something like that would be ideal but it looks like writing a custom provider is a fair amount of work, or at least more than I was hoping for.<p>Anyone have any suggestions on a better approach?",

I&#x27;m curious to see if anyone had a BrandonM moment in their life.<p>For example, maybe you were choosing between working at two startups and made the &quot;wrong&quot; choice. Maybe you had the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin early but didn&#x27;t take the chance. Maybe you had the opportunity to decide which tech stack to use at a company and made the suboptimal call.<p>Have you ever held a strong opinion which turned out to be completely wrong.<p>1. What was it?<p>2. What was the result?<p>3. Does it haunt you to this day?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9224",
