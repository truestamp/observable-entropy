      "text": "To protect the innocent&#x2F;guilty, I won&#x27;t name the company here.<p>1. Need a data source, which previously was open for commercial use, for one of my MVP features<p>2. After a merger, company now offers a &quot;no-cost&quot; license to use so long as proper attribution is given and brief approval process is completed. Have been talking with them off&#x2F;on multiple times for 12 months to gain access. Seems I am too small a company for them to really pay attention to regardless of their public statements re: access. I have even asked them to come up with a &quot;per api call&quot; fee that was fair to both parties (until I can get bigger and pay their ~$5K average minimum fee) but no luck so far.<p>3. Came across an academic study on github which used this company&#x27;s data from 1 year ago.<p>Am I allowed to use the old data set for my internal research and commercial purposes? I only want to do the right thing.<p>Thanks in advance!",
