      "text": "Right now I am struggling with few problems, I am not sure, if someone can relate. But, I am throwing this out for some help and guidance.<p>- My daily drive to be productive is down the drain. I just don&#x27;t feel like working\n- I don&#x27;t have a lot of work pressure, deadlines are comfortable, and I am meeting everything\n- I am in a great job, I have recently switched careers and I am feeling great about it. So no snags there.<p>The problem<p>- I just don&#x27;t feel like working at all, like lazing around, doing nothing, watching TV, sports, and then just make up something and speak it out in the stand up.<p>Just can&#x27;t seem to get out of the rut. Has anyone experienced this, and if so, how did you get out of this?",
