On average, the starting salary of a data entry operator in the US is 28,000 USD&#x2F;year or 15$&#x2F;hour or 0.23$&#x2F;minute. An error correction will take 140 seconds on average to verify an A4-sheet text data or 10-row x 5-column table data that accounts for 0.5$&#x2F;page. While tons of OCR services claim the best accuracy in character recognition, there is no 100% guarantee. For sensitive data systems, maybe in financial or medical data extraction companies, would you prefer to pay 0.5-1$ USD&#x2F;page for a guaranteed 100% accuracy?",
