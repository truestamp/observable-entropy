      "text": "I would like to learn how to pitch projects to potential customers, I have in the past few months seen several places where I feel I could improve or create new services for them that would be of benefit, but I have never pitched to anyone before.<p>Books, resources on pitching projects? I have an oreilly membership and maybe will get pluralsight so if you have suggestions there it would be good.<p>Also I want to do the MVP (minimal viable pitch), I&#x27;m not a great designer, so I would really like to learn to do enough of a pitch to get paid to produce the designs for the idea so I could pay a designer to help with that.<p>At this point it also comes into questions on how to structure payment, what to ask for?",

I used to read papers every day in my previous job, but as I transitioned from academia to industry I have less and less time to do so. Also, while I was working in academia, I felt that a lot of papers were just noise: too incremental, poorly written, dished out fast to get to a conference. What are you top 10 papers that are high quality, an interesting read, and generally worth the time?",
