      "text": "Basically the title. Finished my second year of college, which is a good college but not the best in the country (Top 10 college in country).<p>Now that I&#x27;m done with my 2nd year of undergrad, I&#x27;ve managed to get admission into the best college in the country (by a country mile). No transferring credits though - and I&#x27;ll have just turned 20 when I join (if I join).<p>That&#x27;s pretty much the gist of it - should I leave my Top 10 college for the Number One college? Since I&#x27;m joining at 20, will it be too late? I&#x27;ll be graduating at 24 - do you think it&#x27;s worth it? Will future employers look upon this switch negatively?",
