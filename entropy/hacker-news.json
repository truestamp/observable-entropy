      "text": "Domainy is a tool to get alerted on when the domain names you like and want are about to expire and also become available.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.domainy.io<p>A few use cases<p>- I&#x27;m monitoring all the other TLD domain names for which I would like to eventually acquire to protect brand names for the domain names that I already have (e.g. I have google.com and I want to make sure that I have google.abcde, google.edfg etc etc)<p>- I also want to know when some of the domains that I would like will expire and possibly become available, so I can quickly buy them if I can. Just because a domain is expired, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s available right away. But still, I&#x27;d like to keep my eye on them.<p>- Sometimes, it&#x27;s just super interesting to see when some high profile names are available through obsecure TLDs (e.g. twitter.beauty, twitter.accountant, twitter.dealer domain names are available. What would happen if I buy them and do something with it. Twitter will probably come after me, but hey, it&#x27;s an interesting thought. Maybe they&#x27;ll buy them off? I don&#x27;t know. What other high profile names are available through other TLDs?<p>cheers!",
