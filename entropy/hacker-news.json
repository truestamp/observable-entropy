      "text": "I have been working on a email platform for the last few months, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postheat.com. While building and marketing I did not find much traction with non-technical users. So decided to make a pivot to developers with the addition of an API for transnational email. While working on product market fit I spoke to around 100 developers to learn more about their needs for an email API. Most devs I have spoken to are already using another platform and are not looking to switch due to the cost of code migration (understandably). I have some had some interest from developers with new projects, but I’m still far from product market fit, and I do not yet have much traction.<p>How can I update my email platform in such a way that would compel you to use it for your next project, or even better, migrate away from your existing solution?<p>P.S. The email builder is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postheat.com&#x2F;create",
