      "text": "I use Bash scripts quite a bit for short term &#x27;throw-away&#x27; type projects that may or may not be re-used once a project is over. These projects are mostly automating server and cloud environments.  The re-usable code library has grown and although I&#x27;ve considered re-writing to Python or even Node.js, its hard to justify the investment of resources for the conversion given the flexibility and ubiquity of Bash.<p>I&#x27;ve grown to really like Bash as I can do things in one line using builtins vs a multiple line Python script requiring external libraries. I can also have exact parity with cloud command line interface ( e.g. aws, az, gcloud) features (vs the cloud API libraries).<p>Assuming I stick with Bash for at least the short term, what Bash frameworks have you used and recommend? I&#x27;ve taken a look at Bash infinity but it doesn&#x27;t appear be an active project judging by lack of recent releases. I&#x27;m primarily interested in code-reuse . I&#x27;m already well on my way to building a framework with a node feel, creating an &#x27;app generator&#x27; and pulling in modules from an external privately shared repository.<p>Am I re-inventing the wheel? Does anyone else have any use for something similar?",
