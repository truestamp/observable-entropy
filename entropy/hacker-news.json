If I visit my page I see the lock in the navigation bar of the browser. \nMy surprise was when yesterday a customer sent me a picture of the browser with the text &quot;https&quot; crossed out and in red with a warning &quot;not secure&quot;.<p>Has anyone had a similar problem? any recommendations on how to solve it?",
