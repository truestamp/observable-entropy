And I have never been able to solve a Rubik&#x27;s cube.<p>My question is - can people solve these without any training or knowlegde of tricks or actual methods to solve them? Am I banging my head at the wrong wall? Should I learn about the methodology or is an average person supposed to solve these without any training?",
