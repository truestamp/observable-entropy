      "text": "I&#x27;ve been out of high school for almost 12 years. \nAnd I&#x27;ve never had a job I really loved.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in about 20 different industries from the oilfield to construction to food service, to debt collection, to transportation, to everything in between.  Nothing in tech though.<p>Some were possible &quot;good&quot; jobs, but often they&#x27;re very dangerous. I was an apprentice in a trade that has the potential to earn a lot 5 years in.<p>It&#x27;s like I work for a bit and I&#x27;ll get to a point where I just want to quit and be done with it.  Or there are conditions I just don&#x27;t want to put up with anymore so I just walk.<p>I&#x27;ve never felt content or joy at work, which I think is normal, but I also think some other people enjoy their work.<p>It&#x27;s also part laziness, I can be slothful without a routine.<p>But I just feel so lost. I almost feel too old to keep constantly moving on to something else.<p>Has anybody else been in this situation and come out the other side with meaningful work that they like? And they&#x27;re able to support themselves?<p>Just feel lost, I guess. Thank you.",
