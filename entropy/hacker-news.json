This journey let me read the   CardDAV RFC (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;rfcmarkup?doc=6352).<p>Now I want to practice implementing RFCs, since I hav e never done that before. It looks like the CardDAV one is quite big (?) for the first try.<p>So I wondered: Do you recommend or know a RFC which is easy&#x2F;small to implement so I can get my feet wet?",
