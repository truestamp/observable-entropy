      "text": "Ideally, would love something along the lines of Netscape Navigator browser&#x27;s &quot;Composer&quot; which has been duplicated in SeaMonkey ... but without having to micro-manage things like cell border widths and such.<p>The closest thing found so far is Carrd, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to allow for the flexibility of Composer.<p>Basically, need something that effortlessly allows a &quot;WYSIWYG&quot;-type approach to having a single, static landing page with the ability to add a little bit of text, an image or two initially, and the ability to maybe add more images on the landing page OR have a separate &quot;Partners&quot; page where corporate logos and maybe some contact info for a key person could be added.<p>Pretty much everything so far is overkill, insists on flashy &quot;pre-built templates&quot; that take away from the core presentation and don&#x27;t even allow for the &quot;look-and-feel&quot; desired.<p>At the same time, hiring a web dev, even on outsourcing sites, seems a bit too much PLUS maintaining control of all aspects of the site would be crucial for security purposes.<p>Thought about Facebook or Reddit which WOULD allow for group communications, but have had horrible experiences with both where previous accounts&#x2F;subreddits were banned &quot;by accident&quot; for technical reasons that the companies agreed were in error, and yet have inexplicably failed to be of assistance in retrieving the data lost, despite agreeing that the accounts&#x2F;subreddits were flagged &quot;by mistake&quot; via automated processes they developed but refuse to take responsibility for (&quot;It&#x27;s not OUR fault, &quot;the Ai&quot; did that&quot; ...)<p>Anyone have any ideas?<p>I&#x27;ve looked at &quot;landing page&quot; services, but again it seems like overkill with too many things that have nothing to do with what this project is about, and again most of them seem to have this insistence on dime-a-dozen &quot;templates&quot; that clutter the presentation and have nothing to do with what is actually desired.<p>tl;dr: Looking for a simple WYSIWG web-based service that can (preferably automatically, linked with domain name creation&#x2F;integration&#x2F;management) publish a 1-2 page landing site with the ability to edit minimum text and flexibly add photos of partner companies as they sign up.<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",

      "text": "I purchased 200 $1 solar rechargable garden lights at the dollar store.<p>I placed many about - but have a lot left.<p>They come with an LED, a solar panel, and a 400ma battery (AA sized) (super weak battery) - but they are cool...<p>I have more than I can use, I took a few and opened them up and replaced the AA sized 400ma batt with some other 1200ma&#x27;s and they were super brighter...<p>However.<p>I would like to harvest the parts from these solar lights (specifically the solar charging capability and attach them to a battery array with the solar array to a USB charging port as a way to learn how to do this.<p>Clueless.. I am seeking a mentor on how to do such, and I will send you a number of these devices to unlock yourself, but teach me how to harvest these objects and put them in series? to power &#x2F; charge other devices.<p>-<p>I have a few solar powered battery blocks, but I love the idea of using these little 1.5x1.5 inch solar panels to trickle a battery -- but more flexibly placed on something like a back pack or umbrella...<p>with the goal of teaching this to kids, but in this respect, I am a kid and would like to learn...<p>I don&#x27;t know about creating a new series of either batteries or series of solar panels.<p>(In a backpack, what I would like to do is get a few replacement iPad batteries and have them slotted into a backpack and have the cheapo solar cells charge the ipad batts in the backpack...)<p>I have around 100+ of these $1 garden lights... (I couldnt pass up buying a solar power, a nimh 400ma battery and LED with controller board for $1 each...)<p>But now I am looking to a solution for the problem of having all these devices I want to build something else from.<p>Anyone tinker like this?",
