      "text": "Hopefully this won’t become flame-y, but I have the sense that HN tends to have a predominance of engineers who fit a (admittedly limited in actual meaning) stereotype of white (or maybe South Asian), male, cisgendered. The perception is based partly on posting jobs here and who responded as well as a kind of ambient sense from comment-reading. It’s not a sense that HN is unwelcoming, more just reflective of the general state of things, but I’m curious what other people who don’t fit that stereotype experience here and if there are other spaces that are more diverse that could be good to check out?",
