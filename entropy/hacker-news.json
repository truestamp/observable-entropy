      "text": "I love Notion! We&#x27;ve been using it for a few months at my startup and it&#x27;s completely replaced Jira, Confluence Wiki, and Google Docs. I&#x27;ve also used it to replace my super janky home-rolled &quot;wiki&quot; of Google Docs, and everything feels so much cleaner, discoverable, and organized.<p>Notion&#x27;s primitives (pages, sub-pages, templates, and databases) hit the sweet spot of being customizable while also being usable. There are still some things I would like to change about the UX (shortcuts for all the things!), but overall I&#x27;m a very happy customer.<p>Anyway, just wanted to throw out some support for a product I&#x27;ve been happy with lately. Try it out![1]<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.notion.so&#x2F;",
