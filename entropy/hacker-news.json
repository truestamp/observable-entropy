      "text": "Not sure how much effort i want to put into this, as i’ve already wasted enough time on it, though it might be interesting to web sleuths. Basically, i’m not sure reddit was ever a quality site, but it appears to me it’s been getting crumbier and crumbier with funny tokens and power ups and by my observation poor moderation.
