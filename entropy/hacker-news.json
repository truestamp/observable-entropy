      "text": "I decided to list my business for sale on MicroAcquire. After inputting some of our info, but before I wanted the listing to go live, they emailed me and said they had made my listing live. I thought there was a button to submit the listing before it went live, but they told me it just automatically goes live as soon as you enter all the required info. So I asked them to make the listing non-public, which they did.<p>But then the next morning I got another email saying our listing was live (I hadn&#x27;t done anything). Not only that, but they had added a whole bunch of private info, such as our customers, to the public page!<p>So now I&#x27;ve just edited out the confidential information and asked them to remove our listing. I just can&#x27;t trust them, so I won&#x27;t be using their service.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, as it looked like a useful service. I&#x27;m not concerned that they might sell my data.",

I enjoy it but would just like more free time for projects, hikes, etc. If I could earn 3&#x2F;5ths of my salary for working 3&#x2F;5ths my current time, I&#x27;d take it. Really, I&#x27;d be open 2&#x2F;5th - 4&#x2F;5th or working full time with some extended time off between projects. I&#x27;m not a great networker so not sure freelance would be the easiest option for me but I&#x27;d be open. I&#x27;m just looking for ideas and to hear from others about their experiences.",

As time has gone on we&#x27;ve been fighting with limitations of the platform along with developer experience. I was wondering if anyone here has been in a similar situation and how then went about migrating off of the platform. Ideally this would need to be incremental due to the demands of the business. Taking a pause to do a complete rewrite using the headless API would be hard to justify to the business at the current stage.",
