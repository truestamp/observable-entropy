      "text": "Hi HN:<p>Just reaching out to the community to ask if anyone might be able to throw me a few bucks for food, and possibly other needed basics? At the least I am trying to at least secure food to get me through next week.<p>A few nice people in the community sent me a few bucks, so I am fed until tomorrow, and have some toiletries and new shoes.<p>I&#x27;d like to start programming again. Where I am, which is far from any city, my best path is to get a laptop, a bike, and a coworking membership, then bill time writing software again. I stopped coding years ago, but am sufficiently recharged now.<p>In the immediate term, I am seeking help from the community to fill in the gap for food until my EBT renews early next month. I am entirely unhoused and charge my phone at the library.<p>If you can help, can you email me at hackernewscontactmail g&#x27;mail? I can accept apple cash, paypal, cashapp, or venmo. Plz email me first for usernames, as those accounts do not use that gmail address.<p>I would love to write code as a 1099 now. But, to do so, I truly need someone to throw me a rope so I can climb out of this hole. A lead on a feasible remote gig and a way to obtain the tools needed fulfill the work would be the most ideal form of help. I can try upwork, but need some basics addressed in order to qualify to use their service as a contractor.<p>If you&#x27;d like any more background on me or my situation, or if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact me directly instead of replying here.<p>Very grateful.",
