      "text": "I&#x27;m working on a startup and need to develop a mobile app for it. I do not have any background in mobile development (but have experience as a developer), and was curious about whether I should develop two, separate, native apps, or use a cross-platform, mobile development framework. I am also open to the idea of offering the app as only a mobile website.<p>As far as app features go, my app will most likely need to access location and the camera.<p>So, what is your advice on the best approach and why? Also, is there an approach more suited for someone new to development in this area? I am grateful for any and all feedback!",
