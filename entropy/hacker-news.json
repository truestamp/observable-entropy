      "text": "Is there a line of research that looks into solving difficult &#x2F; intractable problems by finding a mapping that expresses them as different problems that we know how to solve?<p>A fairly surreal and probably overly optimistic example would be, for example, to solve traveling salesman problems using chess engines. What we would need is to find right mappings:\n(1) from a traveling salesman problem to a chess position and,\n(2) from a traveling salesman route to a chess move (or move sequence)<p>A general solution for a &quot;compiler&quot; that can translate between any pair of problems feels unrealistic but I can imagine developing a mapping between, say, a tic tac toe game and simple chess positions where you could:\n(1) translate a tic tac toe position into a chess position\n(2) solve the chess position\n(3) translate the solution into a tic tac toe sequence<p>Any thoughts or pointers to relevant research would be much appreciated!",

However, I just received this email:<p>&gt; The expected change regarding the use of Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on January 19. We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk.  Should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice. Until then, you can continue to use Visa credit cards, debit cards, Mastercard, American Express, and Eurocard as you do today.",
