Chemistry), I feel like I really would like to have the fundamentals of CS down. Doubly so as I would like to go into the field of VR, and right now I&#x27;m working on my own toy rendering engine, which I feel is really exposing my lack of knowledge...<p>Anyways, any suggestions welcome. Ideally it&#x27;d be more digestible than just a plain textbook but I&#x27;m open to anything. I imagine either way it&#x27;ll be a tough but great read to work through :)",
