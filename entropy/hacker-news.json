      "text": "I am a slow and deep learner. I write software 30 years now and changed jobs only twice. Last time I changed from semiconductor to computer network, I romanticized changing industry was just to learn some new libraries, the transition was quite tough, yet I made it successful eventually.<p>Now the company&#x27;s new leadership team is making changes I really hate and I am thinking to change job, given that most job openings are cloud and related, so likely it will be an industry change again.<p>I can see the following options:\n1. Switch career internally. The Product Marketing group has opening and they are in my area. But writing slides daily seems not that interesting.<p>2. My company also has cloud engineering positions, I can apply. But that&#x27;s still under the  same management team of which I hate.<p>3. Just change job to a cloud company and see how it goes. This is the option I think of most, just that my heart sinks when I recall the painful transition 10 years ago.<p>If you have similar experience, can you share?",
