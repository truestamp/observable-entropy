What about assets? Let&#x27;s say we force a redirect to https:&#x2F;&#x2F; on the site itself, but not on assets. e.g. you copy the request and change it to http you can access some javascript files. Would that be a problem?<p>How about API ? Is it neccesary that also api.coolstore.com requires https, even though it&#x27;s only used by the website? Should it have http:&#x2F;&#x2F; completely turned off?<p>Is there some manual of best practices with deploying react site + api ?",
