      "text": "The Premise:<p>As I was browsing the job boards in the EU area, I was faced with several unpleasant realizations. Companies, for the most part, are looking for devs with 2-3 years of experience in a given tech. Having 10+ years of experience in anything is not required and might as well be considered against the applicant. Work is being off-shored to low income countries. Adding to that, stories of ye olde programmers bringing in major dough 15 years or so ago sound like fairy tales today. It would seem coding was reduced to gluing things up from pre-made blocks and is not viewed with awe and respect it once may have had.<p>This all is written from perspective of a senior software dev in Europe. I realize FANG and or devs with extremely niche or trendy skills might not perceive this the same. However, I do wonder whether there are people like me who feel the impeding career doom in next &lt;10 years in case a substantial pivot is not made.<p>For Senior devs, do you agree with my premise? Have you moved on to a different career? Could you share your interesting career pivot stories?",
