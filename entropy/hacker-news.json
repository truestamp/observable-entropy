      "text": "I&#x27;d like to remove Google from my life as much as possible and the final step is to install an alternative OS onto my phone (either LineageOS or GrapheneOS). I&#x27;ve seen many suggestions to switch communication apps such as WhatsApp out for Signal, however I&#x27;ve not seen much discussion around banking apps. Many banks tend to have their own proprietary apps, with many important (verifying transactions&#x2F;login attempts, acting as &quot;security keys&quot;) and convenient (viewing transaction history quickly) features. I know some banks offer physical &quot;security keys&quot; which can replace the app but this does not apply to every bank, with some only offering their core services through the app and a stripped back version on web&#x2F;desktop.<p>Have you experienced anything similar? What have you done to get around this? If I can&#x27;t find an alternative method to access these utilities I&#x27;ll probably just bite the bullet and keep Google around for a little while longer (or until I can switch to a bank that offers a web-only experience - tangentially, are their any banks like this?).<p>Thank you for your time!",
