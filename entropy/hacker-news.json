      "text": "I have a nascent OSS project that helps deal with cloud infrastructure and want to test it on the free tiers of many cloud providers.<p>Unsurprisingly, the cloud providers only provide partial tooling to limit charges, and they are pretty cloud-specific.<p>One of the big sticking points is the credit card. I don&#x27;t want to use my main credit cards &#x2F; sources, I&#x27;d like to use a dedicated one with a low limit that will start rejecting charges quickly.<p>The &quot;preloaded&quot; cards are targeted at lower incomes with tons of predatory policies like decreasing balances and fees, and might not even be accepted by the providers. I wanted one of those for carrying around emergency money but couldn&#x27;t find a single one that was intolerably predatory.<p>Otherwise any tools or &quot;code zoos&quot; for this specific task?<p>Anyone have any other tips around structuring your accounts for the clouds that will help lock them?",
