      "text": "Back in the day everyone was building their own PCs: chose a motherboard, a CPU, RAM, a video card, an audio card, a power supply, verify the compatibility, assemble and pack it into a case. It was flexible, customizable, easy to evolve (unless you change the motherboard), and easy to repair. It was also buggy and a lot of fun. At least the way I remember it.<p>Today I buy a laptop and everything is pre-assembled. I still get to choose the configuration, but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same. And voids a lot of the above features. Except that it may still be buggy. Also, the real reason I moved to laptops is because they are, well, mobile. Now, with the remote work I spend my day at the same desk. So I would like to give it a try: assemble my own PC again. (Not a laptop, the Framework Laptop is definitely not what I am looking for.)<p>Are there online resources that can bring me up to speed with how you do that in 2022? How to choose the components, make sure they are compatible...<p>Do you have recommendations for where to buy the components? (I&#x27;m in Europe)<p>Thank you, and good luck with your New Year&#x27;s resolutions!",
