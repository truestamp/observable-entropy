Especially when one part of the couple is less technical. I have the feeling a lot of thought process and software products go into team management in a work context. Not sure this assumption is true but only few couples seem to have designed an explicit system to manage their personal life. I&#x27;d like to learn from the ones who think they implemented such a system successfully - what worked, etc. (under the caveat that every couple is different of course!)",
