When I search for something like this all I can find is OCR tech or digital note taking solutions. I don&#x27;t want to use upwork etc. because of the variability in the load. One week I may need 10 pages next I may only need 1.<p>I know this is an old school problem but I have tried digital note taking and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.",
