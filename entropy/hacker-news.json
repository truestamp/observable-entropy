      "text": "I applied for a CTO job in a small company (30 people in total) and got the job. The interviews were with CEO and a round with members of the board (not much technical but mostly they were checking me as a person I believe) and a round of lunch with some of the software engineers.<p>I worked as Principal Software Engineer or IC5 beforehand in the big tech and my job was mostly a combination of being in constant communication to our VP and other senior engineers&#x2F;managers for directions and doing architecture, design, coaching, and so on for the few teams in the org.<p>I was wondering if anyone here has any recommendations on what to read to better get prepared for the role. I know that I would be doing more human management as part of the job, probably some more workforce budgeting, and strategy settings; but I would be grateful if anyone here has similar experience and want to share some.",
