      "text": "Hello HN community!<p>I must say that over the years I&#x27;ve been very thankful for all of the insights, discussion, and intellectual vigor you all show on this platform. There have been so many things I&#x27;ve learned from you all and I wouldn&#x27;t be the same without you. You are all invaluable and even the smallest of comments is well appreciated and most always provides a way of looking at things that was not considered before.<p>3 years ago I had an idea that I wanted to start a business to sell a budgeting app. What I thought would be a capitalistic venture turned out to be a side project that I&#x27;ve had and grown into (what I feel) is quite substantial and has a niche now in the community. I have not posted, nor shared its progress in quite some time, but the template is fully featured now and many are making use of it to build apps themselves.<p>The template itself is an Electron template, secure-electron-template, and in this blog post I write about it&#x27;s origins, it&#x27;s feature set, and how it was able to grow to 1,000 Github stars. All of this is thanks to the HN community, thank you for spreading the word about this project and letting me give back through my work of building this template.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debugandrelease.com&#x2F;how-i-gained-1k-stars-on-my-github-project&#x2F;",

I haven&#x27;t found anything and I&#x27;m assuming this kind of data is valuable, so it&#x27;s kept private. If so, what suggestions do you guys have for a one man show to get data on popular math textbooks for high school and college students?<p>Thanks!",
