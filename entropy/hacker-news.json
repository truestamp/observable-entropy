      "text": "Hey folks! I&#x27;m trying to actively get better at pitching developer tools. So I had the idea of collecting an inspiration list of the &quot;best of all time&quot;. Would like to crowdsource this!<p>The vibe I&#x27;m going for is pitches that left you with a clear &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; division in your life where you not only &quot;got it&quot; but also keep referring to it from that point onward.<p>Obvious candidate for example is DHH&#x27;s 15 minute Rails demo (and i&#x27;ve been told the Elixir Liveview demo is similar) and Solomon Hykes&#x27; Docker demo.<p>What other pitch is like that? (or successfully pitches a developer tool in a different way, up to your interpretation)",
