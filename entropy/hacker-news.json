Especially for PowerDNS I see only two options how to get them: webpage[1] and reading logs. Both those options are not such convenient as getting newsletter or even RSS.<p>Maybe you do know any services to get security advisories in RSS reader or at least by email subscription?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.powerdns.com&#x2F;authoritative&#x2F;security-advisories&#x2F;",
