      "text": "I just found out that I’m losing my job at the end of the year - but the current employer owes $108k in severance if I stay through the end.<p>I’m a self taught developer with no experience in a real dev shop. Recruiters tell me I look amazing on paper, but the few screen-interviews I’ve had the interviewer appeared unimpressed or offered me less than I currently make.<p>Should I learn some new skill? Build out an open-source demo project? I feel so overwhelmed with what all I could be doing that I’m doing nothing.<p>Let me know if any other info would help.<p>Thanks.",
