      "text": "Today is the last of the 30 days being disagreed with Facebook&#x27;s decision. First I submitted my national ID card then I had given my passport but there is no response. Because of the linked accounts my messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp has been blocked. I had created this account on 2010. So many memories are connected to it. I have tried to contact Facebook thru email but there is also no response. I get birthday reminders on my email from Facebook everyday, I get &quot;people you may know&quot; notifications occasionally on my Facebook App. I am just stuck at a checkpoint which says I have disagreed with their decision and in a day or two they will review my information.  \nDear people of hacker news, is there a way to get out of this situation?",
