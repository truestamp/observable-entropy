      "text": "Hey HN!<p>I&#x27;m working on a personal finance desktop only application[1]. I&#x27;m a solo developer, doing it in my free time, with the intention to release a great product (and make money from it).<p>I personally dislike Electron Apps and try to avoid them if possible. However I understand the appeal behind them for developers.<p>With my current time, skills and funding - I&#x27;m either able to release an Electron application with decent support for all 3 major OSes with all the drawbacks of Electron (big binary, maybe-slow [my core logic is done in Rust, and JS is used primarily for the UI], alien-looking); or a native for 1 platform, MacOS in my case.<p>I believe in having clean UI and smooth experience, hence the choice of Electron bothers me a lot. On the other side, most of the drawbacks of Electron are expressed by (mainly) tech-savvy people.<p>So, dear HN - what would you pick: Electron or MacOS Only native?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moneypin.app&#x2F;",
