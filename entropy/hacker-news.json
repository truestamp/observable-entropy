      "text": "Background: 38 y&#x2F;o software engineer, married, with a 9 month old daughter, currently in the DC area.  Due to the political climate in the US (off-topic for this thread&#x2F;forum) I&#x27;m interested in securing an alternative citizenship for my daughter at some point in her lifetime.  I understand this would be a large undertaking and assume it&#x27;s not really feasible to cast a wide net, so I was hoping to rank our best options since it seems like we&#x27;ll only have one approach, especially with us being older parents already.<p>I understand some countries would be more desirable than others to emigrate to, but I&#x27;d like to fully understand my options before weighing them.  So for the purposes of this discussion let&#x27;s assume any country is on the table regardless of the current political&#x2F;economic&#x2F;social situation there.<p>I&#x27;m prepared to relocate and work elsewhere but that&#x27;s not a requirement - I just assumed with my skill set it would be the easiest approach.  Bonus points if we (her parents) are able to obtain citizenship as well, but that&#x27;s also not a requirement.<p>Basically I&#x27;m just looking to give her an option when she turns 18 if she needs it.  Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve worked for startups for 10 years and recently joined a FAANG company. Compensation and stability were part of my motivation, but the biggest reason was the assumption that I would be able to work with A+ players solving hard problems.<p>Instead, I&#x27;m on a team that has and horrendous turnover and is staffed with below-average IQ people.<p>This company builds EVERYTHING in house, and the toolset is like going backwards in my career 10 years.<p>If I do want to stick this out and turn this team around, I&#x27;m going to be working nights and weekends for at least a year - there&#x27;s just too much to fix.<p>I&#x27;ve told this to lots of people who work in other division (that I can trust) and they&#x27;ve said the easiest thing is to just accept it as it is and coast. I&#x27;ve never done that in my career and don&#x27;t think I could do that.<p>Has anyone been in the same boat? I&#x27;m told that it becomes easier to switch teams after a year.<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve made a terrible decision and don&#x27;t know what to do next.<p>Any advice is appreciated.",
