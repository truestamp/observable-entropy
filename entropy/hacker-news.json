      "text": "I noticed that when there&#x27;s a backlog of notifications in your notifications queue, the phone intelligently shows calendar events at the top depending on when they&#x27;re actually important with other metrics I actively track on the phone, like sleep quality and sleep duration. (This was a sleep reminder based on when the phone saw that I&#x27;m routinely going to bed, presumably). Whereas other calendar events I&#x27;ve been ignoring the last few days due to other obligations did not show up at the top of the queue despite being more recent &quot;events&quot; in my life than some of the backlogged items I still haven&#x27;t bothered to clear out yet.<p>Would be cool to work at Apple on that stuff. Both the hardware and the software are sooo gorgeous. Super smart calendar reminder in the notifications. I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s the notification&#x27;s system being very intelligent about what to show at the top and when, or if it&#x27;s the calendar app itself running checks periodically on what reminders you actually care about historically, and weighing that in deciding which events&#x2F;reminders to put at the top of the queue?<p>Edit: Or...<p><i>le gasp</i><p>Could it be my iPhone&#x27;s Siri lovingly reminding me to go to bed because <i>chosen Siri pronoun</i> saw that my tone of voice and sleep quality improved when that particular reminder issued at the top consistently vs other reminders that may vye for the top of that queue? What an impactful change since I&#x27;m actually going to respect that calendar reminder even more often as a result! I love that! That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so happy about this lmao! Wow!",
