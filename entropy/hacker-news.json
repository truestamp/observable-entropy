That will keep it all organized and has code syntax.<p>Basically I&#x27;m tasked to break down a lot of code from VB6.  I want a place I can add my code snippets for sql, maybe pseudo code and anything else I might need to add.<p>Maybe break the log up into potential function names.<p>Thanks for the help.",

      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m mostly a lurker on HN who&#x27;s always super inspired by other people&#x27;s small project that end-up making money. (Huge fan of Ben Stoke&#x27;s Tiny Project [0])<p>After being burnt-out in big tech, I decided to write my own weightlifting app and set myself a humble goal of reaching $1000 in total proceeds. See [1] for my initial launch post.<p>I&#x27;ve now surpassed that goal and am now making about 500$&#x2F;mo by selling premium features in the app. Android version is coming soon too. Doing the whole thing end-to-end (code, launch, marketing, support) was super gratifying and taught me a whole lot. I have to admit that I got almost teary eyed the first time someone bought one of my IAPs.<p>I&#x27;m not making a killing out of the app, and that was never the goal. But the personal satisfaction I got out of it was worth everything. I can&#x27;t pretend to have derived any life lesson that applies to everybody from this, but this whole mini-journey was worth it for me, and I hope it will be for you too, should you embark in a similar one.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyprojects.dev&#x2F;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27507452",
