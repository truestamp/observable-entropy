      "text": "AFAIK, one of the bigger problems with implementing PGP on a wider scale is the need to trust a keyserver to provide the correct open keys and update them when necessary. If so, can the database be decentralized via a blockchain so that no entity has absolute control over it? Key rotation can be implemented via additional blocks containing new keys signed by the previous ones. Proof-of-work also functions as a kind of CAPTCHA to solve potential spam issues. Since the rate at which new keys are added shouldn&#x27;t be high, low transaction speed doesn&#x27;t matter either. Would this kind of setup work and if not, why?",
