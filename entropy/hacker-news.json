I&#x27;m curious if there are any electrical or mechanical engineers in the Los Angeles area?<p>The product is a life-sized 3d-printer like device that will be used in the health and beauty space. We are looking to put together the team, finance the MVP while raising angel funds.<p>Please comment if you&#x27;re interested or email me (address in my profile) Thank you!",
