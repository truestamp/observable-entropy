      "text": "So my BitWarden master password stopped working. I am 100% confident that my password has not changed, but the developers changed the way passwords are handled.<p>In the past, my password would work on Chrome, but would fail to work on Mobile. I opened an issue and it was ignored.<p>Now my master password does not work anywhere (APART FROM THS LAPTOP and I was lucky to export my passwords.)<p>So heres a warning to all. Do not use BitWarden, they handle passwords incorrectly and you may lose all your passwords if they decide to randomly change password handling.<p>Possible Problem: They truncate passwords before sending to server? IDK at what length they truncate.",

      "text": "In the past, I&#x27;ve worked on tons of personal projects where I was using Google&#x27;s Video Intelligence API (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;video-intelligence) to track people, objects, and more after recording stuff live on a Raspberry Pi and sending it up to Google.<p>Works great for personal projects (I get 1k minutes free, etc) but do people actually use these APIs in production? $0.15 &#x2F; min for a single model feels expensive at scale, and they only work for such a narrow set of use-cases. I know there are other offerings in AWS Sagemaker (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;sagemaker&#x2F;) that let you build your own models but I don&#x27;t want to deal with any training data or ML hands-on.<p>I&#x27;ve been wondering if others have dealt with this stuff and&#x2F;or worked in environments where they feel the same. Is it expected that I have to use OpenCV + some other things like Sagemaker &#x2F; PyTorch to build image &#x2F; video understanding systems?",
