In the US, I would get a Green Card in two years.<p>My parents live in India and one day I want them living with me, and that is easier in the US too as there is no lottery or wait time for immediate relatives (Canada has lottery system, 200k people apply for the same 20k spots and more and more people will be applying each year). But, Canada has a Supervisa system where parents can come to Canada with me as a PR and live for two years.<p>Most importantly, for the future, opportunities are limitless in the US, salaries are 2x to 3x that of Canada, healthcare is better and faster, houses are cheaper (except SF and maybe NYC) compared to Toronto. I know very well-educated engineers and doctors from Canada moving to the US for these reasons - future seems bleak for Canada.<p>What would you do?",
