Currently its just a Rust backend and an Angular frontend, no logins, etc.<p>Is there anything off the shelf that can help, 1) user management and 2) subscriptions? I&#x27;d rather not get too bogged down in these details myself.<p>I know there are services like Auth0 to help with the authentication (social signon and 2fa are a must), and Stripe for payments, but anything a little more integrated from the start?<p>It would be OK if I had to run something like a Python application beside mine for user management.<p>Thanks.",
