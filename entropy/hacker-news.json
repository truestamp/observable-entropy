      "text": "Specifically core projects like V8 and Blink, considering how hard it is to get a job at Google anyway.<p>It’s been a long time dream of mine, something I could see myself immersing my life in and having absolutely no problem.<p>But my experience is in enterprise roles often doing maintenance work, UI, and business logic. I’ve worked with C# primarily, I have 3 months industry experience in C++ and learned it in uni. I have a CS degree and did not go to a prestigious school which seems to be a common theme among a lot of popular devs like Eric Seidel and Lars Bak.<p>I’m 27 right now, is it possible I can contribute to some of the projects and get my foot in the door? Or will it always be volunteer work because I can’t invert a tree off the top of my head during a white board interview.",
