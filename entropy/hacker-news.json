      "text": "I have owned a business doing tech for my entire adult life. I recently (over a year ago) took a job for the first time in 20 years, my other business I sold most of it off, and maintain a few customers. I am doing IT related stuff in the new job (right up my alley). But the key reason I came on board was the offer of ownership.<p>Future ownership as an option has been rescinded this past week.<p>The job is a good job, the people I work with are great, there is likely a really bad boss coming in 10 years or so. (complicated) Pay is decent. I&#x27;ve not been in the job market ever really (since college), and I only took this job because it was a business building opportunity, not just IT.<p>How should I be looking at this? I will get a chunk of cash buyout sometime in the new few years, but I can&#x27;t retire on it. But I won&#x27;t have anymore skin in the game.<p>I could leave right now, and I still get my buyout (unusual arrangements I made) and go back to starting another business. Heck, even resurrect my old one.<p>Has anyone found happiness by just sort of giving up and just sitting back and relaxing into a job?<p>Any help suggestions, advice would be appreciated.",
