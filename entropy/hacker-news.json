      "text": "I was an early Instagram user and got my nickname as my handle and I keep getting either locked out of my account or compromised altogether.<p>Over the years, hackers have tried a number of things to steal my handle and I can usually tell how they get in. These days, I have no idea. I&#x27;ve been SIM swapped a handful of times. One time a hacker faxed a fake ID to Godaddy to try and swap out my domain to gain control of my email (they were successful).<p>Now, I will try to log in to my account and will just be locked out. The email I created specifically for Instagram is not recognized, and there is no way to reset my password.<p>I have two-factor auth on, I don&#x27;t use the same password anywhere else, I change it regularly, etc.<p>My current theory is there is some employee at Meta that&#x27;s ultimately stealing the account. Does anybody have any idea how they&#x27;re hacking me?<p>PS: the worst part about all this is in order to get the handle back, I have to pull strings with folks I know at Meta, for a normal user, they would have absolutely no way of regaining access...",
