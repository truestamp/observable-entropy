      "text": "My name is Tudor, founder of Bookly.\nWe started as a game studio(we are still making games) but had this idea running in my head for a while. There are apps that help you run more, that help you workout, or walk, and make a habit of all these physical activities, but there isn&#x27;t one that helps you make a habit of reading. That is where Bookly came from. We took everything we learned in games and applied to reading, making it fun, engaging with a sense of progress.",
