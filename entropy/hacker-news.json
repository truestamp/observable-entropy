(A household fiber connection can scan the entire IPv4 space in a mere matter of weeks)<p>This is obviously a huge threat to CloudFlare’s entire business model and it totally makes sense that they want to bury this.<p>I just fail to understand what grounds they have to take something like this down. Internet IPs are public knowledge and these websites are publicly accessible. Just because Cloudflare built a billion dollar buisness exploiting the fact that sites “real” IPs can be hidden through obscurity, doesn’t mean they should be able to censor&#x2F;takedown apps that expose the flaw in their business plan!<p>Anyways, I intend to create a new internet-wide scanning system in order to revive the functionality of  CrimeFlare just to prove a point that security through obscurity is no security and all, and that CloudFlare doesn’t have the right to take something like this down!",
