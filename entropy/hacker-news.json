      "text": "This question is inspired by: &quot;How I would start my next startup in Germany without a GmbH (2020)&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31601638)<p>Say you want to set up a startup and the founders live in Germany, the US, Australia and Singapore. Your team will be fully remote from day one.<p>You are looking for a solution where\n- the company is fully operational within days or weeks and can be set up without all founders having to come together in person\n- day to day business can managed remotely (e.g. together with local tax advisor &#x2F; lawyer)\n- the jurisdiction has a solid good reputation\n- the legal frameworks are understood and accepted by US &#x2F; EU investors and VCs\n- complying with all requirements around hiring employees is not too much of a burden\n- official language of documents is English<p>Where would you incorporate and why?<p>I&#x27;ve looked into the US (obviously..), UK, Cayman (I know YC allows Cayman legal entities), Hong Kong, Cyprus etc. and see at lot of pros and cons for each option.<p>If you&#x27;ve gone through the process, can you share some insights and whether you&#x27;d do it again this way?",
