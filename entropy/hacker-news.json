      "text": "Oberon makes it possible for a service provider to issue capability tokens to clients in such a way that the service provider never sees the value of the capability token. This prevents the service provider from being able to impersonate the client.\nOberon relies upon zero-knowledge proof presentation of the capability token so that the token is never transmitted norrevealed. Instead of the client sending the token to the service—as is done with API tokens today—the client sends a zero-knowledge proof proving that they have a valid capability token issued by the service provider; this is called proof-of-knowledge.<p>GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cryptidtech&#x2F;oberoncryptid<p>Get cryptid: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptid.tech]",
