      "text": "Hello HN, I am a professional software engineer, but coding stopped being my full-time job in 2015. Now I am quite unsure what is the best way to start a web app today. I need to create a mostly CRUD-only app: an E-commerce website with an admin interface. It is important to have the code, since some custom features are required + owning IP matters for me.<p>Stack-wise, I like React and relational databases.<p>I suppose there are at least two possible solutions: 1) templates, like themeforest, 2) starter kits, like create-react-app.<p>Is there anything else? How would one start a web app today?<p>Thanks",
