I’ve signed several agreements that prevent you from going to competitors for a year or two after leaving but haven’t seen this one yet.<p>“Future Innovations.  I will disclose promptly in writing to Company all Innovations conceived, reduced to practice, created, derived, developed, or made by me during my employment with Company and for three (3) months thereafter, whether or not I believe the Innovations are subject to this Agreement, to permit a determination by Company as to whether or not the Innovations are or should be considered Company Innovations.  Company will receive that information in confidence.”<p>Has anyone else come across something like this? Is this normal? Any ideas on how to handle it?",
