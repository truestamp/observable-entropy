      "text": "I am currently evaluating different clouds and I am not sure if I should pay much attention to Azure given that we are not a typical .NET shop.<p>I have worked with .NET in the past and know that most &quot;.NET shops&quot; normally work on a very Microsofty vertical stack. SQL Server, Azure, Windows Servers, IIS, .NET, C#, Entity Framework, etc., however I haven&#x27;t programmed in .NET for a very long time and I&#x27;m not sure if Azure is a good fit for a mostly Node, Python and Go team?<p>Does anyone have much experience with Azure from a complete non .NET perspective? I wonder what is the support for SDKs in other langages like. Are they any good? Do Azure services have good support for Node, Python and Go? For example in GCP I can debug Go code directly from the console and I wonder if Azure offers similar features or if they have most things tailored to .NET only?<p>I know that AWS works great with any language so I wanted to ask shall we just stick with AWS or is there a good case for switching to GCP or Azure?",
