      "text": "It is a question that has been on my mind a lot, and which causes me to go to sleep late as I am browsing to find the next thing that has not hit the mainstream yet.<p>Where or how, or what kind of approach should I undertake to increase my chances of spotting something that has the potential to become important in the future? What kind of news outlets should I target, as when its news its already out there and thus I am too late. Or other way around, if its not reported anywhere, how could I know about it (chicken or egg problem as well).<p>Some silly examples:<p>- How could I have known about the internet before it was popularized?\n- How could I have known or heard about Bitcoin before it went mainstream? \n- How could I have found a coin that was later listed on Binance?<p>Some might say that certain things are due to circumstances, eg if I was working at IBM or Microsoft at the time, I would have heard about the internet before.<p>However, this can not be it. It cannot be that it is just luck or being there at the right time. There must be more ways, or a certain mindset, to optimize and increase the chances. What are your ideas or approaches to this?",
