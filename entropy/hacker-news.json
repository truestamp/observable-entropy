      "text": "I was wondering which companies train freelance&#x2F;self taught developers to get their first software engineering role who have not pursued a degree in computer science?<p>For example, say someone started learning computer science fundamentals, iOS development, and has published 10 apps to the App Store. Say they&#x27;ve been doing this for 3 years and can pretty much code anything you tell them to. But they don&#x27;t know how to do unit tests and other things you learn on the job. Are there any companies willing to pay ~$20&#x2F;hr-$25&#x2F;hr training and possibly doing some real publishable work?",
