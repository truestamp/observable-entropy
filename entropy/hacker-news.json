With this in mind, we went back to the drawing board, wrote thousands of lines of code, and added a bunch of features. We’re now thrilled to share what we’ve been working on.<p>Our updated platform covers 48,000 companies, 180,000 options,  3,500,000 bonds, 3,000 commodities, 11,000 institutions, 10,000 individuals, and 24 countries. Feather allows you to discover, analyze, and identify winning trades ahead of the market.<p>Excited to re-launch Feather’s early-access waitlist with revamped features and share with the HN community.<p>Check it out!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;try-feather.com",
