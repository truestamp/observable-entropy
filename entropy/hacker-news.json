      "text": "I have a need for calling a function hosted on aws lambda based on dynamic interval. The function usually needs to be called for few hours a day to do some data processing. Because I’m calling external services, sometimes I would call this function on 5 minute interval or could be longer if I run into rate limit issues. So I’m thinking of writing a service which would allow the endpoints to pass back the time (eg 5m or 1h) as a response header to define when to call the function again.<p>I know it’s very specific use case but is this something that can be extended for other uses cases? Trying to figure out if it’s worth building a micro SaaS",
