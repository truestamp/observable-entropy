      "text": "Hi there,<p>Hope you are all well.<p>I have a bit of an odd request.<p>I am looking at getting an NFT smart contract created that has the mint functionality link an NFT to a verifiable credential issued to a decentralized identifier (outside of the smart contract) instead of just an IPFS link. So maybe even in the smart contract it would link to an IPFS JSON file which contains the credential information such as the metadata and image of the NFT as well as the DID it is associated with. But this would be static, which leads me to my next point.<p>Therefore, there needs to be a new functionality coded that will be executed when a transfer of an NFT occurs, the verifiable credential is revoked and reissued to the new holder.<p>Is this possible?",
