      "text": "I&#x27;ve seen this book come up a lot over the years in tech circles and finance circles, even more so now with tech and finance seeming to merge together with cryptocurrency. I don&#x27;t agree with every idea of Rand&#x27;s but there are some very interesting parallels for sure.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about things like the world being angry at Facebook but when there is an outage, millions of people seem to be freaking out. Also the world having mixed feelings about Amazon and consumerism but when the world&#x27;s shipping infrastructure is having issues, people realize how much they rely on e-commerce these days. Imagine if Big Tech just stopped working for a day, imagine the world&#x27;s computing grid just going offline completely for even an hour.<p>I live in Maui and notice that a lot of tech billionaires and millionaires buy land or estates here. This is kind of a &#x27;utopian paradise&#x27; in their eyes. The irony is that there is a lot of issues in Hawai&#x27;i that most tourists just aren&#x27;t aware of.<p>I could write a lot more but I think you get the idea. I&#x27;m curious to hear what you think and feel. I know this is a loaded question but it&#x27;s Saturday and this is the only place I know that would take a question like this seriously.<p>Thank you for reading and contributing",
