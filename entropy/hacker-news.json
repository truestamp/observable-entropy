      "text": "Hi Hacker News!<p>We released a new meeting scheduling product today! You can use Bookable Schedule in Boomerang for Gmail or our iOS app to create a set of availabilities and share it as many times as you’d like inside your email. Recipients receive an image of your live availabilities and through the use of image maps, they can see and pick the right appointment slots directly inside whichever email client they’re using.<p>If the recipient also has Boomerang, they can overlay their calendar on top of the schedule (still inside the email) to see which times work best for them! It works great for things like office hours, client appointments, sales calls, and more. It also doesn&#x27;t shift the work of scheduling meetings to the person you&#x27;re inviting, so it&#x27;s better etiquette[1] and easier for recipients as well as the scheduler.<p>Please feel free to take a look and play with it, we’d love to hear your thoughts!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JCornebise&#x2F;status&#x2F;1486809751602319371\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JCornebise&#x2F;status&#x2F;1486809751602319371</a><p>(By the way, we are hiring for frontend and fullstack devs - i.want.to.work at baydin . com)",
