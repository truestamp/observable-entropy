      "text": "With all the constructive feedback I&#x27;ve been getting from you folks lately, I&#x27;m starting to build some confidence in my own abilities while learning about the things that I may not be so good at [1]. Specifically, other than the writing that I will be posting on my personal website, I think I will very much enjoy building a community around my work, where I will get to engage regularly with like-minded people, exchange advice and perspectives, maybe do some AMAs etc.<p>So the question is, what&#x27;s a good platform for engaging with an audience&#x2F;community?<p>Right now I&#x27;m thinking Discord as my primary choice, as it&#x27;s very low-barrier and super chill, and it doesn&#x27;t place too much pressure on me to have to continually produce content (I work slowly). I can just take in people&#x27;s comments and stories and rants etc etc and offer my take on it all. It&#x27;ll also be nice to see the whole community in one place! (In fact I&#x27;ve already set one up if anyone&#x27;s interested! [2]).<p>I&#x27;m also curious about using Twitch for live-streams. The people I know in real life seem to like my positive-presence, so maybe this is a good place to show my face and be more friendly and personal. But I&#x27;ve never used Twitch ever (aside from seeing them on youtube), so I&#x27;m completely unfamiliar with how to set things up there, how much learning curve there is (eg do I need to edit videos?), whether the audience expect regular content, what types of features are available, etc.. If anyone&#x27;s familiar with this I&#x27;d love to hear all about it!<p>Other options include Substack&#x2F;newsletters, but these aren&#x27;t so interactive, and definitely puts pressure on me having to produce often. Then there&#x27;s Youtube in general, which is an interesting place to upload more cleaned up material (eg a video essay), but I&#x27;m also worried about it taking more work as I&#x27;m not a video-maker.<p>Anyway, would love to get some feedback from you awesome smart people!!<p>Thank you so much in advance!<p>Sam<p>[1]: Just last night I posted a thread about giving people advice (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31065876), but after trying to help several people, I realized I&#x27;m not very good at giving people <i>specific</i> advice tailored to their unique situations (even though I would love to!). I&#x27;m much better at sharing general&#x2F;philosophical advice or insights from observing general phenomena -- hence why I have enjoyed writing so far. Sorry folks!<p>[2]: Discord invite link! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;ZZN3v7Usdx",
