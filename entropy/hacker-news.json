      "text": "I have a brand new ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 GA401QM-K2030T, but with great disappointment, I found that it has severe issues with running Xubuntu Linux 21.10. The system is freezing when idle for some time and it cannot recognize my external monitor connected via HDMI after I did `apt dist-upgrade`. I suspect that both issues are due to the video card drivers. The laptop has two video cards. One integrated on the Ryzen™ 9 5900HX CPU and one discrete NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060. When running Windows it dynamically changes the active GPU according to the load. I&#x27;m not sure which one is used when I&#x27;m running Linux, but I installed the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. Unfortunately, it does not resolve the issues. Could someone give any suggestions on how to resolve those problems? I asked in the &quot;Ask Ubuntu&quot; stack exchange but still no answers.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;askubuntu.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;1372765&#x2F;second-monitor-stopped-working-after-executing-dist-upgrade<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;askubuntu.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;1372771&#x2F;xubuntu-21-10-is-freezing-after-closing-the-laptop-lid",
