      "text": "Growing up in middle class family, I had almost no internet access till high school. I could read a book till hours and no one would bother me. I was not affected by any social media announcements or fast track news making my brain(tinkered by thousand years of evolution) go into panic stage. Life was more routined and controlled as I wanted to be. Less access to resources meaning I had to work around solutions and do things creatively without pressure of posting it on internet.<p>Now, I get distracted by so many new things coming up. Each new venue or event brings up a new opportunity. I am in my mid 20s and planning to get married. So, I have to invest in future like Mutual funds, stocks etc. I have to think about buying a house in next 10 years as the real estate prices are going up. I have a decent paying job but I have a fear that it will not be be enough for my retirement. So, I have either invest in opportunities like NFTs, cyrptocurrency, real estate etc. or start working on my own startup. I wanted to learn a lot of things but keep getting distracted.<p>So, how can I get boring once again? Boringly passionate about what I want to do. Is there any stream where I can work in and feel safe about it? Or Is it even possible for the remanants of Industrial Age to work in boringly passionate way as this doesn&#x27;t suit work style of information age?<p>PS: I am looking for specific techniques, tricks or strategies which anyone has applied in their life and working for them. I am already going through the abstract advices on life goals, philosophy, values, beliefs etc.",
