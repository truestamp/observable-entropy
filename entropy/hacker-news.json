      "text": " Hello everyone,<p>I’m Hari, and I’m a serial Microstartup Maker. 2021 has been an amazing year despite the pandemic where I reached my recent goal of $500&#x2F;day. Compounding works everywhere, even in microstartups. It took 3 years to reach to $300&#x2F;day but just 4 months to $500&#x2F;day. The business model of my microstartups is a mix of App sales, subscriptions, affiliates and ads. I&#x27;m now spending just 10% of my time to maintain and fix bugs. My next goal is to reach $600&#x2F;day.<p>My Microstartups Rewind 2021<p>* Revenue - $117K&#x2F;year (67% ▲)<p>* Expenses - 3K&#x2F;year<p>* All time high revenue - $15K&#x2F;month in Dec (18% ▲)<p>* Daily goal - $500&#x2F;day reached in Dec<p>Visa List - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visalist.io<p>* Revenue - $50K&#x2F;year (39% ▲)<p>* All time high revenue - $8K&#x2F;month in Dec<p>* Total Users - 2.6M&#x2F;year<p>* Active users - 250K&#x2F;month<p>AnExplorer - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anexplorer.co<p>* Revenue - $50K&#x2F;year (95% ▲)<p>* User growth: 130% ▲ yoy<p>* Active users: 350K<p>ACrypto - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acrypto.io<p>* Revenue - $10K&#x2F;year<p>* Active users: 30K",
