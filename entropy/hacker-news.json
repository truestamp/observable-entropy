I&#x27;ve other, non-engineering experience outside of that - I&#x27;m nearly 40.<p>I have just 2-3 years engineering experience, at small startups over the last few years, mostly as an IC, but also some management.<p>I&#x27;ve (somehow) managed to land a job as a Senior Engineering Manager at a unicorn. I&#x27;ll be managing a team of 8-10 engineers, from leads to juniors. I won&#x27;t be coding.<p>I&#x27;m confident in my people management, project management, networking etc skills and I love software engineering, but I&#x27;m worried my lack of engineering experience is going to hold me back and I&#x27;ll fail in this new role.<p>What do you think? Do you have any experiences like this or being managed by someone like this and what they struggled with? Advice on books &#x2F; blogs etc I can read to try and get up to speed would also be great.",
