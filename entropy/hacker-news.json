Maybe someone here can weigh in. \nWe are not super happy with the process in Germany (having to go to the notary, long waiting times etc.) and taxes are so-so.\nDo alternatives like Ireland (low taxes) or Estonia (easy process) make sense when we would never actually move to those countries? Especially considering we might scale up, have employees etc.?<p>I am curious about incorporating in the UK, but I assume that Brexit made operating there a lot more difficult.<p>Any shared experiences would be much appreciated!",
