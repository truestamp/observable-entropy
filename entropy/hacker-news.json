This will be a great learning experiences for both of us, as I’ve been focused on more product planning than product development in my professional path.<p>That said, are there any resources available on working with kids to build software requirements (functional and non functional)? As well as learning some technical skills, I’d like to expose my kid to some of the planning aspects of a project like this.<p>Anything in the real of project planning that is oriented towards younger audiences is greatly appreciated!",
