      "text": "I&#x27;ve had a person report and send me a video that Chrome would begin casting what seemed to be a Instagram web page to a smart tv on the same wi-fi network, while his screen was sitting idle on a Chrome blank page. Unfortunately it was a shared wi-fi and he doesn&#x27;t know where that TV is. This is inferred from a popup[0] appearing out of the Cast icon(?) next to Chrome&#x27;s three-dots menu. I&#x27;ve instructed him to disable casting via chrome&#x27;s flags, and am trying to understand whether private information could have leaked from this and how that happened. My guess for now would be &quot;Web Presentation API&quot; alongside a Instagram page misbehavior, in that case I imagine someone may have seen that web page and that alone, but am unsure as I&#x27;m not knowledgeable on the Web protocols. Or, in a worse scenario, someone in that wi-fi managed to force this action.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;2VBbu0v.png",
