      "text": "- 90% of the best engineers are never actively on the market<p>- The best time to reach this 90% is when they are open to opportunities, but not actively looking<p>- Most engineers are not primarily focused on building their network to set themselves up for great opportunities<p>So every couple of weeks I round up cloud-related jobs from around my network. (Why cloud, specifically? It&#x27;s what I know, and I find it&#x27;s more helpful to specialize than generalize.)<p>I have a few biases for how I put this list together:<p>• Full-time remote<p>• AWS, Azure, and&#x2F;or GCP<p>• Salary range (where I can get it)<p>• A mix of junior, mid-level, senior, and leadership roles<p>• And, most importantly, an inside referral contact for every single job.<p>Latest issue is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloudirregular.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-best-jobs-in-cloud-dec-16-2021",
