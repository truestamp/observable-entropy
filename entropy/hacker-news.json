      "text": "VoiceLine has built a chrome extension that allows you to record, share, and play voice notes within any browser-based application. We’re using an STT model to transcribe your notes into what we call a VoiceLine, a hybrid audio-text snippet, to address the problems of conventional voice messaging.<p>Since we’ve been in closed beta as a seed-stage startup, here’s a direct link to get access:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.getvoiceline.com&#x2F;6b29fbc80d<p>Our vision is to introduce a new category of professional voice communication by building our service as a layer, not yet another instant messenger like Slack or MS teams. Since the majority of collaboration happens in the browser, our first MVP has been built for google chrome. We envision this to work in collaboration tools like Jira, GitHub, G Suite, Notion, … you name it.<p>For us, feedback right now is most valuable: Where would you like to use this? What kind of features do you miss or would you expect? How would you build the Chrome Extension going forward?",
