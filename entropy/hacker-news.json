Even in serious moments, I don&#x27;t know why but if I&#x27;m in a group I need to make a joke and make people laugh at something in the situation that&#x27;s ridiculous. For example we had an incident and I couldn&#x27;t help myself - I don&#x27;t know if this is good or bad, but I find it really hard to be serious. There&#x27;s something in the situation that I find to be out of place and I bring it up. I do my job and take my responsibilities in stride and complete what&#x27;s necessary. But... It is really hard for me to be in situations that are serious and I just can&#x27;t help myself when its so dry and boring.",
