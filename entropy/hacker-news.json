Going so far as to add concepts to the code that don&#x27;t belong (or work for that matter), applying shiny new ideas from stackoverflow that bog down the system where a simple line will suffice.<p>Hour long tasks for them take a whol work week because of back and forth with PR comments.<p>The other member is a copy paster who will grab anything from anywhere (old projects, the web) and paste it in and expect something to happen (it doesn&#x27;t).<p>I&#x27;m going on vacation and all PR&#x27;s require my approval. I dread the mess I will have to sift through when I get back, could push the project back weeks.<p>What can I do in this situation?<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many thoughts going through your mind regarding the team and perhaps my lack of managment skills but I am only lead on the project, I don&#x27;t manage people.<p>My boss trusts my judgement and is aware of the situation but he is not technical enough to take over the code reviews.<p>Is there a possible solution to this without adversely affecting the porject?<p>Thanks",
