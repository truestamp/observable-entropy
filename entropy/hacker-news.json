If I come across a website that starts by talking about what tailbone pain is, whether cushion pillows help with that or not, what the benefits are for the coccyx, etc., I&#x27;m pretty sure that website is crap and is doing all this to improve their SEO and their recommended products are likely paid-ads.<p>On the other hand, if I see a website (or a blog) that goes straight to the point and tells me what the best pillow cushions are, I&#x27;m more likely to trust that recommendation.<p>Is there any way that we can decrease the score of SEO-improved websites so that only the ones that aren&#x27;t SEO-optimized can be shown at the top? Any extension or search engine that does that would do us all a huge favor.",
