      "text": "I&#x27;m part of a 20-some group of developers who maintain around 7 components (websites and microservices) for a single domain in our company (e.g. delivery tracking domain).<p>In order to ensure quality, we have &quot;domain scoped end to end tests&quot;. The problem with our E2E tests though is the combination of microservice versions in our E2E tests may not be the same as production because each microservice is independently deployable.<p>Is E2E testing less important in a microservice world?<p>How do you handle this problem?<p>Do you:<p>- Run your full E2E suite after the component has been deployed to production? - I imagine that this can become a bottleneck and probably more flaky since nothing is mocked.<p>- Deploy your components together so that the versions that get deployed to prod are the same as what&#x27;s in E2E? - seems to be distributed monolith but I guess it could work if the domain only has a couple of components.<p>- Accepted the fact that CI and production will never have the identical components.",
