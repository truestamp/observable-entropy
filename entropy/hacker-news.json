      "text": "No doubt, Apple is known for their products. But am starting to think, whether they still put a lot of attention building them. Here is why, I thought so…<p>Apple hosts a community website (discussions.apple.com), which allows community participation in it. This acts a repository to finding solution to your problems in Apple products.<p>Recently saw a HN: Thread (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discussions.apple.com&#x2F;thread&#x2F;252433556) where some specific problem to display was mentioned.<p>Surprisingly I found same post tagged with “Me Too” by a number of people, who might face the issue.<p>Apple should realise that allowing “Me Too” tag is recipe for disaster according to Behavioural Design principles.<p>These sort of tags funnels the user into the issue, making a impact on the Apple’s reputation. People find easy to click “Me Too” and Apple might be driven towards issues that have higher “Me Too” counts.<p>Apple should take down the “Me Too” from public and instead, have some insights of the customer community with private questions like,<p>&gt; I have exact the same problem\n&gt; I am facing similar problem\n&gt; I don’t have this problem<p>We could frame questions like this to the discussion users and get insights from them. The same insights can be shared publicly as well.<p>I feel, This approach will avoid unwanted attention to some posts, which is amplified by the Human Group Behaviour.<p>Please leave your suggestion below.",
