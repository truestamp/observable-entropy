My childhood friendships have withered, my divorce left me untrusting of women (at least for now). I work alone and don&#x27;t have many opportunities to meet new people organically.<p>The thing is I don&#x27;t even like hanging out with people most of the time but I get into this space where it feels like a biological necessity.<p>Does anyone have any tips on how to give myself attention? Or, in other words, how can I learn to be alone without feeling lonely? I feel like I need this lifeskill in order to proceed in my life.<p>I have a pattern of loneliness pushing me into making very foolish decisions.",
