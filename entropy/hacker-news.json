Essentially the core features are:<p>Consumer facing – give people the ability to request services, select a category, urgency, etc.<p>Provider facing – serve them jobs that they are qualified to do (based on category), allow them to &quot;claim&quot; jobs, and then get paid upon completion while the Platform takes a scrape.<p>Would a &quot;no code&quot; solution such as Bubble work?",
