      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m incredibly fortunate to be a US software dev working remotely from a very low CoL country. The company I work for is great too. Super understanding about stress and life commitments, and well managed projects without excessive meetings. Furthermore, we make a product that I actually believe is good.<p>My problem is that I will be moving back to the US in 1-2 year with my family and we want to live in a high CoL part of the US (where her family lives).<p>She is not a US citizen, so we will be single income for a while.<p>My raise last year was less than 10% with a promotion and it was the biggest on my team.<p>Is there a way I can communicate to my company that I would need at least a 50% raise over the next two years in order to provide for my family?<p>I know people here like to say &quot;Just live somewhere cheaper&quot;, but I&#x27;m sure you could understand that we would very much like to live near her American family.",

For example a standard &quot;www&quot; record.<p>It is widely considered a &quot;sub-domain&quot; but I&#x27;d argue it is not, but a &quot;regular&quot; hostname (in case of aforementioned record types) instead.<p>Reason for that logic would be that a (sub-)domain is a domain&#x2F;realm of entities (records managed via its nameservers). An A record would not satisfy such a definition.<p>Taken from Wikipedia<p>&gt; A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet.<p>Though Wikipedia also follows the standard definition - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Subdomain<p>I wonder if this is a similar misnaming as when people regularly confuse traffic and bandwidth.",
