      "text": "A &quot;psych<i>&quot; in the title means Psychology, Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, Psychotherapy, Psychological operations - all studies of the human brain which are not Neurophysiology and whose names derive from Psyche (mythology).<p>At present, I have only one example of an unbearable truth that follows from these fields - the Weber–Fechner law [1]. It seems that this single law is the origin of a brand new mental discipline called Psychophysics which has given us cool things like some lossy digital formats - but it seems that Psychophysics is not even close to the Medicine I am asking about.<p>If not using all kinds of euphemism, my question could be read like this &quot;Are all psych</i> medical workers just a scammers?&quot; but of course that&#x27;s not the level of harshness that I want to establish, because mental professionals have some amazing skills to make some bullies the loser in a discussion. It&#x27;s just that I have a feeling that these specialists are not from a discipline that I can trust, but I have no facts other than the well-known crisis of replication in psychology and medical research [2].<p>So let me formulate a friendlier version of the question: is it worth trusting any psych* specialist if all their knowledge come from unreliable sources like astrological-fashioned theories of interpersonal compatibility, and all their methods seem to be aimed at fooling around like a Scientology&#x27;s E-meter based polygraph? I once used to cheat a lie detector in an interview to cover up some issues that I don&#x27;t want my boss to know about, so after such a success, I will never go back to believing in mind-based fields of &quot;scientific&quot; knowledge unless there are really strong arguments.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Replication_crisis",
