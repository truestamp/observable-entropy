      "text": "Hello and Happy New Year HN! Hope all the bests in 2022. So I&#x27;ve been working on a minimal calendar app , named Clendar (Calendar without an &#x27;a&#x27;). I know, it&#x27;s not a good SEO name, but I will go with it :)<p>I&#x27;ve been building Clendar on my spare time. At first, it&#x27;s just a side weekend project so that I can learn new Apple technologies, but, the app came to the point of usability that I think I should publish on the App Store anyway for the world to know and use it. Besides, I have been trying to design the app for minimal and usability in mind. Also, the app is fully open-source, as a way for me to give back to the app developers community.<p>+ App Store: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;clendar-a-calendar-app&#x2F;id1548102041<p>+ Landing page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clendar.info<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions, thanks!",
