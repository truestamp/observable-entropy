      "text": "Hey folks,\nI am setting up a startup and looking to register it in the US (I am not a US citizen or resident). Have a few friends and family (again, not in the US) who are willing to invest in it. However, their funds are currently parked in cryptocurrencies (mostly, but not all btc). Are there easy, legal ways for them to invest, using these funds, in the newly registered startup? One possibility would be for the newly registered startup to set up an account on an exchange, receive these funds in tokens, transfer into dollars. Is this possible and do you know if there is a precedent? Has anyone here tried this? Thanks!",
