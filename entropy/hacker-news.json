      "text": "With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a lot of people are thinking about supply chains, especially when those chains are rooted in a hostile foreign country.<p>What happens (to the US, EU, or whatever else you might have insight on) if TSMC is destroyed, say during a Chinese invasion of Taiwan? Are we facing a &quot;1-year supply shortage while companies retool to US&#x2F;EU fabs&quot;, or &quot;nobody gets new electronics&#x2F;cars for 5 years while whole chips are designed and fabbed, and their containing systems completely reworked&quot;?<p>The former case sounds inconvenient - the latter sounds like it would cause riots in at least some countries (most notably the US with our electronics addiction and high silicon-per-capita ratio).",
