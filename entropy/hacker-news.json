It was an inspiration to see so many people working to make things better.<p>Being part of a community that was solving problems, &quot;improving the world,&quot; gave me hope and purpose.<p>Then, because of my own hope &amp; purpose, I felt like I was able to contribute to hope &amp; purpose in other people.<p>But things are changing.<p>Myself, I&#x27;ve lost hope. My hope that &#x27;things will get better&#x27; is lost.<p>I used to believe that startups were meant to solve painful problems. But the most painful problems in the world aren&#x27;t even discussed here.<p>And I believe we can all agree, regardless of political affiliation, that the fabric of society is itself &#x27;at risk&#x27; of collapse.<p>So now, I most frequently come here for a distraction. To drown out the noise of reality with some overly complicated technical write-up, or some arm-chair theoretical physics, or plead with smart people to look deeper.<p>Today I&#x27;m here, hoping, to find a little hope.<p>Why are you here?",
