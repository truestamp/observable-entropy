      "text": "Most of my life I worked as a WordPress developer and learned a few other things in-between. WordPress was never my first choice but due to financials I needed a job quickly so, I got into this 5 years ago after completing my high schools and left college&#x2F;formal education since then.<p>Last year, I was sick of everyday customising and fixing WordPress websites. I worked as a contractor for a few companies all these years. So, In July, I left everything and started working on my personal projects. I had experience with Python and Django because I was learning this once in a month or two.<p>So, I started improving these first. I can build eCommerce level websites with django and moreover JS, JQuery (due to WordPress and all those CMS), Postgresql, mysql, and recently learning React and HTML canvas.<p>Now, the situation is I haven&#x27;t earned a single penny in last 9 months and my personal project haven&#x27;t move forward to a level or any level at all. Because everytime I deploy, I came through a post or article here and there which every time I find useful and start redevelopment from scratch and this loop is not stoping from the last 4 months especially. So, I&#x27;m only working development part but not on its business part like SEO or content.<p>And now, I&#x27;m broke as hell and not sure what should I do. Whenever I look at jobs either for backend: they need algo and for frontend they need 10 different frameworks. I don&#x27;t have any education background in CS or even in anything after high school.<p>What should I do now?<p>My overall skills: Python, Django, JS, JQuery, CMS like WordPress and Shopify, SEO, and paid ads.<p>My portfolio: 0\nAs a contractor I cannot show those websites in my portfolio and only I can tell but no one is going to listen without seeing first.<p>Should I learn a few more frameworks, languages or other thing like cloud to get a job as quickly as possible or should I just apply and these are enough?",
