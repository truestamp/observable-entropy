      "text": "I have been posting here for some time now. I post in earnest and follow post and comment guidelines.<p>I have been trying to post a singular comment replying to a comment and this is the first time that I am engaging with this comment. I’ve posted 2 other comments on this thread. Despite waiting 3 hours I’m still getting this “slow down, you are posting too fast “ message.<p>It feels like a thumb on the conversation, like a bully taunting you by holding their longer armed hand on the helpless smaller persons forehead, others are free to post and downvote, but I get to wait out an arbitrary opaque amount of time before I am a full human here.<p>Considering that the thread in question is about Facebook allowing fossil fuel industry misinformation on the climate crisis to go unchallenged despite their alleged commitment to doing something about climate change, and considering the viewpoint I advocate for, I’m not surprised that oil industry shills here downvote me. That this should handicap my voice here is a testament to the HN system. I cannot post a considered comment after 3 hours and that’s your private right as a privately owned forum, but it should be brought to your attention before I disengage with your community. It’s only the fate of humanity being decided here, no big deal.<p>I’ve enjoyed the links bad it’s just the moderation style, the much vaunted moderation style and rules that drive me away…(Lol. cue link about the lonely work of moderating HN, as i don’t reckon this post will be well received by the established HN community … sorry not sorry, I have to be real here.",
