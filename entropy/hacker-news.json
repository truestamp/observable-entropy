I am not Nice (cliche&#x27; I know), I am not positive, I am not gentle, I am not polite, I am not polished, I am not the one who takes the high road. My behaviors are not desirable, normal, common, attractive.<p>In the past, in my quest to overcome my low-self-esteem and attain confidence I did rear &quot;No More Mr Nice guy&quot; and &quot;Not Nice&quot;.  They both helped a but, but I wrongly assumed that being confident and being &quot;Nice&quot; were compatible. And they are, but not the &quot;Nice&quot; meaning that I had&#x2F;have embedded in my mind.<p>I have searched on Google and in Psychology Today about my condition. I have just bought the book &quot;Overcoming Passive Aggression&quot;.<p>Dear HN: can you give me some advice, pointers on how to embark in this battle and this journey? Hold no punches, I know I have done a lot of wrong, while thinking that I was doing good. And it sucks on so many levels.<p>Thanks in advance.",
