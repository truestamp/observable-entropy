      "text": "Sometimes when I am bored I like to pick up unknown caller&#x2F;spam calls just to see what they are peddling, and this morning I was in one of those moods. However, when I answered I was surprised to hear a real person on the other end of the line that knew my name, my employer, and my role. They were trying to sell me on their startup product which is aimed at people in my position.<p>I was quite surprised how he had all this information on me, and I asked where he got my phone number thinking perhaps we have a mutual connection that put us in touch. Instead, he said he found me and my phone number on LinkedIn. We had a bit of back-and-forth, and I politely ended the call.<p>I have double checked, and there is no phone number connected to my LinkedIn account. Instead, I suspect this seller has some sort of Chrome extension which is adding extra contact info metadata to public LinkedIn profiles. With that, a seller can look for people with my job title, and then use that contact info to do cold outreach.<p>Is that likely what happened in this case, or is there another avenue I am not considering? How might I prevent these creepy calls in the future? I suspect if there are 1-2 large players who offer this service I could ask them to delete my data. I don&#x27;t want to delete my LinkedIn account over this as I have found it relatively handy.",
