      "text": "I was frustrated with the state of tooling for working with icons on the web. You&#x27;re either forced to serve gigantic font files with more icons than you could possibly need, or you have to customize your fonts in a browser-based tool.<p>I wanted a CLI program with a simple configuration format, so that I could integrate it with my static site generator build process and version control.<p>I built fontite to fulfill that need. The linked page demonstrates how you might use it to combine icons from 7 different WOFF2 and SVG sources, and only require about 4kB to serve all of them, with no JS required!<p>I now use this on my personal website [1] and I&#x27;m very happy with it. If you&#x27;re curious, there&#x27;s more information on the GitLab repo [2] and I wrote up a summary of the making process [3] as well.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some smaller, faster websites using this tool!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antonok.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antonok.com</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;antonok&#x2F;fontite\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;antonok&#x2F;fontite</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antonok.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;fontite\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;antonok.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;fontite</a>",

      "text": "In the past 2-3 years basically every major, modern piece of software I use has added dark mode. Everything from macOS to the Google Maps app has added a dark mode, and many websites have a toggle as well. GitHub has added like 3 different dark modes!<p>If you&#x27;ve ever worked on a mobile app or website before you know that going from one theme (light mode) to two themes (light &#x2F; dark) is a huge task. You have to make all the colors in your app super generic. And it&#x27;s even harder than that, because you can&#x27;t just switch colors one-for-one. In a well-designed dark mode you have to rethink a lot of UI concepts (mostly around light, shadow, and contrast) in order to make things look nice.<p>I am not opposed to dark mode at all, I think it often looks nice, but as someone who has spent some time in big companies I am really shocked at the level of engineering resources that have been spent on this relatively frivolous feature. Most engineering teams have a huge backlog of features&#x2F;bugs to fix. Dark mode has somehow made the top of the stack.<p>So I&#x27;m asking HN. Have you worked on a major app that added dark mode? Who within your organization pushed to prioritize it? How much time did it take and was it harder&#x2F;easier than you expected?",
