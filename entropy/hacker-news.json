      "text": "Dear venerable and magnificent netizens of HN,<p>Hangouts and Gmail have been helping the billions communicate easily.<p>One thing I discovered when I started using chat in Gmail was it&#x27;s missing the stickers from hangouts. A lot of people probably think those stickers are no good. Maybe the design seems dated or not so trendy. But I think they&#x27;re awesome and I got used to using them. I really hope the makers of chat in Gmail and hangouts will bring the full set of classic stickers from hangouts to Google chat<p>They were so adorable<p>I want to go back to hangouts just for the stickers... They became part of my emotional communication language in significant relationships.... Without them in chat...I feel I can&#x27;t express what I want to show. Emojis aren&#x27;t right for everything. Those hangout stickers really hit quite a number of spots to express.<p>I hope that Google will please please please bring them to chat.<p>Look other people feel like this, here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;hangouts&#x2F;thread&#x2F;121080190&#x2F;using-stickers-from-google-hangouts-in-google-chat?hl=en<p>I know Hangouts is transitioning but I&#x27;m kind of worried when it&#x27;s going to shut down or what will not be present in the new one.
