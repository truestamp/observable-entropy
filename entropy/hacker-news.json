We&#x27;ll have meetings on zoom.\nBut thats 1 dimensional, When will all of us be again  in the same room?<p>Yes, Everyone will be gone, busy with their life, each living in different city,\nOh, I cant go on.. This disconsolateness..., Oh, what a pity.<p>But I am sure, everyone will meet again, everyone will find ways,\nTo get back together, meet, play games and talk about the good old days!!",
