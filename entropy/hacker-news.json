      "text": "Hi all,<p>I am working on a nano (pico, really) brewery project and need a bunch of custom aluminum and wood pieces for our tiny brewhouse and barroom build.<p>I have a large workspace and am considering a range of CNC machine and laser engravers. I would like a the option (or as a separate purchase) of a 4-axis tabletop rotary option to experiment with small scale laser-etching of cans as well.<p>I find my self in the modern internet dilemma of google search being almost unusable due to pages of SEO spam, while reddit is also relatively gamified in this product category as well. Youtube has a ton of content here, but it&#x27;s also now mostly a proxy for sponsor-creator view battles, and it&#x27;s tough to wade through the many, many hours of semi-honest use&#x2F;reviews when I have the day job and fam. Hackaday is great...for hacks, but not really expert reviews, and Make magazine seems to have minimal coverage here as well.<p>Where should I go to figure out how to get what I need in this space? Are there any HN users with enough experience in this domain that you can offer recommendations, search terms, or major product pitfalls to avoid? I am willing to go into the mid 4 figures for a good product(s) that can help me with both bar furniture trim, aluminum fittings, and laser engraving. Would love to learn as efficiently as I can what may suit my use cases. Thanks!",
