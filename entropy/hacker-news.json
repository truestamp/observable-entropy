There are also specific methodologies for software architecture, like creating ERDs and flowcharts. Same for the server infrastructure and persistent datastorage.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for is one tool that combines all the various domains of a piece of software with varying levels of complexity. So something that gives a full overview that also allows you to &#x27;zoom in&#x27; on specific layers for more detail.<p>Is there any tool out there that provides this level of varied complexity and global overview? Of do you use something that&#x27;s not made for it but works well?",
