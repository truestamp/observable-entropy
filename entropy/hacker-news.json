      "text": "Every Russian citizen and every Russian company that is currently relying on businesses in the West such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and so on for hosting, connectivity and services should expect those services to be cut off at some point in the near future, and plan accordingly.<p>Regardless, you won&#x27;t be able to pay for these services at the next billing period so they will be terminated one way or another.<p><i>Back up your stuff, move your service while you can or you risk losing everything</i>.<p>Understand that the level at which this is currently playing out means that it could very well happen that governments will sanction businesses in the West that continue to work with Russian entities, businesses or individuals.<p>Some may decide to do this unilaterally for reasons all their own, some may give you warnings, some won&#x27;t.<p>Use the time while you have it. And I hope sincerely that all of this will be behind us soon and in a way that minimizes bloodshed on both sides, but I <i>especially</i> wish that for the defenders, who had no agency at all.",
