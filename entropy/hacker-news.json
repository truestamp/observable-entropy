So I often have some silly(very short lived) conflicts with some of the engineers.<p>I love my job and industry, but I often have problem with my team (non programmers) and I lack &quot;emotional&quot; support form my boss(no &quot;thank you&quot; for working in weekends for example).<p>My boss refuses to talk with me about it.<p>Should I just quit?",
