      "text": "Hey HN - spending time adding machine learning to your product is almost never worth it for startups.<p>Formulating the problem, managing training data, training models, serving them, etc... for a 10% increase in some metric just isn&#x27;t worth the time. Using rules + heuristics, although not optimal, does a pretty good job for a long time.<p>There should be a better solution between rules &amp; hardcore ML -- an 80&#x2F;20 way to add ML to any product. Just slap it on top of the rules you already have, get that 10% gain, and never think about it again.<p>I built an API that does just that. It&#x27;s used by a few companies to do everything from shopping cart recommendations to personalized landing page hero text. It takes 10-20 lines of code to implement.<p>I&#x27;d love for anyone in the HN community to kick the tires on this and let me know what you think. You can even use this api key immediately without an account to test it out: 1e9d8ef7948e545d25f189addb17dae1.",
