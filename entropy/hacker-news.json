      "text": "There is something very magical about how Nintendo doesn&#x27;t focus on powerful specs as much as fun gameplay, and I remember reading about this philosophy. The systems are made from existing mass produced hardware (the Wii was basically a slightly more powerful GameCube with novel controls: the GameCube&#x27;s Gekko PowerPC Processor, a modified PPC750CXe, is only 486MHz while the Wii Broadway Power PC Processor, a close to stock PPC750CL, is 729MHz. That pegs the Wii processor at roughly 67% more powerful than the GameCube.)<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gunpei_Yokoi#Lateral_Thinking_with_Withered_Technology<p>He articulated his philosophy of &quot;Lateral Thinking of Withered Technology&quot; (枯れた技術の水平思考, &quot;Kareta Gijutsu no Suihei Shikō&quot;) (also translated as &quot;Lateral Thinking with Seasoned Technology&quot;) in the book Yokoi Gunpei Game House. &quot;Withered technology&quot; in this context refers to a mature technology which is cheap and well understood. &quot;Lateral thinking&quot; refers to finding radical new ways of using such technology. Yokoi held that toys and games do not necessarily require cutting-edge technology; novel and fun gameplay are more important. In the interview he suggested that expensive cutting-edge technology can get in the way of developing a new product.<p>Even recently the Switch was basically just an Nvidia shield. Thoughts on this, and have you seen this philosophy in use anywhere else? I see that somewhat with installing linux on buying&#x2F;using computers deemed too slow.",
