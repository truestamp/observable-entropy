      "text": "ML code generation systems like GitHub Copilot and now AlphaCode are impressive. Part of me finds them super interesting and exciting, including everything else that&#x27;s happening in the larger deep learning&#x2F;language models space.<p>However, a different part of me gets hit with a wave of anxiety whenever these advancements make the news. I&#x27;ve been coding since teenage days and will graduate in a few months. I have a job lined up and am thrilled about working there. Now it feels like I&#x27;m running against a clock until the career I am working very hard for will automate itself away.<p>Are my feelings reasonable? How do you deal with this? Do you feel threatened?",
