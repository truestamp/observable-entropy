      "text": "I&#x27;ve spent the past 2 days writing code to work with OCR results and use the position of words and sentences to link them together and classify them.<p>In the process my math knowledge has had a real workout, even though it&#x27;s 2D geometry.<p>I did undergrad physics at university 20 years ago. Since then I&#x27;ve done web programming that hasn&#x27;t needed maths and I&#x27;ve forgotten so much. Though I don&#x27;t feel I ever understood the maths properly, just enough to pass my courses.<p>Can you recommend any books or learning materials to help me get back in practice? I&#x27;m a visual learner and learn best with applied examples, which is where many of my textbooks fell down as they were too abstract. Anything that&#x27;s based on doing maths on images or something I can see and draw results on is even better.<p>I&#x27;m also looking for material that covers how you apply maths on computers. E.g. I was extrapolating a line through two points and got caught out when the gradient went to infinity (in x-y coords, a line parallel to the y-axis). I fudged it by adding a tiny amount to the denominator so it&#x27;ll never by zero, but I&#x27;d like to learn the proper way to handle these cases. \nTranslating problems into vector representations would be good too, as I tried and got lost in all the different meanings of Vector.",
