      "text": "Hi, recently I&#x27;ve been trying to self-study Computer Science. \nThe networking textbook (Computer Networking: a Top Down Approach) I&#x27;m using has a free online resource called knowledge checks (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gaia.cs.umass.edu&#x2F;kurose_ross&#x2F;knowledgechecks&#x2F;index.php) and I&#x27;m loving it &lt;3. I find it better than normal assignments due to it&#x27;s immediate feedback<p>I&#x27;m wondering if other educators make these kind of resources as well?",
