      "text": "New pandemics are a given. So I am thinking of potential defense mechanisms against new viruses.<p>If a new virus appears, how crazy would it be to quickly create a super spreading stable virus that produces no symptoms and has the same viral spike as a newly appeared virus?<p>Could that be a self-spreading vaccine that protects us from new viruses and solves the logistics of vaccines? Anti-vacs would not pose a general health risk because they&#x27;d get immunised without even noticing.<p>What are the ethical implications? How could a government even prevent other countries from developing such a protection and spreading around the world?",
