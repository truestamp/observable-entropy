      "text": "Hi,<p>Just wondering how useful it is to have pay walled content posted on Hackernews and why there is no option to see&#x2F;block it upfront?<p>More and more content behind the pay wall is posted to HN littering the section.<p>So who is doing it? Why? Getting on one&#x27;s nerves by suggestions and then hitting the pay wall makes it not more possible to get more subscription.\nI don&#x27;t even have the possibility to pay easily and if I see something interesting but paywalled, I look up Google for exact that information - and sometimes find something more interesting than this paywall providers offer.<p>So what&#x27;s the idea behind making the HN unusable in some terms<p>(Disc. No offense. I just try to understand why this is done and whether the one&#x27;s doing that is really not realizing, that doing so might have negative impact?)",
