      "text": "I&#x27;ve seen some articles lately taking about how software engineers make <i>upwards</i> of $125K in the US. That&#x27;s off by about an order of magnitude.<p>It&#x27;s really not <i>that</i> uncommon to see software engineers in the US with 3-5 years of experience making &gt;$300K--about what a doctor would make, except without having to go to school for 12 years to do so.<p>It&#x27;s kind of unfathomable why someone might choose a career in investment banking, or management consulting, or any other engineering profession, which might require very long hours, extensive certifications, hostile work environments, etc. over a career as a software engineer or product manager. That is, unless they don&#x27;t realize they can make at least as much or more in tech.",
