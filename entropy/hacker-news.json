I deeply regret it but I don&#x27;t know what to do.<p>One strategy I used was to tell her that I don&#x27;t want to have kids, and I told her it was ok if she left me. She said she was never sure about having kids either and wants to stay married.<p>I don&#x27;t want to hurt my partner, but I also don&#x27;t want to stay in the marriage. I am sure I want to break up and be single again - and very likely remain single forever, I can&#x27;t understand how many men can marry twice.<p>But how to do it? We look like the perfect couple for everyone including our in-laws.<p>Main problem is that she still depends on me financially. Am I a bad person if I keep pretending for a couple of years until she finishes her studies, gets a good job and then break up? (she is also a software dev, she is already working but earns a pretty low salary)",
