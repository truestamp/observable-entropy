      "text": "I came across a job definition today in my LinkedIn job feed. This is kind of a startup job, but the descriptions appear to be very thinly veiled from their real intentions. The lines with * are my interpretations.<p>- Those who use the word &quot;impossible&quot; are asked not to disturb those who try  \n* you will be asked to do the impossible and crazy stuff, but don&#x27;t complain\n- We don’t reinvent the wheel, others have already done it before us, so we reuse as much as possible\n* you should copy code from random github repos and complete work in 5 mins\n- Work smart, not hard\n* if you work overtime, its your fault. don&#x27;t expect compensation\n- Work should always be engaging\n* you should immerse yourself full time in work\n- We hate silos and break them with full transparency and communication\n* no clear role boundary. you need to do everything\n- We are not building tools but solutions\n* you are responsible for overall project or solution, thugh its not your role\n- We continuously improve by removing waste\n* you can be fired any time\n- We put our users first and generate value for them before all\n* you won&#x27;t be paid until our users are happy and pay us\n- We anticipate change and are adaptive\n* We don&#x27;t know what we are doing, but don&#x27;t complain\n- We focus on attention to detail and precision in everything we do\n* You don&#x27;t have scope for mistakes and corrections",

      "text": "Not that progress should be denied <i>entirely</i>, but I often think that the past gets discarded too quickly and many good ideas got lost with the bath water. I&#x27;m certainly not the only one to feel that way.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering what such good ideas that have disappeared can other HNers remember.<p>I&#x27;ll start:<p>In the golden age of sun stations, the BIOS was written in forth, and the ROM contained a forth interpreter. Not only all extension cards ROM was interpreted and therefore all extension cards were architecture independent, but you were given a Forth REPL to tinker around the boot process, or in fact at any later point once the system had started with a special key combination.<p>That was in my opinion way ahead of the modern BIOSes, even taking into account OpenBIOS.<p>Your turn?",
