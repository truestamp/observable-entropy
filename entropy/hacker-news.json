      "text": "These colors come from &quot;spiral dynamics&quot;:<p>Red - prison or mafia culture, top strong man at top and it’s kill or\nbe killed. Top guy is always being murdered every few years or decades\nand a new leader takes over. Ancient Rome was like this and eventually\npeople dislike all the murder and move into…<p>Blue - religion culture where you believe in an after life so much,\nyou limit your actions. You feel you and your group have the one truth\nabout God and you’ll be saved after death but others won’t. People get\nsick of this and move into…<p>Orange - let’s stop living for this after life and make our current\nlife here on earth really good. Maybe there is a God, maybe not but\nlet’s just not think about that too much and focus on things like\nCapitalism and making my life great. Sometimes at the expense of\nothers or the planet.\nNot everyone gets sick of this but some do and move into…<p>Green - I care deeply about all my fellow humans and the planet and\nCapitalism just isn’t cutting it anymore. Social Justice is big here\nand greens are fighting with blues over what is true. Lots of\nscientific atheists here telling blues and oranges they have it all\nwrong. But no green has the answer for what else if not Capitalism.\nThe classic liberal who is against everything but not FOR any specific\nbetter idea. Most people remain stuck here but very few move into...<p>Yellow - The first color that agrees there should be all the other\ncolors. Like a building with many floors, you can&#x27;t have the 100th\nfloor without the 99 below it and a solid foundation. A yellow person\ncan hold paradoxes. A yellow person has no ego about being right and\ntalks to the other colors in their own language. They act very blue\naround their blue friends and say all the normal blue things, but\nevery once in a while they will ask a question that gets their blue\nfriend thinking new thoughts that encourage orange. Same with their\nOrange and Green friends. They pretend they are one of them but keep\nasking those nice polite questions that help moving on. A great\nexample to know if you are yellow is dinner with your Parents. If your\nParents are blue and you are saying lots of green statements there\nwill be a fight. Vs. your yellow self wouldn&#x27;t engage in a fight.<p>So the yellow answer to what comes after Capitalism is something we\ncan&#x27;t describe yet because it&#x27;s slowly happening as more and more\npeople make it to Yellow. A society with a large yellow majority will\nfinally have a new solution.<p>15 min video here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;manage&#x2F;videos&#x2F;635476080",
