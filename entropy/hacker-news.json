      "text": "Hello HN,<p>around October last year, I started to work on campaignkit.cc as a side project. It is a service to detect invalid and malicious email addresses. You can upload text files, and use the REST API or direct integration to retrieve a detailed report for each email address.<p>End of March I added Stripe Payments and got my first paying customers via SEM.<p>A coworker suggested starting a Show HN thread, so here we are :)<p>I used golang for the backend since I wanted something lightweight with fast compilation times (coming from scala).\nFor the frontend, I&#x27;m using Next.js and TailwindUI.<p>On the further roadmap, I plan to provide more services around email deliverability. This includes Inbox placement, Backlist monitors and DMARC Analyzer.<p>Iâ€™m happy to answer questions, take criticism, and generally hear what you think.",

My super basic understanding re email this:<p>- email lives on a server\n- Gmail is the user interface for engaging with your emails\n- when you delete an email, you remove it from the UI&#x2F;Gmail platform, but not from the server<p>Am I thinking of this correctly? Is a platform like Gmail more of a way to curate your experience of what is permanently &#x2F;semipermanently(?) kept on the server?",
