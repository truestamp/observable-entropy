Mastodon is a decentralised social network, sort of like many little Facebooks linking to form the global network. Each instance is moderated by a human person and most are dedicated to a single theme, like art or music or technology. No more obscure or monopolistic rules governing your online life.<p>I&#x27;m building findmymastodon.com to help you find an instance to suit your tastes, and to try to make a tiny dent in the huge privacy &#x2F; surveillance problem.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;findmymastodon.com is far from finished, but I&#x27;m trying to drum up support for the project. Feedback, suggestions, and ideas are welcome :)<p>#tech #surveillance #mastodon #privacy #capitalism #webdev",
