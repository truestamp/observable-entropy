      "text": "I have two scenarios where I want to store certain values outside of my main database and I&#x27;m looking for a SaaS solution.<p>1: When a user joins my website, I want to show them a Welcome popup. Once they see this popup, I want to mark has_seen_welcome_popup to true. Next time they log in, I&#x27;ll know not to show it to them. This is just one example. I may want to have a dozen of these sort of values defined per user.<p>2: Let&#x27;s say I have a banner on the landing page that says &quot;40% off&quot; and I want to change that to &quot;30% off.&quot; Instead of making a code change, I want to make this change in some sort of UI in the SaaS and have it update automatically.<p>---<p>Basically just need a place to store little things that I don&#x27;t really want to store in the main database. And some nice UI where I can toggle those values as an admin without touching the prod DB.<p>My initial thought is to use Airtable but I&#x27;m not sure if there is something more purpose-built for this sort of scenario.",
