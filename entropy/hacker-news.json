      "text": "I&#x27;m only 30 but recently I&#x27;m having a severe back pain (most likely sciatica) that has affected all aspects of my life, including my job as a programmer.<p>A doctor said she wouldn&#x27;t recommend height-adjustable desks, but I don&#x27;t know of any other position&#x2F;way to write code that is easier on the back. Lying on a pillow on the bed usually reduces the pain, but it&#x27;s also harder to type things that way. I even thought about getting an iPad arm for my bed so that I can do my readings while resting on the bed, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good idea as it&#x27;d probably make the back muscles even weaker.",
