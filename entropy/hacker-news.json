      "text": "I have been lurking HN for years, sometimes submitting articles yet very rarely engaging in comments. What stops me from commenting, and from reacting to other people&#x27;s comments, is the fact that the chances of starting a conversation are so low (i.e. the person I am replying to may never know I wrote something, and if they somehow do reply I&#x27;m probably not going to see it unless I explicitly go back to check).<p>Is there anything I&#x27;m missing?",
