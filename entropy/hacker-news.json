      "text": "Good evening HN,<p>I&#x27;ve mostly ever been a lurker here.<p>I&#x27;ve had a strong suspicion for the last couple of months that Glassdoor deletes poor reviews of companies.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed multiple bad reviews from several poorly-rated companies have disappeared over the months (i.e. Amazon, Apple, etc.). Reviews that in any way, shape, or form violate the terms of condition (i.e. no swears, no identification, etc.) completely gone.<p>Recently two of my most recent reviews were also removed inexplicably. I&#x27;ve tried to contact support to no avail. They are not answering me. I was truly curious as to how they were removed. The only thing they had in common is they were reviews of bad experiences (2-star and 1-star experiences).<p>Now of course I can google and find a few stories here and there, but I wanted the opinions of the tech community that would have a cooler head and possibly be knowledgeable of Glassdoor.",
