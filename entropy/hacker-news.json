      "text": "Does anyone have a recommendation for a reliable, trustworthy company that offers Seafile hosting? I see lots of results on DDG, but I&#x27;d appreciate some first-hand experience reports. Even better if you&#x27;ve used it for business purposes, and not just for personal files.<p>For example, I found one company that has a really slick-looking site and claims to use &quot;military-grade&quot; security, but doesn&#x27;t even support HTTPS on their website! That does not inspire confidence.",
