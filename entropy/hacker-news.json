      "text": "I&#x27;m one of those insufferable Linux nerds who went to Linux early in life after getting fed up with Windows. People said the grass was greener on the other side, and IMO they were right!<p>But I&#x27;ve heard tell of fields of <i>even greener grass</i>, all descendants of a mythical &quot;BSD&quot;.<p>But I&#x27;m wondering if that grass is greener only in theory. Are these tales of verdant fields true? I don&#x27;t have the same amount of free-time to tinker that I had when I first tried Linux, but I have the same curiosity.<p>So, to my question: Does anyone here use BSD in any &#x27;real&#x27; capacity? Say, as a personal desktop or a server or an embedded system?",
