      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a heavy Stripe user since 2013 and as a developer, love them. My day job (roughly 4M a week in volume across the platofrm) and my own saas (targeted at wrestling clubs) both run through Stripe Connect.<p>However, in the last six months or so I&#x27;ve been getting huge blow back from paying customers because of how badly their customer support is performing these days. So much blow back that some customers have left the software, because they refuse to work with Stripe anymore (and we don&#x27;t integrate with anyone else).<p>So... what are marketplaces using these days? Our platforms run Stripe Connect with standard accounts. Something like that is preferred, but it&#x27;s not required.<p>My list so far to research is:<p>- Adyen<p>- Braintree<p>- Go Cardless (not sure if they have marketplace features)<p>- Checkout.com<p>- First Data (not clear if they have marketplace features)<p>Anyone have experience or recommendations?",
