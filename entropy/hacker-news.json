      "text": "I&#x27;m a staff engineer with almost 10 years of experience working on projects that successfully saved 500k+ dollars annually. Last week I finished interviews with a well-known tech company that I would love to work for. The problem is that they made me a really low offer (45k annually) because I live in a &quot;low-cost country&quot;. I am currently making double than that and I even have another offer for 10% more than my current salary.<p>The position is for senior IC and I would love to work there because the work is super interesting and would look very well in my resume. However, the company says they can&#x27;t pay more in my country even though there&#x27;s no single employee here and they pay higher salaries in other places. What is the best strategy to convince them to pay what I think I&#x27;m worth?",
