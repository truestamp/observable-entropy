      "text": "To try and simplify the privacy story on my static webpage (hosted on a shared DreamHost server), I tried disabling IP address logging on Apache HTTP access logs. After failing to figure out how, I filed a customer support ticket and received this answer:<p>- - -<p>Thank you for contacting DreamHost Support! I’ll be happy to help today!<p>I&#x27;m afraid that on Shared Hosting it is not possible to do that, nor on\nthe VPS, as it is also a form of shared hosting, albeit more isolated and robust.<p>You could do it with a Dedicated server or our economical cloud solution, DreamCompute.  You can find out more about these here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dreamhost.com&#x2F;hosting<p>We are here to help 24&#x2F;7.",
