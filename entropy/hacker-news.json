      "text": "Hi everybody! Today I launched arbington.com, a new learning website that&#x27;s affordable and treats the content creators better than other leading platforms (as in we share much more profit than our competitors and communicate with them regularly).<p>I&#x27;ve taught somewhere around a half million people how to code over the last 10 years on various platforms, and I think it&#x27;s time to support our content creators better!<p>I personally coded about 98% of this website using Django, Postgres and Tailwind CSS and we spent the last 4-5 months talking with over 200 instructors to get this off the ground, and ended up launching today with just over 1,200 available courses.<p>Now the hard part: I&#x27;m looking for feedback, namely UX feedback (I know the design is still a bit rough around the edges, it&#x27;s a never ending work in progress). Is there anything feels &quot;off&quot; or flows in an awkward direction? Any free tips or tricks from the community that could help us grow in the right direction would be absolutely amazing!<p>We did a little bit of user testing already and have some good feedback coming in, but I thought: hey the best place to ask for feedback is probably from people in a similar field - Hacker News!<p>Or if people have questions about the tech stack, how it works, etc. I&#x27;m always happy to talk tech with people!",
