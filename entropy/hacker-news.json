      "text": "Hello all,<p><pre><code>  I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of interest in work orchestration frameworks, and thought I&#x27;d show off my own take. It&#x27;s the project I&#x27;ve used to learn rust (entire project is async rust using tokio and actix), but it&#x27;s been really useful for my main work, too.\n\n  Daggyr is an engine for executing tasks as quickly as possible. It can run tasks on flexible back-ends (slurm, local threads, etc), and report updates &#x2F; events to trackers (currently only in-memory, working on postgres and mongodb).\n\n  There&#x27;s no UI, just a REST interface. It doesn&#x27;t do scheduling (there are tons of tools for that). It doesn&#x27;t currently have multiple users &#x2F; auth, but I&#x27;m working on that.\n\n  It does support pipelines defined in JSON, task parameterization, a very simple and fast REST interface for job submission and tracking, and resuming failed runs from where they left off.\n\n  Why another one of these things?\n</code></pre>\n1. I couldn&#x27;t get behind Airflow&#x27;s weird scheduling opinions.<p>2. Dagster, Airflow, and Prefect rely on tight integration with python. A lot of my work flows are calling custom binaries, so python provides no value, and it&#x27;s also a barrier to defining jobs.<p>3. Daggyr can scale to pipelines of hundreds of thousands of tasks.<p>4. Daggyr is stupidly simple to run: no external services or dependencies (unless you want them). Simple run the binary and send some work.<p><pre><code>  Long story short, it does what it says on the tin, but there&#x27;s more work to be done. I&#x27;d really appreciate any feedback. No idea if I&#x27;m going to try and commercialize it, but if you&#x27;d like to see  a feature ASAP, I&#x27;m always open to sponsored feature development!\n</code></pre>\nedit: formatting",
