      "text": "Hi HN!<p>I&#x27;ve gotten a bit frustrated by going to `datadog.com` instead of `app.datadog.com`. I know that I could use a chrome extension to do this redirect for me (I do). But since this is a painful UX, I think that SaaS companies should do something to improve it for all of their users.<p>So I made `marketing-redirect`, a quick bit of HTML to put on a marketing page that lets customers get automatically redirected to the application they&#x27;re already paying for:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;elliotaplant&#x2F;marketing-redirect<p>You can see an example of it in action here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elliotplant.com&#x2F;marketing-redirect&#x2F;<p>Aside from just making the tools I use better, I&#x27;m brainstorming ways to monetize this. My best idea is to create a cloud service the help marketing teams remove or tag the page views from paying customers who visit their marketing page so their analytics software can exclude them as possible leads. I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback.<p>Thanks,<p>Elliot",

I raised this with my manager and they have delegated complete responsibility to myself, which I am pleased about, however I don&#x27;t have a huge amount of experience as an interviewer, although I have done government training to be an interviewer (anti-bais, score cards).\nThe type of role is a Data Engineer favouring the profile of a Software Engineers in the data space.\nWhat advice can you offer?
