Do you follow specific metrics (DORA metrics, …) or framework (SPACE, …)? I’m particularly interested in helping engineers that start management positions without much experience.<p>Main takeaways we’ve seen so far: following key metrics to assess engineering sprints&#x27; health, regularly sending anonymous surveys to engineers for feedback, creating dedicated timeslots for engineering managers to work on non-direct tech topics (hiring, management, …).",

Current process is manual - just remember the programs I need&#x2F;use&#x2F;want then download and install one by one. It&#x27;s tedious as you can imagine.<p>Are there any projects out there that ease this process? Ninite is pretty slick but the list of software is slim. Trying to find a better way to automate this task and looking to this group to crowdsource answers.<p>Thanks!",
