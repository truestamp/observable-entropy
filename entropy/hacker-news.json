      "text": "Terminals are great, text input -&gt; text output.<p>Terminals are not so visual, and any advance input can be complicated to remember or even type (see input to ffmpeg).<p>However I feel websites that are used heavily like for customer support teams, that continuously does the same actions, but a wide range of them, could benefit of being able to control more of a website with keyboards.<p>I think the best example of a keyboard focus website is linear.app, but even that has two types of search (shift + &#x2F; and CMD + K)\nAnd it shows keyboard shortcuts on mouse over.<p>However,\nclicking the right and left arrow does not move between the main area and the sidebar.\nOnly clicking up and down arrow changes between the active row currently selected.<p>I know of Vimium for Chrome, which allows you to press F and then the letter for clicking a link.<p>However, what happend to those terminals that were focus heavily on the arrow keys to quickly navigate? Those old terminals? Like the current &quot;raspi-config&quot; we have.<p>Obviously it is pretty hard to navigate with a keyboard on mobile, but &quot;mobile first&quot; does dictate a design that is very narrow and would fit a keyboard navigation.\nIt is funny to see how all cloud providers has a Cloud Shell.<p>Have we decided that navigating with mouse is the best interface?",
