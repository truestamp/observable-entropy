      "text": "Hey everyone. It might be nostalgia talking, but when I was a little kid I remember going to a store, finding a fascinating book on 3D game programming ( I think it was trying to do a Wolfenstein clone ) and not buying it ( it was ridiculously expensive at the time -- way more than I had saved ). Feels like a missed opportunity today.<p>Anyway, for the life of me, I do not remember anything other than it was C++, it was 90s, it was about making a 3d shooter clone game.<p>I tried Amazon, but nothing I found seems to match the memory. Does anyone may have an idea what the book title&#x2F;author was&#x2F;could be?",
