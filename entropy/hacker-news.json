      "text": "Historically, Americans are much more active on financial markets compared to the inhabitants of Europe. At one point in time more than 70% of American households were owners of publicly traded companies, while for European households that number would come in a single digit(!).<p>So it’s not surprising that most pronounced advances in retail stock and option brokerage took place in the US rather than Europe. For example, as of 2020 Robinhood had 13m retail traders, while Flatex-Degiro (major EU retail brokerage firm) in 2020 had only 1.2m users.<p>On the other hand, when we talk about sports betting Europe is well ahead of the United States. For 2019 sports trading revenue in the US is 0.9b USD. Below there is a table with revenue numbers per state from June, 2018 till February, 2021. As can be seen, sports betting in some states is even illegal.<p>Jurisdiction Revenue<p>Arkansas       $5,642,181<p>Colorado       $75,841,206<p>Delaware       $52,298,447<p>Illinois       $101,621,640<p>Indiana        $209,366,110<p>Iowa           $72,256,247<p>Michigan       $22,339,974<p>Mississippi    $103,368,568<p>Montana        $ -<p>Nevada         $786,308,000<p>New Hampshire  $23,682,372<p>New Jersey     $791,869,724<p>New Mexico     $ -<p>New York       $18,552,162<p>Oregon         $26,869,312<p>Pennsylvania   $384,151,235<p>Rhode Island   $42,905,081<p>Tennessee      $27,144,908<p>Washington DC  $14,461,585<p>West Virginia  $58,188,453<p>Total          $2,816,867,205<p>European Union (including the UK) sports betting revenue came in 2019 at 10b EUR, which is much higher than in the US even after adjusting for the population difference.
