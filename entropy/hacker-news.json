      "text": "I studied electrical engineering in college. I&#x27;m finishing grad school now. My work for the past several years has been at the intersection of classical control and machine learning. More of the latter, actually.<p>I can pick up new, and maintain old &quot;soft&quot;-ware skills (programming languages, algorithms etc.) pretty much by reading online and running demos on a computer. I feel like I can keep abreast of latest skills needed to hire a software engineer.<p>How do I do the same with &quot;hard&quot;-ware skills? I studied VLSI design, circuits, and embedded systems programming in college. Many of these require expensive software or bespoke apparatus or a longer setup. Unsurprisingly, they do not have the same amount of flashy online demos that more web-dev-adjacent fields like CS have.<p>This question was prompted by the recent article here[1] talking about the decline in EE graduates over time, in favor of more software-oriented fields.<p>Any time-tested advice?<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32142711",

      "text": "I last interviewed almost five years ago and at the time I was mostly asked leet code in the interview portions. I’m interviewing again now and it seems nearly every company I’m talking to has a system architecture question as part of the screen (in some cases one ML system and one Software system).  I’m generally good at architecture but I’m used to solving these problems over long time horizons by doing detailed research. Are there any good resources or practice problems for doing these in 45 minute spitball sessions? I think it’s a dramatically different skill from regular system design and I’m not entirely sure how to approach it. I also would like to practice a wider variety of systems because my personal experience is a bit heavy on mobile and I feel I’m likely to get asked mostly server specific questions.",
