      "text": "I have come to realise that, well most large businesses don&#x27;t actually know what&#x27;s going on inside them.  And when they do try to map it out they end up with &quot;human level understanding&quot; - that is the chunks are big enough to fit in a spreadsheet or a human mind.<p>And those chunks tend not to be meaningful to the people actually working on them (ie no one works in a black  box - we actually know what all the cogs and gears do)<p>So there is a disconnect between the people &quot;at the top&quot; and the people &quot;on the ground&quot;<p>This is fairly obvious but one advantage of a micro-service might be that it is meaningful at the ground level but it is also a discrete chunk that has to be mapped and handled at the &quot;top&quot; level.<p>In other words, will micro-services allow businesses to map their own internal workings <i>from</i> the code, not despite the code?",
