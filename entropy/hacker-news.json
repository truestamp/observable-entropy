      "text": "I&#x27;m in an interesting situation and would like to know about what others who have faced the same situation have done in the past.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the market for a new job since spring. At the beginning, I was only focused on products I really liked to (in summary, what a futurist engineer geek would like to: AI, blockchain, security, etc). I had several interviews, but no one struck a deal, either because they decided to move on with other candidates or because I decided to drop off.<p>Fast forward to mid September, I decided to start applying to positions that suit my role and&#x2F;or career progression, but in less appealing companies. And I have been very successful. The minimum offer I have received doubles my current salary.<p>So, I&#x27;m in this situation in which I have offers which look positive from a financial and career progression point of view, but in boring products which not interest me at all and which have no upside at all.<p>Have you ever been in that position? What did you do?",
