      "text": "Hello,<p>This is an odd request but back around 2016-2017 I frequently used a specific website for tracking my weight. This website was recommended by someone on HN, and I remember the following distinctive details about it:<p>- It was started by the technical cofounder of a company that has since become an entrenched BigCo during the Dotcom era.<p>- The site creator chose to go with a mostly basic HTML layout without the use of many dependencies.<p>- The site&#x27;s primary colors were I believe white and a shade of purple.<p>- It contained a very helpful chart which plotted out your average weight given a rolling past ten days of data.<p>- I think the name of the website was something along the lines of &quot;The Programmer&#x27;s Exercise Guide&quot; but I vaguely recall the domain being the creator&#x27;s name or abbreviation of it.<p>The site was very helpful and I would love to remember what it is again (and to bookmark it this time!). I have combed through my entire password manager and bookmarks list, but have come up short with anything that would have matched what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>Anyone have a guess?",
