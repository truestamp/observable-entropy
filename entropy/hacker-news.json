      "text": "Say you have the following requirements:<p>- A JSON api that returns a bunch of date-based data, that refreshes daily<p>- Represent some of that data in some time series line graphs<p>- Display those graphs on a web page that other people can access, so that the data is up to date when they visit<p>- free, or free for low traffic<p>What are some of the fastest ways to set this up? I&#x27;m personally trying to set up a covid dashboard specific to my area, for my friends and I to check daily. So far I&#x27;ve tried Google Data Studio hooked up to a Google Sheet that refreshes periodically, but Data Studio is broken half the time. I also have the capability to set up a whole Next.JS website that caches data but that&#x27;s overkill in terms of time&#x2F;effort.<p>Other things I&#x27;ve considered:<p>- jupyter but the html export is confusing and not dynamic, I think.<p>- observerablehq but that could also look kind of messy<p>- idyll-lang pushed to github pages, but I wonder if there&#x27;s something faster&#x2F;no-code.",

      "text": "Hi, just wondering what everyone here thinks about this. What should Realtor Joe do to help his family member save money?<p>SITUATION<p>Realtor named Joe is helping a family member with buying a home. They are in the middle of negotiating the purchase price. The price will make or break the deal.\nThe commission (paid by the seller) will be split 50&#x2F;50 between the listing agent (seller’s broker) and the selling agent (the Realtor that brought the buyer in this case) at closing.<p>JOE’S 2 IDEAS<p>1. Joe SHOULD tell the listing broker that he is willing to give up his share of the commission. In other words, the listing broker will not have to split the commission at closing, since he is giving up his buyer to the listing broker.<p>He understands that the Realtors&#x27; job is to work in the best interest of the clients. The listing broker can and should pass on this savings to the seller.<p>2. Joe SHOULD NOT give up his share of the commission.<p>THE GOAL &#x2F; THE QUESTION<p>Which way will help the buyer (Joe’s family member) save the most money?",
