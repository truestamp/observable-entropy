      "text": " I have worked as a tech lead at a startup for just over 2 years now. The product is targeting the enterprise space and we&#x27;ve been in talks with clients since I joined but haven&#x27;t had a paid pilot project yet. Clients put us through their preferred supplier programs and audits, but nothing comes of it. We&#x27;ve won lots of awards, we&#x27;ve been on accelerators&#x2F;incubators run by potential clients, we&#x27;re &quot;in the process&quot; with pretty much all the big players.\nWe&#x27;ve recently raised more funds and are growing the team. Investors seem to have faith, even though we&#x27;re pre-revenue, but frankly I&#x27;m less optimistic.<p>I feel like we&#x27;re building something no one may ever use. We don&#x27;t have users for the product we&#x27;re monetising and there isn&#x27;t much in-house industry knowledge, so we may be building something no one wants. We could remain in the sales process forever. This is really demotivating and I&#x27;m not the only one who feels so. After the fundraising, we&#x27;re trying to grow the team but it feels surreal building and growing this system that no one is using.<p>Has anyone been in a similar situation? I am thinking about jumping ship, but I feel some guilt as my leaving would be a big blow to the company. The equity I have would barely compensate me for the reduced startup salary over 3-4 years and that&#x27;s if we exit.",
