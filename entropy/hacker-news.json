      "text": "Since the introduction of USB-C, I have looked for the USB-C analog of the venerable USB-A hub:  multiple expansion ports with a single connector back to the host computer.<p>My application is being able to plug in multiple USB devices with USB-C cables. I can find guns with USB-C to multiple USB-A ports, but then I lose the benefit of being able to plug in the connector on the first try, without trying three orientations.<p>The only USB-C &quot;hubs&quot; I can find are expensive docking stations that have Ethernet, HDMI, etc. but do not significantly expand the number of USB-C ports.<p>Is there a technical reason for this, or is it just a product marketing choice by manufacturers?",

      "text": "I was searching some way to publicize my blog article. I was searching a simple solution, not necessary free, to integrate with social media.\nIn the past days I tried Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate and IFTTT (f this, then that).<p>My budget is around 5 euros&#x2F;month given the simple task (I could be able to do it on myself but I will need to register on the various services my library, be careful not to get banned etc).\nSo a ready-made solution seems a good idea.<p>I am not an expert on this field but I was shocked by the cost of Zapier and Power Automate, given the complexity to do simple things like publicizing posts or creating keyword alert.<p>I know they are complex tools but...<p>IFTTT seems more focused, easy to use and cheap so the question is: what do you suggest for this task?<p>There is some open source library I can mock or IFTTT is a good candidate?\nDid I miss some other option?\nThank you!",
