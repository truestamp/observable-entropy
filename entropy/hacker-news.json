From my company experience, potential customers who have not responded by phone or email are often answered via WhatsApp.",

      "text": "So yesterday I announced to launch of Microsponsor here on Hacker News.<p>And it&#x27;s been just 24 hours and I have got 3 signup and one creator actually submitted his newsletter to the marketplace!<p>How did I find my first users?<p>Finding the first real users can be very difficult, especially for a 19 year old like me with no network whatsoever. So, I decided to go with cold emails.<p>The good thing here is that my competitors have few good newsletters already submitted. So, I just contacted these writers either through the contact form on their website or through their publicly available email. And fortunately, one of them actually submitted his newsletter!<p>I know that cold emailing is not scalable, but in my opinion it can be a good way for acquiring your first few users.<p>Do you have any suggestions on how I can approach user acquisition? Let me know in the comments, I would love to hear from you<p>Shameless plug -<p>1. If you happen to be a newsletter writer, please consider submitting your amazing newsletter to Microsponsor<p>2. If you are a founder or brand looking to collaborate with creators, consider joining the waitlist (launching soon!). We take no commission<p>Know more here =&gt; microsponsor.co<p>Thanks!",
