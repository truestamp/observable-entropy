      "text": "I am developing a responsive web app that has a commenting system. And I want to provide similar experience both to mobile and desktop users. So I was thinking of developing a commenting system where next level of comments are reached by clicking on a comment at current level. Something like the following:<p>[content]\n&lt;comments at top level (level 0)&gt;\n[comment #0]\n[comment #1]\n:\n:\n[comment #N]<p>When a user clicks on one of the comments, say &quot;comment #1&quot; then the next level of comments(i.e child comments of comment #1) are displayed as follows:<p>[content]\n[comment #1]\n&lt;child comments(level 1) for comment #1&gt;\n[comment #10]\n[comment #11]\n:\n:\n[comment #1N]<p>Do you see any problem with this approach? Is there a better way to display nested comments in a responsive web app that works both on desktop and mobile?",
