      "text": "I used to have better time googling in the past. I struggle to find things I remember finding in the past using google. I think I might be stuck in some old habits of googling and I&#x27;ve lost touch with modern google.<p>For example, google seems to want full sentences instead of just keywords now. &quot;How do I do X?&quot; seems to get me better(?) results then &quot;X + some relevant keyword&quot;. But I can&#x27;t seem to get past this &quot;most popular responses&quot; google things I need. I do appreciate youtube videos marked at certain times but watching video isn&#x27;t always what I want to do.\nTangentially, has youtube search been integrated to youtube search or something now? I used to be able to search obscure music in youtube. &quot;Sal dulu a&quot; would both recommend &quot;Sal dulu antasma&quot; and list it but now unless i search for that particularly, it doesn&#x27;t show up.<p>Any pro tips on how to google (or use search engines) like a modern human would be appreciated. Or modern version of google dorking (which also seems to not work like it used to for me). Thank you.",
