      "text": "I&#x27;ve been working on a Type Theory and Haskell book using leanpub, as well as using Medium for sharing insights around similar topics as well as some light Category Theory, and got frustrated by the lack of a platform that works well for code and math articles.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if there was a niche, STEM-focused platform that provided similar &quot;writing without distraction&quot; as well as very nice reading and discovery experience as Medium, but with full math support via latex, better code highlighting, potentially better diagrams (for Category theory etc)?<p>We just wanted to pick the brain of the community as we have a small team that&#x27;s interested in building such a platform -- so any feedback would be invaluable. Thanks a lot!",

I&#x27;ve been looking for easy to understand example code, a pretty printer in Scheme or Lisp that I could adapt and extend but so far have only found academic overview papers from the 80s. It doesn&#x27;t help that most of the stuff is for CommonLisp and uses format. I don&#x27;t have any special string formatting directives and my Lisp is rather different from CL, more akin to XLisp.<p>Do any gray-bearded Lisp programmers remember some old Lisp or Scheme example code that I could study?",
