Not so easy if you are pale and pudgy. Hair loss is natural and there are millions of people with more important problems in the world... I know, I know. But still. I get envious when I see men in their 60&#x27;s or 70&#x27;s that have full hair that is not even thinning. I catch myself comparing my hair with other balding men. To see who is &quot;furthest&quot; or who has lost the most. Sometimes I wish I had lost it in my early 20&#x27;s like my brothers cause then it wouldn&#x27;t have become part of my identity. I liked having hair.<p>Prescriptions or miracle cures that actually work? Affordable hair transplants? Maybe I can&#x27;t except much as I&#x27;m over 40...",
