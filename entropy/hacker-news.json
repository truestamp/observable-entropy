      "text": "Hey HN, I&#x27;ve been developing hardware products with stm32&#x27;s using Rust. \nI&#x27;m starting to look at tests to prevent regression issues and stabilize firmware releases but integration testing with embedded seems quite difficult.<p>What is currently available for embedded testing, both in the C&#x2F;++ and Rust worlds? What are current industry standards surrounding this?<p>In the past I&#x27;ve seen proprietary simulators built (obviously with their own shortcomings), this would allow integration tests on simulated hardware. Are there any initiatives happening to standardize this in the Rust world?<p>Thanks",
