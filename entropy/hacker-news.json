      "text": "I know the best mitigation for ransomware is to maintain off-site backups.  I cannot do this.  It is a design requirement not to have offline storage.<p>What are some ways you have prepared for ransomware?<p>I&#x27;ve thought about:<p>1) udev rules that blacklist drives until the infrequent moments I do full backups<p>2) a &quot;USB condom&quot; of sorts that I can remotely disconnect (sever the 5V line), to make a USB spinning HD available as needed with an authentication scheme<p>3) running a program that tries to detect ransomware execution (antivirus or excessive cpu usage&#x2F;encryption&#x2F;etc)<p>4) mirror it to the cloud (unworkable, considering it&#x27;s 16TB)<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a solution as good as offsite backups.  Most of these are ideas that add indirection or complexity that common ransomware wouldn&#x27;t be coded for.<p>How do you disconnect a drive without disconnecting it?  Especially nvme rather than a USB enclosure?<p>What is your creative solution?",
