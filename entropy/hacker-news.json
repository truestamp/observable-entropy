Whenever you need to sign-in, scan the QR code displayed on the website from my authenticator app.\n3. Enter your device pin or use TouchId&#x2F;FaceId and you will be logged in on the website.<p>My service will manage the generation of the QR codes, the authenticator app, etc. I also think 2FA will not be needed when using this as my authenticator app will check two factors -\n1. If the request is being made from the device which the users posses.\n2. The passcode&#x2F;biometrics of the phone.<p>I think my service will be really useful for no-code&#x2F;low code websites as well as websites which do not have a native mobile app. Please let me know what you think about this idea.<p>PS - I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s ok to post this on HN, please let me know if it&#x27;s not ok and I&#x27;ll take it down.",
