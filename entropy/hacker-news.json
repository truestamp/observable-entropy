Since then I studied something different and worked many years in healthcare. But I kept my interest in IT. \nToday I have several servers, both at home and in the cloud. I run Kubernetes, Ceph and have become quiet comfortable with that. I&#x27;m not a programmer although I usually can read code and adjust it to my needs. I&#x27;m more at home in the shell (bash, zsh) and have written a few scripts to automate stuff. And now I also have some experience in container orchestration (read kubectl and manifests).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I expect from you guys. Maybe just some free associations on my thing.",
