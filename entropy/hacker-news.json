      "text": "I&#x27;ve got 7 years of experience as a learning designer, specializing in self-education.<p>Here&#x27;s the thought. I have needed elements for learning a skill, what I call &quot;the fundamentals of meta-learning,&quot; and I use them to create new ways to teach. For the next 3 months, I&#x27;d like to teach a course around them. They will help you learn skills faster and teach others better.<p>The course will include theory and practice. The theory consists of necessary conditions for learning a skill, backed with academic evidence. The practice may be students teaching or learning a skill of their choosing, with regular feedback sessions.<p>Here&#x27;s a full proposal. Please read it! There&#x27;s crucial info inside that will help you decide if it&#x27;s worth it, including a proof of concept and how I plan to finance the project.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1Vd8AMOZrQUHsK5NVj05qPUa7cG6jOCnGdSUTXBX7Dfo&#x2F;edit?usp=sharing<p>Thanks, lmk how it goes.",
