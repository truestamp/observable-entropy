      "text": "Just wondering how other open-source developers deal with valid by badly-written pull requests.<p>I usually work closely with the PR author, giving them multiple rounds of suggestions until it&#x27;s up to our project&#x27;s coding standards. Sometimes the PR author &quot;drops out&quot; of the process in frustration, as they were just trying to give us a quick fix, and didn&#x27;t necessarily want to do a lot of work. In those cases, I usually thank them, and rewrite the PR (or heavily modify it). But I&#x27;m hesitant to do this in all cases, because often the PR author is excited to see their name as part of the contributors list, and&#x2F;or to see their own code used in the project.<p>How so you deal with this kind of thing?",
