If you get a green &quot;Domain Available&quot;, it&#x27;s probably you made a typo or your cat was walking on your keyboard while you were busy typing..<p>So, from a &quot;business&#x2F;brand-awareness&quot; perspective, does still the dot com TLD make a big difference compared to other less-attractive TLDs? I think this should have a different answer for website-based businesses and mobile-app-based (where most apps may ONLY need a domain name for consuming APIs?), PWA is another case in the middle?<p>Let&#x27;s take for example some famous&#x2F;successful services which are not .COMed, eg; &quot;zoom.us&quot;, &quot;notion.so&quot;, &quot;telegram.org&quot;..etc, Do you think people still notice or care about these services not being &quot;.com&quot; (although the first two already own their .com TLD).<p>What are good alternatives: &quot;.io&quot;,&quot;.ai&quot; for techy startups, &quot;.app&quot; for mobile apps &amp; PWA? What about so-called &quot;domain hacks&quot; where you can read the full name of your brand when adding the appropriate TLD, eg: &quot;youtu.be&quot;, &quot;instagr.am&quot;, &quot;every.one&quot;, &quot;del.icio.us&quot;.",
