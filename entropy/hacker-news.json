      "text": "The EU Commission is proposing to mandate member state wide education (read school curricula) in climate-sustainability (see here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;education.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;focus-topics&#x2F;green&#x2F;education-for-environmental-sustainability  and here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;education.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;tr&#x2F;node&#x2F;1895<p>We have a vivid history of pounding ideological dogmas into kid&#x27;s heads (Hitler Jugend was one such program, and Marxists-Leninist in recent history). Both ended up not only in socio-economic disasters, but brought destruction and untold pains to the masses, and turned (necessarily) into murderous doctrines at the end. I do not see this ending up any different (especially reading these mediocre-bureaucratic documents outlining a policy), and the fact that due to &quot;green actions&quot; at EU level are expected to send 1&#x2F;4 of populace into poverty (by their own study). Who is behind such evilness? What is the need for this? If there is a need, is this really best strategy? Can this be even implemented in non-harmful way? Why appeal to emotions in any and all such debates, even in official policy documents such as these? How can one fight such proposal of despair, fear, hate and passivity toward humanity? Why is there no outcry when we are about to repeat the shameful history yet again? [ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qxZfSlkC_wo ]",
