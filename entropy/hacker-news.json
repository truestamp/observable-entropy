      "text": "I received an email below about pretending to be another developer which sounded interesting.<p>&quot;Our team members live in the U.S, but originally from Europe. All of us are talented and experienced developers. But they donâ€™t have a native English speaking level. So we have a big bottleneck during the interview with the clients for their projects.. We need someone to talk natively in English instead of our members. I want you to help me.<p>Your Role:\nSo your role is to do the call with clients by using our team member&#x27;s name, their skills, and experiences. This is not a representative position. You should &quot;pretend&quot; like him during the interview only.<p>You will have 3~5 interviews with different clients every day and normally each interview will take 30~60 minutes. Of course, we will send all information for you to refer to before the call. You can refer to it before and during the call.\nYou will need to record the interview, we will compensate for your service based on interview hours.<p>We are already working with some collaborators in the same position, but we need 1 person more.\nPlease feel free to message me if you are interested in this role.&quot;<p>Has anyone had experience with fake interviewees&#x2F;new hires? I wonder how widespread this problem is.",
