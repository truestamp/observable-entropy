The company is now profitable and has a decent war chest - employees hold options&#x2F;common stock and they&#x27;re now worth $$$$ - with the recent MEGA fundraising, employees have the opportunity to purchase preferred stock, same price as the most recent fundraising - if IPO&#x27;d, there&#x27;s a 9 month cliff from selling.<p>Is this a common practice? What are the benefits of purchasing preferred stocks, given I have commons? What else to look for? And what would you do as an employee in this instance?",
