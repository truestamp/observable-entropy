I&#x27;ve never finished my degree, and I always felt that I&#x27;m missing something in my career because of that. \nI&#x27;ve decided to go and get a one from The Open University which contains Math, Stats, Algorithms, and some Data Science modules. I have always been interested in cryptography and NLP, and tried to learn something on my own, but never make it, because of the &quot;hard math&quot;. \nAlso, trying to learn math on my own by MOOCS and books also didn&#x27;t bring any results.<p>And now I&#x27;m wondering, is this commitment really worth it? It will take ~6 years and $25k to complete it. Can I benefit from it in the future, or it would be better to try approach self-study again?",
