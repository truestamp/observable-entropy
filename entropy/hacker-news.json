      "text": "Hi HN!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a code review app for GitHub called Crocodile for about a year. I used to work at Microsoft where we used a tool called CodeFlow for reviewing code and I missed it after I left. I know many other ex-Microsoft engineers feel the same. Here are some of the distinguishing features of Crocodile that are inspired by CodeFlow:<p>* Comments float above the code instead of being inline. Long discussions that are displayed inline make it really hard to review the code.\n* Comment on any text selection in the file, even a single character.\n* Comments don&#x27;t get lost when code changes. I hate it when comments become &quot;outdated&quot; because I rebase or the line is edited.<p>I also implemented lots of features that I wish CodeFlow had which you can read more about on the blog. [1]<p>For those curious about the tech stack: it&#x27;s mostly written in Go with Alpine.js, HTMX, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. For storage I use PostgreSQL, S3 compatible object storage, and Redis for caching. I use Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning and Kubernetes deployments. Everything is hosted on DigitalOcean.<p>Feedback is welcome!<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crocodile.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-crocodile\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crocodile.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-crocodile</a>",
