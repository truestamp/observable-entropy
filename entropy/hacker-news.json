      "text": "We have a small team (5). I&#x27;m the developer and the others are mostly non-technical.<p>I&#x27;ve been writing technical documentation with MKDocs which is great as a developer comfortable with Git and Markdown, but I now want to create a separate documentation set for client-facing, help&#x2F;guide material that the other team members can contribute to.<p>Currently we just manage a Google Drive of docs and PDFs and it&#x27;s disorganised and hard to manage.<p>What are other small teams using here? I&#x27;m looking for something that has some sort of editing interface, ideally can still track versioning of content, and is themeable to some extent. It could be self-hosted or a regular hosted SAAS.<p>What are some options?",
