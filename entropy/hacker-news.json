      "text": "Firstly, I&#x27;m a big fan of Inbox Zero and have religiously pruned my Inbox such that it doesn&#x27;t get overflown as much anymore, yet there are still emails seeping in from all directions, most of which don&#x27;t have an &#x27;unsubscribe&#x27; option. They are mostly Bacn[0] and half-way between spam and something useful I need to know.<p>Like for example, Paypal <i>loves</i> to tell me I removed a card from my account, but there&#x27;s no way to turn that off in their dashboard. They just fire off every activity I&#x27;ve made with no option to <i>stop</i> these cruft emails from accumulating. Now multiply that same situation to 100x services I&#x27;ve created with my account and you have a big problem.<p>I recently heard Mozilla are offering a throwaway&#x2F;disposable email service for $1.00&#x2F;month and I&#x27;m excited for that and might try it, but I often want emails tied to <i>my</i> account and not some proxy service that could shut down at any moment and prevent me from doing password resets or reclaiming my account!<p>How are you people coping with an overflowing Inbox, what&#x27;s your strategy?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urbandictionary.com&#x2F;define.php?term=bacn",
