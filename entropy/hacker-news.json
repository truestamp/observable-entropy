      "text": "Intuit, the owner of TurboTax is one of the largest players in tax e-filing. How do they seem to employ so many dark patterns with little complaint from consumers? TurboTax employs user hostile UI patterns that attempt to get consent to release filing information to Intuit and 3rd parties, switch to more expensive plans, and open new Credit Karma accounts (another Intuit owned property). I donâ€™t understand why consumers are not more frustrated.",
