      "text": "Currently, at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;spotlyt.cloud&#x2F; we are building a tool and API that enables developers build good search infrastructure for their platform be it a website, app or documentation. We are basically not focusing on owning and defining consumer experience, but focusing on the simplicity of search from development perspective just so developers can do more with less amount of code.<p>We need sort of guidance and opinion from the community and we&#x27;d love you to share ideas with us, mainly around the problems you face building or implementing search.<p>You can also recommend features too!",
