      "text": "Last year, I wrote the book Everyday Data Science. It was #1 on HN! [1]<p>This year, I&#x27;ve been working with Jim Fisher on a new kind of interactive course. It&#x27;s like a choose-your-own-adventure, except you&#x27;ll learn Thompson sampling, differential equations, and Bayesian-optimal pricing.<p>After several months, the first two chapters are ready! Every word, button, and sound has been painstakingly crafted. Try out the first chapter to see what we mean! [2]<p>The course will be $99, but it’s $29 today, as a thanks for helping us build the next 8 chapters! Let us know what you think :-)<p>- Andrew Carr [3]<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26253281\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=26253281</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tigyog.app&#x2F;d&#x2F;L:X07z8laLyz&#x2F;r&#x2F;when-life-gives-you-lemons\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tigyog.app&#x2F;d&#x2F;L:X07z8laLyz&#x2F;r&#x2F;when-life-gives-you-lemo...</a>\n[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;andrew_n_carr\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;andrew_n_carr</a>",
