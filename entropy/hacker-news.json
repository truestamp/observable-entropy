I took a &quot;Java for beginners&quot; course in university once and dropped out after 2 weeks because everybody in the course seemed to already know everything about Java and I was entirely lost.<p>I am embarrassed to admit that I don&#x27;t have the slightest idea what &quot;object oriented&quot; even means.<p>I have cracked open &quot;Clean Code&quot; recently and have made it half way through &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; a few years ago ... but can&#x27;t even find that book anymore :S<p>Are those even good suggestions for someone like me?<p>How would you suggest to somebody who already thinks they&#x27;re a good programmer to go about actually becoming a good programmer?<p>A bit about me...<p>- comfortable w&#x2F;HTML+CSS 20 years go with a SAMS 24 hour book<p>- comfortable w&#x2F;PHP 15 years ago with a PHP for Dummies book<p>- comfortable w&#x2F;Javascript 15 years ago with the web<p>- comfortable w&#x2F;Python 5 years ago through the web<p>- comfortable w&#x2F;Node 2 years ago through the web<p>Thank you so much for reading this far.
