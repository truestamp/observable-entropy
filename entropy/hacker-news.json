      "text": "Last days there are DDoS attacks against many Russian resources (news, banking, government). The interesting point is that the attacks (at least some of them, e.g. against rbc.ru) are running by live people from more than 100K communities using Tor browsers and java script code. There are also plenty of dummy curl scripts. These are essentially full-browser stack L7 DDoS attacks.<p>Typically, the attacks aren&#x27;t applicable against business resources since they require large people communities.",
