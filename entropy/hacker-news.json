      "text": "By API, I mean whatever calls that are managing your front-end data. For example, if I had many user inputs that managed closely related data, should I start from a user perspective and build out all the components with empty calls? Or should I define and build out all the calls themselves before even thinking about the components (assuming the spec isn&#x27;t super strict)? Fwiw I&#x27;m assuming a reactive, data-driven front-end. Also assuming the priority is extensibility. Does any of that makes sense lol",
