On Linux you have Proton to help with Windows games, but it cannot run natively on macOS due to macOS missing several APIs:<p>- eventfd syscall is Linux-specific, without good alternative on macOS<p>- Apple does not support Vulkan, which is needed for DXVK<p>- Apple deprecated OpenGL support, which is needed for WineD3D<p>- macOS is missing support for Python 3 OOTB<p>- etc.<p>It just looks as if they _want_ to avoid success at all costs. Is there any reason that a megacorp would make such decisions?",
