Webhooks for smart contract events, instead of having to write event parsing code in your server.<p>2. Have events formatted and sent directly to analytics services like Amplitude. Events are segmented by user wallet, so you can create retention and user funnels for your Defi application. Use this to measure analytics, optimize costs, and focus on building instead of writing boilerplate code.<p>3.
