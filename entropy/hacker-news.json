      "text": "This is Windows 10 specific. I was alarmed today when Nvidia GeForce turned off persistent screen recording (called ShadowPlay&#x2F;Instant Replay) as soon as I accessed &quot;netflix.com&quot; on Firefox 96. They claim it is to deter users from screen-recording DRM protected content.<p>Besides the privacy concerns, I&#x27;m very curious to know how GeForce Experience process does that? Does it get assistance from Windows (PlayReady etc.), or can a process just do that. I&#x27;m looking for a technical explanation. How about some process reading how many times I visit my bank website per day? Where does it end?",
