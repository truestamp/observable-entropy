      "text": "So to be blunt, is it even possible to try and raise funding for a tech product if you don&#x27;t have connections. Like, I really can already showcase some limited features and I think there&#x27;s a market for this, but the last time I really invested effort into reaching out to investors I got ignored universally. Aside from a single we looked at it, but we don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to be able to recoup so good luck email.<p>I know most of the time it&#x27;s easier to get funding if you&#x27;ve already had at least one successful exit, but then how do you get your first successful exit ?",
