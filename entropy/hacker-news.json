An example would be quietly reading books at Barnes and Noble without buying any.<p>Finding any results for such ideas has proven incredibly elusive on multiple search engines, with several dozen search variations now (including many with numerous advanced operators). Many seem to think I&#x27;m either trying to start a business for free, or trying to entertain kids indoors on a rainy day.<p>Any ideas on other such activities, or search terms that help uncover them? I&#x27;m employed at FAANG as an SWE, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m incompetent using search engines, but I&#x27;m getting nowhere with this on my own.",
