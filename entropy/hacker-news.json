      "text": "I&#x27;ve always loved using Twitter for threads and &quot;thinking out loud&quot;. But Twitter is also a slightly depressing experience — e.g. when I get likes but no replies, or when I scroll through the feed for half an hour and don&#x27;t see anything I can reply to.<p>So I built my own app with threads: [Wind of change](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;windofchange.me). I can create new threads there and slowly fill them with content, while anybody else can reply to those threads. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months already, mostly for personal notes and collecting examples and recording observations about my life. It&#x27;s been pretty great.<p>One more cool feature about WOC is that it lets me mix private and public notes in the same thread.<p>I invite you all to check it out. It&#x27;s free, has no ads, and currently built in Haskell. The source is here: &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;windorg&#x2F;app&gt;.<p>I find that it provides a lot of value for me and I don&#x27;t know any other note-taking app like that. Would love to get any feedback, too.<p>(You can also see my own boards without having to sign up, here: &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;windofchange.me&#x2F;Boards&gt;)",
