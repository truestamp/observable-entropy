      "text": "I would like to make a game with modding in mind. I thought about using Godot however after some research it seems to be very hard to add mod support in this engine. (I would gladly like to be proven wrong here)<p>I do not consider using either Unity or Unreal because I don&#x27;t want to pay for them or their royality fees.<p>Is the only option  left to use game frameworks instead of game engines? Which one do you recommend considering the fact that I want to make a commercial game which will hopefully also end up on consoles. I have experience in C, JavaScript, Java and Python also I don&#x27;t mind learning new programming languages if it&#x27;s worth it. The game I have in mind is in 2D and is similar to Stardew Valley.<p>I would like to focus primarly on the PC version. Maybe it would be best to do the game in whatever tech and pay a porting house for the console version if the game is really that successful on PC. Do you know any cons of going this way?",
