      "text": "A couple of years ago, I used a Chrome extension that allowed me to set keys to perform all sorts of actions (close tab, reload page, jump to url bar...). It was really effective because it had much more granular control over the regular keyboard shortcuts.<p>I forgot its name. I think it was a four letter, made-up word. Something like &quot;Joda&quot;. Does anyone know such an extension, or an alternative?<p>Thanks",
