I really liked it and the price was right, too, but it did not accept my international card and I won&#x27;t get my U.S. card for a while. I need a remote desktop for my work. The latency doesn&#x27;t really need to be as low as shadow.tech, I&#x27;ll use it for scientific desktop apps rather than low-latency gaming but the memory and CPU requirements are the same. I need this type of dedicated instance rather than shared VPS which does not need my performance requirements.",
