      "text": "I recently started working as a data engineer in a consulting &amp; service provider company (after working in academia for about 1 year) and have some time, a few working weeks, to refresh some DE basic knowledge and maybe learn some relevant tools. I have a background in CS did some student jobs working on dev &amp; data science tasks.<p>I started learning Apache Spark &amp; get familiar with the Databricks tools, after talking to some more experienced colleagues, and I am currently learning via the &quot;Data Engineer learning path&quot; courses at the &quot;Databricks Academy&quot;. It is a mix of lectures and smaller hands-on tasks using notebooks.  A good chunk of the 30hrs+ learning material is related to Apache Spark (12hrs+), but also some modules related to Databricks-specific tools. Some things are familiar for me due to my background (python&#x2F;scala, dataframes, queries, basic sql-like transformations, ...) while some stuff is new and&#x2F;or different.<p>I usually pick up (tech) skills by working on real projects and tasks. Therefore I do not know where to continue after finishing my courses. I&#x27;m very bad at coming up with my own project ideas, mainly because I can&#x27;t estimate the scope of the project and what I would learn from it.<p>Do you have any recommendations on what to do after finishing the course? Maybe some useful links for project ideas, ideally with usable data or  solutions to evaluate &#x2F; compare ? I stumbled upon some github repos for data (science) projects, but nothing related to Spark which I could use to strengthen my skills.",
