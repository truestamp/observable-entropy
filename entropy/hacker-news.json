      "text": "I&#x27;m currently just relying on cloud services to backup data but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s time to start using some offline solution both to avoid the risk of account lockout and to avoid having to trust third parties with sensitive data.<p>I often see comments on HN which favor self-hosting and personal data management over use of cloud services, so I&#x27;m curious what approach people here take.<p>I&#x27;ve only just started doing the research for this, but my plan so far is just to buy a couple high capacity hard disk drives which would be mirrors of each other. Occasionally I&#x27;d copy files over from my computer to one of the drives and occasionally I&#x27;d mirror the data on one drive to the other. Also wondering if I should just re-use some existing 2.5&quot; drives I have from old laptops or if it&#x27;s more prudent to purchase a new drive that might be manufactured with long-term durability &#x2F; stability in mind.",
