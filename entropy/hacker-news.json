      "text": "So for the past few months, I started building a web site that&#x27;s targeted to a niche group of people. It&#x27;s partially a social network.<p>My assumption is that it will be useful and attractive to a lot of people out there. I shared it with friends and they&#x27;ve been using it every day, so I&#x27;ve been getting good feedback.<p>I myself been using it since the very early prototypes, since it was solving a problem I had.<p>Now it&#x27;s reached a point where I think I should stop with adding more functionality, and start somehow advertising it to people that might find it interesting and join.<p>But I&#x27;m a bit stuck as to how to market this and make it known. Do you have any advice on one generally goes about making their project known to the world (not anybody, just the people that might care about it)?<p>To clarify: I don&#x27;t have any plans or even thought about monetization. I&#x27;m doing this for fun and I there are no subscriptions charged etc.<p>Thanks",
