      "text": "Anybody experience this while learning something or talking, listening, mind wanders suddenly to irrelevant things is this behavior normal to everybody basically I will not be in the present moment is this a symptom of ADHD I&#x27;m suffering a lot because of this I used to get bad reputation in the corporate companies because whenever getting the requirement I was suppose to listen properly and implement the thing as I&#x27;m a developer but I used to end up with understanding different things and this happened many times and also I&#x27;m an introvert and shy because of this trait I will not open up with my team members so that many things were unclear when they asked me &quot;Are you clear with this?&quot; out of fear I used to tell them that &quot;Yes I understood&quot; instantly and when I come back to my chair I used to assume things and implement which was leading to conflict and escalations.
