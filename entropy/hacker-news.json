      "text": "Hi HN,<p>During the pandemic, two friends and I built Grapic [1], an AR app to let us use real paper and whiteboards to brainstorm when working remote. We&#x27;re all visual thinkers and found the drawing part really lacking in tools like Miro.<p>The aim is to make it possible to screen share any real surface. We use AR and some computer vision to let you mark a rectangle on a flat surface (like a whiteboard or paper notebook), and then stream a stabilized and &quot;flattened&quot; version of that surface as video. The video can either be shared as to a webRTC room that you can access with a link or directly into a zoom meeting over Airplay [2].<p>The app is currently iOS only and we&#x27;re holding off an Android version until we know there is sufficient demand.<p>We would be super thankful for any feedback or advice!<p>Best<p>Niko<p>[1] Grapic website: [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grapic.co&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grapic.co&#x2F;)<p>[2] Note: There is unfortunately a bug in Zoom on macOS Monterey where Airplay to Mac interferes with Zooms Airplay screen sharing. Zoom is working on a fix but in the meantime there is a workaround:  [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grapic.co&#x2F;zoom-troubleshooting&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grapic.co&#x2F;zoom-troubleshooting&#x2F;)",
