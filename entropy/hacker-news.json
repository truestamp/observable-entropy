      "text": "A lot of people are interested in retro computing these days, and there is an exciting amount of innovation and possibilities.<p>My computer history is zx81, zxSpectrum, Atari ST, Atari Falcon,Sun (something), SGI Indy, and PC.<p>Whenever I fire up a Sinclair emulator, I mostly lose interest right away.\nIt is too primitive.  Getting my favorite game fired up I dont want to play it.\nThe database I wrote for it, it is kind of fun to see it running again but not really.<p>I am not able to recreate the magic that I felt back then.<p>The upgrade from the ZX Spectrum to the Atari ST was the biggest improvement \nI have ever had and probably ever will as far as computers go.<p>My second one was from probably Windows 3.11 to WindowsNT.<p>For the longest time DOS And Windows16 felt incredibly primitive compared to the ST.<p>What came before and what has come after feel more like incremental improvements.<p>Now so for me the earlier computers are not doing it.<p>I was able to get an emulator to run Atari TT, and with some fixes here and there,\nI could get it running at an acceptable resolution with more memory and speed than a real TT could ever have.<p>Finding software that was able to take advantage of the increased resolution was not easy.<p>So for me, a souped-up Atari TT running MultiTOS is a retro platform that I could use for some things as my daily computer.<p>I am hoping others can share their retro experience and maybe i will learn about a plattform I haven&#x27;t really used but that can make (some) use of modern resources.",
