      "text": "My wife recently started receiving a lot of unsolicited email from The Patriots Exchange - some Trump gun fanatic web site filled with pure fear anti-liberal drivel. The emails claim she&#x27;s a web site member and claim she&#x27;s been donating money to them. All that is false. Being Liberals ourselves, attempting to unsubscribe via phone or computer, anti-virus alerts warn to get off the page. She&#x27;s receiving several emails a day from them, and says she never actually been to the site. I tend to believe she has never visited the site - she&#x27;s more liberal than I, and I&#x27;m a Democratic Socialist, Bernie thru and thru. So, how to get rid of these scumbags?",
