      "text": "Hi HN,<p>Years ago I came across, on this site, a math book by a Russian author that&#x27;s just a carefully arranged sequence of geometry problems. Moreover, each problem is solely a picture with nary a word on the page. As I recall, the reader has to use previous results to solve subsequent problems.<p>I can no longer find it in my bookmarks and I&#x27;ve searched online in vain. I no longer remember the title or author. Would someone on this site know the book I&#x27;m thinking of?<p>Thanks\nSanjay",
