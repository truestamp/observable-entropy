      "text": "From my personal experience, Reddit.com is full of bugs. Right now, I&#x27;m trying to write a reply and copy some quote. The quote is getting copied like thrice upon doing it once. CTRL + backspace is deleting words like a thresher gone haywire. Every now and then, my karma count fluctuates. Sometimes it&#x27;s even 0.<p>I really didn&#x27;t want to write this here and defame a site but I am really bound. People from Reddit Inc., if you&#x27;re seeing this, please do something about it. Really it&#x27;s taking me a lot of time trying to write a reply. I&#x27;m not saying this happens all the time when I open reddit but that&#x27;s the point, I don&#x27;t know when it&#x27;ll go haywire. It needs fixing.",
