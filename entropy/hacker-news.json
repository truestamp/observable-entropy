Just as when patients who receive treatments from doctors do not go to the same doctor if there is an emergency a special emergency unit is created to handle these.<p>3. Whenever the teams are global then oncall shifts would be split according to working hour timeszones.<p>4. Whenever we get pages we demand time allocation to fix the root cause no matter how much time it takes and we are going to have a product freeze until the pronblem is fixed.<p>5. We are not going to incorporate in any oncall shift which have less than 8 people in the shift such that we would have space in between shifts.",
