I get a fair amount of interest from startups by posting here in the monthly &quot;Who wants to be hired?&quot; thread, but a month is a long time to wait when a job has become intolerable.<p>Any tips for beating ATS resume filters?<p>I skip and leave blank any section in a job application form that asks for information that&#x27;s included in my resume like &quot;work experience&quot;. Does skipping these invoke the ire of the ATS?<p>I also skip any demographic&#x2F;disability&#x2F;veteran status questions or choose &quot;decline to answer&quot;. I assume there are serious legal strictures against taking those into consideration when evaluating a candidate.<p>How important is a cover letter? Is a two or three-sentence cover letter sufficient? necessary?<p>General online job hunting tips?",

Even once all that is setup, the retrieval process is nothing like &quot;wget magnet:&#x2F;&#x2F;...&quot;.<p>To be clear, projects like aria2 (C++) and webtorrent (nodejs) do exist, but try to use them for anything production-ish grade or in an automated fashion and you&#x27;ll find out they are slow to start the downloads and overall unreliable and flaky.<p>A true &quot;wget&quot; -style system for seeding and downloading from a private torrent swarm would be amazing for many use cases.  I&#x27;m envisioning something like a program that monitors a folder and any file that ends up in the folder gets auto-seeded to a set of private clients.<p>What do you think?",
