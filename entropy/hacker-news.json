I suppose you could bulk migrate everyone using this approach and then require everyone to reset their password?<p>How do people migrate their user data off of AWS Cognito?<p>Full disclosure, I work for a Cognito competitor (link in my profile) and the doc I&#x27;m working on will be published on their site.",
