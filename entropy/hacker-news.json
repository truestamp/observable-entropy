(CI&#x2F;CD will only execute once)<p>This way I don&#x27;t have to worry about replicating each application data from one data center to another and worry about where data is being written and so on.<p>I want to ask HN, are there best practices or documentation on how to do this kind of architecture that you can point me at?<p>Or is there a better way to work on this solution?",
