      "text": "I keep seeing references from official sources about inflation being at 8.5% YoY. Yet every person I speak to tells me a similar story that their typical grocery run went from $100 to $200 (or more)<p>Why are we struggling to just say inflation is 100%? I can&#x27;t find a single item that I normally buy that isn&#x27;t double the price it was last year.<p>Also the official numbers don&#x27;t really mean anything for the general population. I would say that most people have a couple items in their life that they normally HAVE to buy that have quadrupled in price - whatever that may be - seems to have an effect of making them lose an additional $5,000 to $10,000 per year. Not sure how the gas prices are going to affect this.<p>Why are the officials refusing to just say it? We can&#x27;t fix things if we hide under &quot;good looking&quot; numbers.<p>At first I thought it was me buying Tillamook cheese (for example) until I bought the store brand last week and realized it was the same damn price.<p>My only guess is the government switched pricing things at Safeway to pricing expired cheese and eggs at Dollar General or something.",
