We think the best version of the future is one where humans partner with AI to take their own capabilities far beyond what&#x27;s possible in a mutually exclusive world.<p>GoCharlie.ai is our first attempt at this, and focuses on creating optimized for engagement social media marketing content.<p>People are using it for SEO work, D2C Product Marketing Campaigns, and getting rid of writers block when starting from an image.<p>We&#x27;re different from Jasper and Copy.ai as we are starting with going across media modalities from the start, and we develop our own AI models.<p>Let us know what you think!",

      "text": "It&#x27;s been one frustrating week! Got banned after being hacked on facebook. I have a page with over 20k followers on our IG account and close to 20k likes on our FB page and all IG accounts linked to my personal account have been disabled. Not only that, I was banned from advertising and the hackers used $4000-$5000 ish in ads that was funneled out of the PayPal account connected to it. I want to dispute it with PayPal and the bank but have no one of seeing what was exactly &quot;advertised&quot; with the spending costs because I cannot log in. Ridiculous. We&#x27;ve spent well over 6-figures in advertising over the last decade or so and the business pages being disabled cripples our online presence (not to mention, losing photos and connections from my own personal account I&#x27;ve been using since 2006-2007).  This is also a family business that is our livelihood.<p>If you know anyone from Meta&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Instagram that can have some empathy and a heart to help (or if you know someone you can forward this to), please reach out to me at roger@petzonesd.com.\nI feel everyone&#x27;s suffering and frustration here. Account got disabled for going against community standards by the hackers and not a single thing can be done as &quot;their decision is final and cannot be reversed.&quot;",
