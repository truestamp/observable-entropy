      "text": "I listed one of my car for sale on craigslist and had someone contact me outside my city. The conversation started off very natural with the &quot;buyer&quot; asking very relevant used car questions. Then he said he is out of town and is willing to send me a deposit to hold the car. He said: &quot;Before I send you a deposit, please send me a selfie of you, with your drivers license with a piece of paper with todays date July 5 2022. also include a copy of the vehicle registration &amp; insurance.&quot;<p>I got caught off-guard as I sold my last car also to someone remotely sight unseen. So I sent him what he asked. The next morning I woke up and had a sudden realization that I probably got scammed. I went back to the email and realized the phone number and personal email he provided were both fake. He used a generic common Chinese name of &quot;Charles Lau&quot;.<p>I googled selfie ID and it looks like a lot of crypto site (including Coinbase) is using selfie + id + hand written text for biometric verification. Some banks since covid also implemented selfie ID verification.<p>I filed a local police report and contacted my driver licensing and insurance, which they said theres not much they can do.<p>My question to HN is what are some of the risks to me as this scammer now has my Selfie + ID + vehicle registration + address. Knowing that crypto sites uses this for verification, can the scammer create a bunch of crypto exchange accounts under my name and start laundering dirty crypto money? or take out a crypto&#x2F;regular loan under my name? What can I do to protect my self going forward?",
