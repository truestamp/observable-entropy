      "text": "The greatest scam every continues at 3.5 years and counting.<p>Twitter verified accounts still being hacked to promote giveaways<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;KrungsriSimple&#x2F;with_replies<p>tons of doge stolen<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blockchair.com&#x2F;dogecoin&#x2F;address&#x2F;DMEhXC7bchfZGJn7JkuyCngkBoUsFSHZs4<p>Even people with close to zero engineering and coding experience have proposed solutions that would fix this problem if only twitter would implement them.<p>No shortage of victims no matter how many times the scam resurfaces, which is a testament to the popularity of btc and elon musk and the ineffectiveness of efforts to warn people. Binance and coinbase have combined  100 million of accounts. I have yet to a scam as lucrative as this one...not just profitability but impunity.<p>Even cartel&#x2F;drug gangs and dealers  and the mafia would be envious of these kind of risk-free profits (no DEA, no FBI, no dealing with rival gangs, etc). Same for ransonware, in which there is too much risk relative to reward.<p>If the scammer asks someone to send between $200-$200k+ of doge&#x2F;btc, etc, in the promise of 2x more, some will send the max amount or close to it , which is like a single major ransomware payout but without all the risk and huge footprint that comes from spreading ransomware. The fat right side of the victim-distribution tail is in large  why this scam earns so well.<p>My estimates give a total of $40 million stolen with twitter and $40 million with youtube since 2018 years with the bulk 90% of the profits in 2020-2021. The higher bitcoin goes, the more $ they make. It&#x27;s hard to say which is better, Twitter vs. YouTube. Twitter I think is more lucrative only because of elon musk. 50 million followers + traffic from retweets means applying the Drake Equation to it guarantees a lot of $ and victims.  IF not elon musk, then obv. youtube would be better",
