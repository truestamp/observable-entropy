I see figures like 200k-300k in the Bay Area, and maybe similar for remote positions.<p>I&#x27;m getting FOMO as a young engineer in deep learning&#x2F;computer vision at a small European company. My plan was to stay at my interesting job with average pay until I stop growing, then hopefully jump to a company that pays better when I feel like it. But what if the market shifts and salaries go down?<p>Is there any indication of what the job market will become for tech employees in the next few years?",

Those old terminals? Like the current &quot;raspi-config&quot; we have.<p>Obviously it is pretty hard to navigate with a keyboard on mobile, but &quot;mobile first&quot; does dictate a design that is very narrow and would fit a keyboard navigation.\nIt is funny to see how all cloud providers has a Cloud Shell.<p>Have we decided that navigating with mouse is the best interface?",
