      "text": "I want to open-source a mechanical invention of great importance to humanity - for 2 reasons:<p>1. Once the information is in the public domain, nobody can claim a patent anymore (and thus not block the wide&#x2F;fast spread of the invention). Note: A Chinese judge may for example not strike down a patent if the invention was published in an obscure paper journal that only exists offline and in the US; the chosen medium must ideally have a certain visibility to ensure this &quot;prior art&quot; status and there must be a credible&#x2F;verifiable date of publication.<p>2. Everybody should be able to use and build the invention (and ideally contribute to its wide&#x2F;fast spread and improvement&#x2F;optimization)<p>Open-sourcing maximizes the collective benefit for humanity - that is my goal.<p>What are the best platforms&#x2F;tools&#x2F;approaches you know of that allow this? (There is the _proprietary_ &quot;Defensive Publishing&#x2F;Prior Art Database&quot; by IP.com, but it&#x27;s hugely expensive to upload a bit of text and a few images, which turns me definitely off. Ideally somebody would build a blockchain-based service for this.)",
