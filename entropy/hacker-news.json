      "text": "I stream most of my music, but I&#x27;ve got a collection of MP3s that I keep around and still listen to sometimes. So far I&#x27;ve been using TuneBox, an iOS app that hooks into your Dropbox and provides a media player interface over it. This is a great premise, and it mostly gets the job done, but it hasn&#x27;t been updated in several years and has some minor bugs&#x2F;annoyances.<p>Surely there&#x27;s still a decent, maintained iOS app for playing local music files? I&#x27;m willing to pay, and I&#x27;d even be fine without Dropbox integration; my collection doesn&#x27;t change very often. I&#x27;m just having trouble even finding an app that matches the original iPod app that used to exist on iPhones.<p>Any recommendations?",
