      "text": "I recently had to discuss covid-19 and vaccination with a few people that could be loosely defined as &quot;no vax&quot;, or against vaccination.<p>Despite my best effort, I found it very hard to provide reliable, clear data points and&#x2F;or research to use in the discussion.<p>For example, impact of vaccination by age group, in terms of reduction in hospitalization&#x2F;death, compared to non-vaccinated people.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of data sources out there; it would be helpful if you could share your best ones.
