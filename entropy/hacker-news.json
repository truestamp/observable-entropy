      "text": "I recently quit my job as a backend software engineer because I was not enjoying the work. My career so far has basically ~4 years of backend work at a couple of companies - so c#&#x2F;Python&#x2F;PHP, database stuff, etc. I&#x27;ve always liked systems programming, so I&#x27;m taking something of a sabbatical to just work on projects that will hopefully land me a job in that domain.<p>Right now I&#x27;m relearning c, and then I guess (?) I&#x27;ll relearn c++ too since there don&#x27;t seem to be many rust jobs yet. I&#x27;m doing &quot;Linux from Scratch&quot; and building my own shell right now. After those are complete I plan on building my own version of Docker, and then maybe moving on to some kind of virtualization project (or maybe creating my own file system, just whatever seems fun).<p>So, using my home-built version of docker as an example, would it be better for my resume to spend a ton of time building out my own software (open sourcing it of course) or should I spend that time contributing to an existing open source project? I worry that if I choose to contribute to open source it&#x27;ll take up half of my time just getting familiar with the existing codebase, and I wouldn&#x27;t actually have that much to show for it. I would also be a lot more locked in to that specific project, and would have less time to explore different options (maybe I find out halfway through that I prefer driver development to containerization - I can move more nimbly when working on my own stuff).<p>I really need to make sure I&#x27;m optimizing this time off, so any guidance is welcome. I can take as long of a sabbatical as needed, but I&#x27;d like to keep it as short as possible so I can get back to saving for retirement :)",
