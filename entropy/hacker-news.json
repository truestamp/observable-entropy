      "text": "I’m 26 and have been using Facebook since middle school. At a certain point, the only thing I used it for was Facebook Events, because all of my friends were already on the platform. But also, it’s just a super easy way to view event details and track attendance.<p>I noticed that my sister, who is 19 and never had Facebook, is in a separate WhatsApp group for each event that is created with friends. I think that’s a little crazy and inefficient. It’s so wild to me that people her age probably don’t even know that something like Facebook events exists!<p>Besides for people like her, there are plenty around my age that are beginning to leave Facebook. So I figured, why shouldn’t we have something similar that isn’t tied to Facebook?<p>I hacked together https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inviteable.app. I don’t really know if there’s a market for it. I’m curious what others think.",
