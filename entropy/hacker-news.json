      "text": "Im looking to create a react based dashboard&#x2F;portal for a B2B SaaS business.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a vendor to supply a full starter project based on React, SQL, TypeScript, Lambda functions etc.  This could be in the form of a code generator or a pre-built portal that allows new pages to be added.<p>We expect to code up all our business specific pages, but don&#x27;t want to start from zero.<p>It should \n- Generate or provide a basic  backend dashboard \n- Allow you to add pages using the command-line.  Hopefully you could specific a page type.  \n- Integrated with high-end grid, tree and other UI-components\n- Use Auto0, Cognito, etc for user&#x2F;group management. \n- Source code available for a price<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few similar ideas in the past, but they all have too many limitations.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aspnetzero.com&#x2F;\nThis is basically what we want but its written in aspnet and is not designed to be modified.  and has horrible support<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;retool.com&#x2F;\nAnother great tool but its built to replace backend tools. Its too lo-code.  We want a source code generator<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scaffoldhub.io&#x2F;\nThis is currently the front runner, but it looks like a lot would need to be added.<p>Thanks<p>Mitch",
