      "text": "Hello,<p>I have a new software product. I am about to onboard the first customer. We have not spoken about price.<p>The customer is large. Market cap ~ $12bn, publicly traded.<p>The problem I am solving is big. Over the past year we have documented at least $15m in direct cost prevention, with about an $8m increase in associated revenue.<p>The solution also prevents substantial liability. $100m+ at a minimum, sometimes more. This might occur once or twice a year – or more.<p>They have been trying to solve this problem in-house with no success for several years, at a direct cost of over $2m a year, plus a few (8ish) salaries.<p>My solution is simple, but it works. And they are asking about it with increased interest. We are nearing the first real demonstration – one that incorporates their own data. I expect to be asked about pricing.<p>Q: How do I sell a solution that has such a high value when I was able to build it almost entirely by myself in a few months?<p>…after years of industry learning, research, and experience, but still – it is a fairly simple solution.<p>I am concerned that I am not the best person to make this deal. I have never done anything like this before.<p>A price-deal based on a % of saved cost doesn’t really work for this service, and I need revenue to continue to grow the company and improve the software, so that option is pretty much out as far as I can tell.<p>Even with the past 18 months of specific examples, and over 10 years of their data to back up even more examples, I am still up against the fact that they know me and my team. They know we are small, and I feel like I will lose the deal if I ask for $45,000 per month. I feel like I will get the deal if I ask for ~$12,000 per month.<p>We have a technical roadmap with increased value add offerings but so much value to the customer is available in the current product.<p>What should I do? How do I go about handling this? Has anyone experienced a similar situation?<p>Thank you, \nAn0n",
