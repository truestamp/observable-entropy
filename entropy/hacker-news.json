      "text": "https:&#x2F;&#x2F;6b.eleuther.ai&#x2F;<p>William de Cantilupe was killed by multiple stab wounds in Scotton, Lincolnshire, in March 1375. The de Cantilupes were a wealthy English family and had a history of service to the crown. They were major landholders in the Midlands, with estates in Greasley, Ilkeston, and Withcall. William de Cantilupe&#x27;s ancestors included royal councillors and, distantly, Saint Thomas de Cantilupe. Among the suspects in the murder were his wife Maud and the sheriff Thomas Kydale. Maud may have had an affair with Kydale during her husband&#x27;s frequent absences on service during the war in France. Fifteen members of the household were also accused. De Cantilupe&#x27;s murder was the first to come within the purview of the Treason Act 1351, a statute which declared the murder of a man by his wife or servants to be petty treason. Maud was tried and acquitted. She then married Kydale. Two members of the household staff were convicted and executed. Others who were indicted did not appear for trial and were outlawed. One of the outlaws, de Cantilupe&#x27;s steward, John Tailour of Barneby, was pardoned by Richard II.<p>Q:  Why does the last name of this murderer and his victims sound like a type of candy?<p>A: The de Cantilupe family name is the same as the candy maker. John Hargrave, whose family founded a candy company, died in 1688.<p>Q: Why was there no mention of William de Cantilupe in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales?&quot;<p>A: Chaucer was born in the 1300s. The Chaucer Society has never found Chaucer&#x27;s original manuscripts.<p>Q: How was William de Cantilupe killed?<p>A: According to the Chronicle of Battle Abbey",
