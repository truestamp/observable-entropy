      "text": "As an organization grows, new stakeholders tack on additional processes to account for secondary concerns. When it comes to cross-team decision making, the decision maker is no longer anyone in the group but instead an executive with little context. As a result, I see &quot;committees&quot; being formed where the executive delegates the responsibility to a group of subject matter experts, who can advise and green light projects. This has been a huge bureaucratic bottleneck at the company, and reduces the accountability individuals have to make sure things get done or implemented.<p>What are some solutions you&#x27;ve seen implemented (at companies that have &gt;250 engineers) to minimize the amount of &quot;death by committee&quot; decision-making an organization does?",
