We are looking forward to your feedback!",

Businesses seem to respect both enough to pay large amounts of money for the work, and people out side of the tech space don&#x27;t seem to care either way. I have alternated between the two fields for ~10 years and have ran into UX and Devs who phone it in, and who act like professionals, but the professional craft seems more common in development.",
