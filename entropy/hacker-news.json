      "text": "I find React hooks complex and hard to gasp. They feel too smart and over-engineered. When I write JavaScript I tend to think of simple functions with normal programming constructs. I&#x27;d rather use basic variables (on instances, localStorage, URL, etc..) rather than a weird beast like `useState(0)`. What is going on here? Am I stupid or something?",

We played 5 on 5 to 7 all 1 pointers. What I liked though was it wasn’t you’re on till you lose, but winner stays for first game then just each new team gets to play 2 games.<p>Then when it got to over 16 players in the gym we switched to half court 4on4 with 1s and 2s. Same only two consecutive game rule.",
