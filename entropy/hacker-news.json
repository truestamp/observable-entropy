      "text": "Given the reversal of Roe V Wade, we&#x27;ve seen a great deal of doctor-ordered drugs refused to be vended by pharmacists due to &quot;religious reasons&quot;. A variety of these drugs treat symptoms like lupus, Crohn&#x27;s, and others. They do share a side-effect, in that they can cause a spontaneous abortion.<p>Combined with that, are places like CVS that put out an order to all pharmacists to withhold these drugs. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newrepublic.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;167087&#x2F;roe-cvs-methotrexate-abortion-pills<p>So I&#x27;m asking this: what is the feasibility of automating a pharmacy, to make faster, cheaper, and less biased service for what your doctor orders? Have any YC companies approached this?<p>(Please note: this is a feasibility of automating pharmacies. I do not wish this to be yet another tired pro&#x2F;anti abortion thread. We have enough of those online. And those never provide answers - only more angry people.)",

I was looking for libraries or frameworks that would help me build these things, but I&#x27;m not going to go through the entire learning path of Vue and React, so I remembered working with jQuery and Bootstrap 7-8 years ago maybe and I&#x27;m considering using these.<p>Do you have any recent experiences with this stack? I see both of them have recent releases and they seem actively maintained. jQuery UI also has a ton of useful plugins. Should I start with this stack? Would you recommend something else?",
