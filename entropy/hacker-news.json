      "text": "Long time looker, first time Show-er here!<p>I built the initial BrainTool to scratch a personal itch - to unify my bookmarks and online resources with text-based notes. I&#x27;ve spent the last several months iterating on it with feedback from early adopters and UX volunteers. It&#x27;s finally at the point where I feel confident enough to seek this communities feedback.<p>BrainTool is a browser extension that makes it easy to save pages of interest into a personal &#x27;topic&#x27; hierarchy, along with associated notes. Your topics are shown in an editable side panel which can also control the browser - opening and closing tabs, tab groups and windows by topic. There&#x27;s a 90 sec intro video here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7zvyvATpoVM<p>The above by itself makes BrainTool one of the handiest bookmarks&#x2F;tabs&#x2F;browser managers around, but the kicker is that all your data is stored in a separately editable org-mode[1] format plaintext file. Off-browser I edit my braintool file in emacs but I&#x27;ve also played around syncing with LogSeq, Orgzly and other org-based tools. If you&#x27;re an emacs user it could give you a shallow on-ramp into the world of org-mode, if you&#x27;re an aspiring PKMer it&#x27;s an easy way to slurp in all of your online resources, if you just want to get out of tab hell and up your browser game - dive right in!<p>Its serverless so your data never leaves your personal environment. Chromium-based browsers only for now (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc. not FF).<p>Landing page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;braintool.org<p>Some articles on use: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;braintool.org&#x2F;posts.html<p>Github repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tconfrey&#x2F;BrainTool<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orgmode.org&#x2F;",
