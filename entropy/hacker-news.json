      "text": "I recently put an end to a drawn-out and stressful chapter of my life. It lasted many years and I&#x27;d like to get a sense of closure. Yet I can&#x27;t seem to fully rekindle the same energy of my younger self. I&#x27;ve bought a couple of books to celebrate, but I haven&#x27;t opened them yet because I don&#x27;t want to <i>taint</i> them with past memories, if it makes sense.<p>How did you close the previous chapters of your life? It may sound strange but I almost feel I have to <i>ask for permission</i> to move on. Like it&#x27;s not real unless I share it with someone else.",
