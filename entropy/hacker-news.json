      "text": "I love low level kernel&#x2F;OS stuff but loathe the operating systems we have today. Windows, Linux, and BSD&#x27;s designed are heavily rooted in principles we designed 30+ years ago. These weren&#x27;t designed with the requirements we have today - like configuration management for servers, live security upgrades, mitigating CPU flaws.<p>I want to see something radically different. Whether it&#x27;s for desktops or microcontrollers I don&#x27;t mind.<p>I&#x27;m aware of a few hobby projects such as SerenityOS which are cool but still very &#x27;inside the box&#x27; in terms of design and don&#x27;t really have any backing.",
