      "text": "I spent my first 4 years in the industry doing freelance and word-of-mouth contractual work. The following decade has been all corporate, salary positions. This has all been remote&#x2F;WFH.<p>I&#x27;m interested in consulting. I want to make sure I understand what separates a consultant from a salary employee, freelancer, or even just an entrepreneur. I am also curious how one successfully enters the consulting world.<p>My goals are to have more control over my schedule, avoid another decade of job hopping, and enter the next stage of my professional development. I have no interest in corporate politics nor do I care to watch Slack or have my butt in a seat during certain hours just in case someone needs me. I&#x27;m hoping that I understand what it means to be a consultant and whether its a good fit for me.<p>Can anyone shed some light on what life is like as a consultant along with tips or anecdotes about getting started?",
