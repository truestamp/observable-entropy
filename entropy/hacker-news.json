I think most of us agree that Rust does many things right in this regard.<p>Still, a holistic view needs to take other aspects into account. One is the long term reliability of the ecosystem regarding language changes but most importantly regarding the required third party libraries.<p>Do you have concerns, experiences, opinions about this? Did you chose another language because some of your required third party dependencies are still on version 0.x or depend on a single person or don&#x27;t seem to get updated frequently?",
