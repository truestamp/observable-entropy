I was curious - how do the veterans, and new(er) users of HackerNews monitor their accounts for comments as there are no &quot;notification&quot; channels?<p>What I generally do is - keep account-&gt;comments tab open and periodically refresh. I&#x27;d imagine there are more efficient ways about this though.",
