      "text": "A few days ago we got an email from HN user thehodge\n(<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=thehodge\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=thehodge</a>), aka Dom Hodgson,\ntelling us that HN&#x27;s SSL cert was about to expire—as indeed it was.\nAll the renewal notices had been going to Scott&#x27;s old YC email, which\nno longer works.<p>Dom runs <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlewarden.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlewarden.com&#x2F;</a>, which monitors sites for upcoming\nissues and lets you know when you&#x27;re about to publicly embarrass\nyourself. In a twist on eat-your-own-dog-food (eat someone else&#x27;s dog\nfood as a community service?), he had set up alerts for HN in their\nsystem. Lo and behold, it delivered the goods, and that is why you&#x27;re\nreading HN as usual today, instead of certificate expiration\nscoldings, and therefore also why my ass is intact.<p>I figure the least we can do is proclaim our thanks, so all hail Dom\nand Little Warden! Yes, I know most of you can do this in 3 lines of\nPython and a cron job, and yes yes, there are other alert services - but\nonly one has personally helped you waste time unimpeded on the\ninternet. That is all.",
