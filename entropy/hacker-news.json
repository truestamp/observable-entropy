      "text": "I&#x27;ve been a backend software engineer my entire career. Given the companies I used to work for, I never had the time to fully embrace my interest&#x2F;passion for embedded devices. I&#x27;ve played around with various discovery boards, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>I finally feel like I have the time to deep dive. I have a couple of ideas of what I&#x27;d like to do, but not many thoughts on how to get started.<p>Can someone experienced in designing embedded devices give some guidance&#x2F;advice? Are there books&#x2F;online courses you&#x27;d recommend? Is it even feasible for a hobbyist like me to design and create something from scratch? I&#x27;d really love to carry this thing from beginning to end (designing schematics, PCBs, etc etc), without using discovery boards. Any help is much appreciated!",

      "text": "I have 7-8 years of experience as a software dev. Currently I am pondering if I should take the step to become a freelancer at some point in the near future. I was self-employed before but that were special conditions. (I am located in Germany if that matters.)<p>My main questions are: how do you realize this change? Do you try to find contracts before leaving your day job? Where&#x2F;How do you find work?<p>I know the most common platforms but are there some rules you should follow on there?<p>Do I have to suck it up and offer my service for &quot;cheap&quot; in the beginning? Or should I only take jobs for my self-defined minimum even if it&#x27;s my first?<p>What else should I consider?",
