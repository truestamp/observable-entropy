      "text": "The recent Ask HN side project thread is a reminder for me to learn new skills for 2022 that would give the capabilities to develop side projects that can be potentially monetized.<p>In terms of tech skills, I am currently learning R for basic inferential statistics for grad school. Otherwise, I have no other relevant programming knowledge--and I am not sure how one would monetize R &quot;side projects&quot;.<p>For those with experience building side projects, what technical skills should I learn in 2022 that would enable me to create side projects? I think an initial step in learning Python would be useful. In setting these goals, I have to be aware that I&#x27;m still in grad school, and do not have all the time in the world, of course.<p>&quot;Skills&quot; is a broad word and can encompass many different things. Maybe technical skills related to medical side projects would be more relevant to me, but I&#x27;m also interested in other areas of tech.",
