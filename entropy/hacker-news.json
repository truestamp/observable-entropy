      "text": "I currently work at a crypto startup (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dydx.exchange&#x2F;) and we&#x27;re having issues finding engineers to interview with us, specifically backend &#x2F; smart contract engineers. From my perspective, I&#x27;m not sure why we can&#x27;t find engineers; dYdX is one of the top decentralized exchanges in crypto and is doing ~$4B in trading volume per day with a current annualized revenue of ~$800M per year (profit margin of 75%). Offers are competitive with FAANG and we are remote friendly.<p>Given the above, I&#x27;m worried that we can&#x27;t find engineers because they don&#x27;t want to work for a crypto startup. From your perspective, would you work at a crypto startup? If no, then what would it take to change your mind?",
