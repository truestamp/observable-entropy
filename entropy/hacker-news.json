      "text": "I often observe misunderstandings in communication and I think it really hampers mutual understanding, trust, connection but also efficiency (in a work context).<p>I am wondering, what are examples of environments where there is very little misunderstanding? What are patterns that might enable that? What can we learn for human interaction?<p>One example: I heard that the military sometimes has the requirement that a given command shall be repeated verbatim by the person who received the command in order to make sure that it was understood correctly.<p>Another example might be the HTTP protocol which ACK(nowledges) requests. The protocol is interesting because it aims to achieve robust, mutual understanding in a high-failure environment because messages can easily get lost.",
