To do so, I&#x27;ve decided to buy a bunch of textbooks in those fields as well as foundational textbooks (mostly math books).<p>The problem I&#x27;m having is I am having trouble connecting some of the content in the book with a tangible end result. For example, I have difficulty staying focused learning about certain theorems in a linear algebra textbook when I can&#x27;t see myself ever using the theorems in real life.<p>Do you guys have any advice on how to stay motivated? Or perhaps how to learn these subject areas avoiding these &quot;time pitfalls&quot; (are they even pitfalls)?<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
