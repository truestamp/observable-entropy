      "text": "I&#x27;ve always worked at growth stage startups since transitioning to tech about 10 years ago. I started as an IC and built the technical foundations and when a team was needed, I declined the offer to manage. Well, eventually they didn&#x27;t succeed at hiring a manager and designated me. I grew to own a large team of teams and function. I decided I was right the first time and really dislike most aspects of being a manager, and I left that company&#x2F;role with the goal to become an IC again. When I was hired at latest company, I was extremely clear that I was not interested in anything on the management track and was hired as a senior IC. A few months ago, the functional lead ( my manager) was fired and I was forced to take over despite my being abundantly clear I did not want to and it would make me unhappy. It was promised to be interim until they could hire. After 2 months, there isn&#x27;t even an open rec.<p>This has happened more than once now. I&#x27;ve been very clear about the type of growth I want, and don&#x27;t want to manage peoples work and growth and be the shit umbrella of organizational politics. It drains me, I like solving technical problems and systems. I enjoy that and I&#x27;m good at it. Just because I&#x27;m a decent manager too doesn&#x27;t mean I want to do it.<p>Do I just threaten to quit if I&#x27;m continued to be forced to manage a team instead of the IC role I was hired for? How can I avoid being put in this situation again? I made it very clear I was not interested and wasn&#x27;t really given any choice not to.",
