      "text": "Cost Of Living Adustment (COLA): increasing pay to match inflation to result in a net zero change in purchasing power. theoretically separate from performance review&#x2F;salary raise.<p>Why aren&#x27;t companies doing this? I&#x27;ve only seen one company since leaving the military that does performance review+COLA to change pay. Myself and many friends got a ~3% pay &quot;raise&quot; last year when mostly everyone agrees inflation was ~6%! This is a pay cut. (the one company i personally know that does cola+performance, the CEO is prior military).<p>isnt this obviously bad? you guarantee employee turnover to keep ratcheting payscale (which the US is seeing on historic scale) and disgruntle the remaining workforce. does everyone really think theyre saving on payroll short- and long- term by not doing COLA?<p>what am i missing?",
