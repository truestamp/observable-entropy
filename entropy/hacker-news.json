      "text": "As of this posting, we are one cent under the record average high for gas prices, with higher prices projected to come. I would qualify this as a economic danger to our economy given it&#x27;s state.<p>What can we do? The North Dakota shale oil industry was basically killed by Saudi overproduction&#x2F;dumping a few years ago.<p>Lean on OPEC to increase production? Biden and MBS do not get along. They will likely reap profits.<p>Rollout BEV cars and trucks: not enough supply and not enough recharging.<p>I believe there is a short-term EV strategy though: the electric bike. With spring&#x2F;summer coming, I believe the US should institute a 500$ - 1000$ purchase rebate on any electric bike. This is a means of maximizing available battery supply for the best result of transportation. It is the maximum number of EVs for the minimum impact on our grid. e-bikes can assume huge amounts of local trips, and with burlys&#x2F;trailers, substantial amounts of errands for basic goods.<p>And it would be a way to directly support the Ukraine, by dropping the price of oil that Putin will use to fund it.",
