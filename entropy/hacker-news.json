These 2 frameworks not only provide a good developer experience, but they also allow you to create fast ecommerce storefronts. This provides users with a good experience when using an online store.<p>In addition, as Medusa is a headless commerce platform, developers can create a custom storefront with any frontend framework of their choice. They just need to interact with the REST APIs.<p>If you were to create an ecommerce storefront and had full freedom to choose which frontend framework to use for the storefront, which would you pick and why?",
