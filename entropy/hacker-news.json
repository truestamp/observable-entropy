Whenever we (client) officially share info on our project, I will forward the same to my colleagues in my consultant company (in Slack channel). It is a great project and I am very excited to share that. But no one in my consultant company usually responds (appreciate&#x2F;suggest) to my message. It is an active channel and I see reactions to other messages.<p>It could be something or nothing, but I am interested in what makes people behave like that.<p>Please share if you have any theory or research to this or similar situations.",
