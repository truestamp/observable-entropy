      "text": "Non-technical user here: I recently graduated from optometry school and would like to make a website with a few useful tools for calculating some numbers that are important in optometry. I&#x27;ve always wanted to learn how to program and I think this might be a good introduction to it. I&#x27;d like to make a simple website that takes mathematical inputs and gives outputs. I would also like it to be mobile-friendly.<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for a newbie to the tech-space or am I in way over my head? I&#x27;m asking on HN becuase there seem to be a dizzying number of ways to create a website with little experience, but it seems like everyone is just selling a product, which can be a little off-putting. I&#x27;d like to be a little more self-sufficient and learn how to do things along the way.",
