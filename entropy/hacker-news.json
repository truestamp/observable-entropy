      "text": "Hi guys!<p>Bubble.io is an amazing service. You can build literally any kind of apps with it. I hope the no-code will help you as it helps me.<p>My short story:\nA year ago I started to think about solutions for online creators to be able to acquire followers in some cheaper and easier way.<p>So, I started to search for developers to bring my ideas to life.<p>After 6 months (end of Spring 2021), a lot of talks, and 1 YC interview, I&#x27;ve realized what with the current team we&#x27;ll launch the product at least in December 2021. So it meant 6 months and at least $5,000 per month on frontend and backend developers. Toooooo long time and too expensive.<p>And then I found Bubble.io.<p>Today my startup &quot;Surfaces&quot; has more than 120 users. I&#x27;ve built it in 2 months with Bubble and spent $29&#x2F;month for its subscriptions. Dreams come true with no-code!<p>I&#x27;ve collected a few tips and resources on how to start with Bubble:<p>How to start with Bubble (5 tips)\nList of bootcamps (3)\nList of Youtube channels (4)\nList of communities (3)\nList of useful plugins: for analytics, writing, email, and payments (11)\nList of newsletters about No-code and Bubble.io (4)<p>Here&#x27;s the link to get the pack: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;surfaces.one&#x2F;minilanding&#x2F;pack-of-the-tips-you-need-to-quick-start-with-bubbleio",
