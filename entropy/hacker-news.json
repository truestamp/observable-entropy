      "text": "My hypothesis is that people who, on the spectrum of extrovert to introvert, are more towards introversion are the ones leading or driving the efforts to build metaverses and similar people who are drawn to such environments. This theory holds good with my circle of friends. The ones who are not socially outgoing are the only ones who are even following updates related to this. I would also like to understand if there are certain domains of the metaverse that people who consider themselves extroverts are more drawn to.<p>Fitness &amp; Gaming seem likely to appeal to everyone.<p>But what about Work, Socialising, Shopping, just Exploring?",
