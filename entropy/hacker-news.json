      "text": "So I&#x27;m a senior engineer and I&#x27;m a little over a month into a new job and my gut constantly tells me this is not the right fit. Everything from the social aspect to how the team is arranged to the work that I&#x27;m doing.<p>It is a new team in the company where everyone has been recently hired so it was difficult to get a feel for things when everyone&#x27;s response was &quot;I&#x27;ve only been here for a few months&quot;<p>I have a standing job offer at another company from when I interviewed there earlier this year so I could reach out and take that one which since I have friends who work there I know it&#x27;s a pretty good place.<p>Here&#x27;s the rub though. I&#x27;m making a ridiculous amount of money at this job. Like retire in a few years money, and leaving to take the standing job offer would be cutting total comp by a substantial (+100k) amount.<p>What are your thoughts?",
