      "text": "I noticed that the Software Updates page has changed recently (probably within the last week or so).<p>Previously, it would say iOS 14.8.1 is the latest and there are no updates available, with a banner near the bottom to upgrade to iOS 15.<p>As of now, all that is gone. It has been replaced with a page to update to iOS 15.1 as if it was a regular update.<p>So my question is, is Apple planning to remove the option to stay on iOS 14 or are they simply trying to drive up the adoption rate of iOS 15?",
