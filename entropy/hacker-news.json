      "text": "I nearly fell victim to a very sophisticated phishing attempt while traveling in Montreal. While trying to order from an Indian restaurant named India Rosa, I found a website with a very slick online ordering form. After entering my dinner choices, credit card info, phone number, and email, I was shown a dialog that indicated the last step I would need to follow for my order to go through would be to enter an SMS verification code. The code arrived with a ding on my phone, but when I went to enter it I noticed that it was actually a Bank of America 2 factor authentication code. If I had entered it I’m almost certain my banking credentials would have been compromised. And to top it off, I bet that I’d still need to order dinner.",
