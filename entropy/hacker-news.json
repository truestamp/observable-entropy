The repository includes &#x27;doc&#x2F;pmu.md&#x27; with a copy of Intel&#x27;s software reference manuals (PDF) so, all in one place, you can understand and develop PMU profiling for your Intel micro architecture.<p>Example included. Source code is 451 LOC with comments.<p>Features:<p>* Minimum, complete<p>* Does not require yum install msr-tools<p>* Header only: include and you&#x27;re done<p>* Works in user-space and&#x2F;or kernel code<p>* Very low latency because PMU is<p>* Programmable event types. Includes support for fixed counters<p>* Well documented<p>* Handles thread pinning if requested<p>* Simpler than PAPI, Nanobench, and PCM by one or two orders of 10.",
