      "text": "I&#x27;m cofounder of 3, we recently exited our startup at $50m valuation. The three of us have become very wealthy, and we were asked to move to a new state by the acquiring company.<p>With that, we&#x27;ve each indulged ourselves a little in terms of the apartments we rented&#x2F;bought in the new state. We&#x27;ve also socialized a lot more with each other after the acquisition. Over the past 3 weeks we&#x27;ve partied hard 3 or 4 times. It seems like we&#x27;re all a lot more relaxed, and overall less stressed. It feels really positive, and good.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed in myself going from 60 hour weeks, to 40 probably.<p>I still definitely feel a drive, there&#x27;s a lot of potential upside being so close to the founders of the company that acquired us, but I must say it&#x27;s not the same drive I used to experience.<p>It&#x27;s like a weight is off my shoulders and the feeling of needing to succeed is a lot more dull... but it&#x27;s definitely still there.<p>I&#x27;m curious if this is a normal experience after an acquisition? A mentor of mine mentioned that in his experience founders take it easier 2 years after an acquisition as a sort of recharge period.. The thought of that makes me uncomfortable for some reason...",
