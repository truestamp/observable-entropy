      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;d like to hear your opinions on career development. I don&#x27;t want to limit this conversation to sofware engineering&#x2F;IT in general, so feel free to comment no matter your field.<p>To start, I&#x27;ve summed up some of my research. Some things are more clear cut, others heavily opinionated:<p>- Learn as much as you can, try to have fun working and in your free time (do have free time, at least x% of your waking day) and don&#x27;t burn out.\n- Just get more experience\n- Do side project work\n- Contribute to popular open-source code\n- Work at a big, well known company<p>Looking forward to your input!",
