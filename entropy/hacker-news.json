      "text": "Hi everyone, Anuj here, Dataherald CEO.<p>There are a bunch of EXTERNAL data sources in the world that people use a lot -- think census data, Bureau of Labor Statistics (unemployment, inflation), but even proprietary data sources. I was tired of getting these into useable data pipelines every time I need need to use them.<p>Dataherald simply creates data pipelines to hundreds of data sources and then lets you create auto-updating data viz -- all in under 60 seconds. The goal is to enable non-tech users to more easily use data, which has been a huge problem for me throughout my career.<p>We initially launched with local newsrooms because there was a huge technical barrier for local reporters to use data to educate and inform communities; we&#x27;ve started to solve that.<p>*We&#x27;ve overhauled the search feature of the product and looking to share with the HN community.*<p>Pls take it for a spin<p>-Anuj",
