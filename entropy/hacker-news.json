      "text": "For some reason, I can work all day from my Lenovo Ideapad 310 laptop, but, as soon as I moved my desktop and ASUS monitors into the room, I&#x27;ve been unable to work for more than an hour before eye strain kicks in.<p>I&#x27;ve been left with a choice: neck&#x2F;back strain from the laptop or premature aging&#x2F;eye strain&#x2F;lack of sleep from the desktop. I&#x27;ve chosen the neck&#x2F;back strain. I would like to be able to use the desktop because it&#x27;s far faster, has far more RAM, etc.<p>One of the desktop monitors is ASUS PB258Q. I can&#x27;t ID the other one, but it&#x27;s also ASUS. I wake up tired after using the desktop monitors, but it also coincides with my antihistamine intake due to spring&#x2F;summer season. I seem to be developing dark brown &quot;age spots&quot; after I wake up if I use the desktop monitors for a prolonged length of time (more than two hours), and I think it&#x27;s the combination of the monitors making me tired + the antihistamines making me more tired. I can&#x27;t tell if the dark brown spots will go away or if they&#x27;re permanent. They seem to be developing under the eyes and on my nose. They&#x27;re not baggy eyes; they&#x27;re smaller dark brown spots around the same region.<p>I&#x27;ve read that monitors can reflect the sunlight&#x27;s UV rays that causes skin damage. (The window is behind me.) I&#x27;ve just moved the desktop monitors out. I&#x27;ve tried every setting on the ASUS monitors: blue light filter (on every level), adjust brightness, adjust contrast, and so on.<p>Would love to be able to work from my desktop. Anyone else dealt with similar issues that can offer advice? Thank you!",
