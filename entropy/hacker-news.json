Clean the dead skin flakes: First you should let your fingers soak in warm water (you can place a few fresh lemon slices in the water to soak out the dirt from the nail crevices to soften the nail skin). Dry your hands and then use the stick to gently push the soft skin, then use dead skin scissors or a dead skin fork to remove the excess soft skin flakes around the nail, and finally use a nail brush to clean around the nail. Then dip your fingers into a basin of water and rinse them off as you brush.<p>3. Apply emollient cream: After drying your hands, apply emollient cream and massage it repeatedly with your fingers for 2 minutes until it is absorbed. Last but not least, wipe the nail surface and nail crevices with cotton dipped in alcohol.<p>To view more different designs for Simicure, please visit: www.Simicure.com",
