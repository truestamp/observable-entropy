      "text": "Hi everyone! I&#x27;m Alan, creator of Recase, a zero-setup cache to help you avoid making redundant API calls.<p>If you&#x27;re like me, you try your best to avoid paying for API calls. While solutions like Redis and Memcached exist, Recase keeps you from having to rewrite this code every time you have a new project that needs it. Recase is pretty simple at the moment, but in the future I&#x27;m planning on adding more specific cache configuration and tools.<p>Sign-up is optional and I&#x27;ve created some documentation on how to get started. I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback along with other problems you deal with when working with APIs!<p>Thank you!",

I mostly need OTA updates and the ability to update the core OS (rasobiaN). I also took a look at ubuntu core, easy to install and I guess I could build a service page myself that logs in, deploys a docker and so on ... are there any similiar services out there I missed (saw google, ms, dell, ibm, particle, fracctal ...)?",
