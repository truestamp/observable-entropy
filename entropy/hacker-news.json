      "text": "Hello,<p>i am a foreigner Bachelor Student (Business Informatics) in Germany (came a half year ago). I had experience with HTML and CSS. One and half year ago, I decided to learn JavaScript also. I completed FreeCodeCamp course and The Odin Project. My Portfolio was enough to get my first working student job as a web developer on December 2022.<p>I then started with Tasks like removing the BootstrapVue UI Library and replace with regular Bootstrap in small projects. That took like 60h, because I had to learn vue first. My colleagues said but nothing negative about my work.<p>Yesterday was for me like disaster. I worked until 22 o&#x27;clock, (I had to stop at 17 o&#x27;clock) to find out that I&#x27;m running a microservice in a Docker Container and the changes I made on a mail template had no effect, when I send them, since I was working on local files. I feel myself an idiot and can&#x27;t tell anyone.<p>Am I doing the right job? I can surely say, that I love frontend development and also backend with java and Python. But loving a theme is enough to do it as a job?",
