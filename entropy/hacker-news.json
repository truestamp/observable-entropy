      "text": "Hey hey,<p>My girlfriend is an environmental scientist but is currently learning to code. She&#x27;s done a bootcamp (Scrimba, JavaScript), and now is working on a side project of mine&#x2F;ours (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript)[0]. I think it&#x27;s a great way for her to learn, since it&#x27;s a real project with real users and I can give her feedback in PR reviews, like it&#x27;s done in the real world.<p>Eventually, she wants to get a proper job as a junior dev, to get the experience of work in a bigger team and not just with me, and to see how she likes this profession.<p>Do you have any tips on how to find a junior dev role without a traditional computer science background? Most job listings I see are for more experienced devs...<p>Thanks!<p>0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;shafy&#x2F;fugu",
