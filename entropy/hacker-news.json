      "text": "Application context:\nCurrently a fairly basic .NET application that has been dead in the water for a bit due to the original author leaving the company. A few tables, a few pages, fairly simple AWS API calls. From what I can tell, not a compute intensive application.<p>Company context:\nSmall, been frozen for some time due to the developer not working on the code at all, hard to hire for the codebase without spending a lot of money that they don&#x27;t have. Ideally having me come in, within 4-6 months having a slightly improved version of the application up and running, but on a more common stack. I would be in charge of hiring new developers to work with me on the project right away.<p>My background:\nBeen working in Python for about 5 years, the past 2 years have been very intense on Python. The past year I have been working in Go as well. We have moved some of our API&#x27;s to Go due to the speed gains from the migration. I would say I am significantly more comfortable with Python, but I know the performance I can get from Go is very nice.<p>The ask:\nWhich language do I migrate the backend API&#x27;s to? I have been torn between the two languages. Python would be the fastest off the ground for me, since that is what I am more comfortable with, but Go might be more &quot;future-proof&quot;? What if we implement some more compute heavy features that may benefit from the speedup of Go? I believe the timeline is doable for both languages, with Python getting finished sooner I am sure. Is it worth taking the risk of maybe running up on the deadline with Go?<p>Any suggestions on frontend are also welcome, currently just going with React due to my own past experience.",
