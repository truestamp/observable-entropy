And I don’t even want to mention the crap cake  that is KaiOS...<p>HMD Global... .. ... Where can I start.. what is it? Where did it come from? Who the hell do they think they are? They are not “global” at all!\nThey wish!\nIt is a joke and a pathetic excuse of a company... and an insult to every person who owned a classic Nokia..\nBut seriously what is their endgame?\nPissing people off? Because thats the only thing I can see..\nThey don’t care one bit about anything they make, you can observe that very clearly..",
