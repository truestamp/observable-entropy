      "text": "After participating in a few past discussions in HN, I have noticed many comments whose main argument is developed upon one or several of the following misconceptions. Disclaimer: I am an EU citizen.<p>Misconception: &quot;The browser decides to send cookies.&quot; Wrong: A browser, or user-agent in general, will never invent a cookie out of thin air, and therefore it never sends a cookie unless it has been set by the webserver beforehand (either with an HTTP header &#x27;Cookie&#x27; or with JavaScript code). [1]<p>Misconception: &quot;Consent forms are mandatory for all cookies.&quot; Wrong: Cookies that are essential for the proper functioning of the website (e.g. supporting a login session) do not need any consent form, and can be set silently. [2]<p>Misconception: &quot;Consent forms are mandatory _just_ for cookies.&quot; Wrong: User consent must be obtained for any kind of processing of the user&#x27;s personal information (where no other lawful basis exists for the processing), no matter what technical solution achieves that processing. Example: A tracking pixel needs the same consent form as a tracking cookie. [3]<p>Misconception: &quot;By browsing this site, you implicitly accept tracking cookies.&quot; Wrong: Consent must be opt-in, informed, freely given. If it&#x27;s not freely given, it is not consent. Also, the user must be able to revoke consent just as easily as consent was given. [3]<p>Misconception: &quot;If a user doesn&#x27;t like cookies, they can just disable them in their browser.&quot; Wrong: Some cookies may be essential for proper functioning of websites. Browsers cannot technically propose any means to disable only non-essential cookies, that&#x27;s outright impossible. The only entity capable of deciding if a cookie is essential or not is the website that sets the cookie. [2]<p>Misconception: &quot;Marketing or tracking cookies can be disabled: just disallow third-party cookies.&quot; Wrong: marketing or tracking cookies can also be set by the first-party, ie. the website being visited. Example: Google Analytics. [4]<p>Misconception: &quot;Cookies are morally justified because the webmaster has to cover the cost of running the website.&quot; I disagree: that reasoning is only valid for not-for-profit websites. If the webmaster struggles to cover the cost of running the website and cannot find a legitimate source of income, they are welcome to shut it down. No website is entitled to make money off of non-consenting visitors. &quot;Staying afloat&quot; is not a right of the webmaster, it is a privilege.<p>Cheers!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;HTTP&#x2F;Cookies<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cookieyes.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cookie-consent-exemption-for-strictly-necessary-cookies&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.chino.io&#x2F;gdpr-compliant-consent-tracking&#x2F;<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.optimizesmart.com&#x2F;google-analytics-cookies-ultimate-guide&#x2F;",
