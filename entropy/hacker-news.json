      "text": "I want to start a teaching business. I&#x27;m struggling to find good open-source software on which I can start building my platform. The state-of-the-art seems to be Moodle or Canvas which are designed for universities - they use archaic UI and features.<p>Is there something where I can host an online course, also have live classes and perhaps add on features like a community for students, assignments, etc? The only options I am seeing are things like Kajabi and Teachable which are very restrictive in their feature set, and not customizable.<p>Anyone running an edtech company here? What do you use? Or do you build everything custom?",
