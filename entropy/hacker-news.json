      "text": "I understand all the criticisms of Cardano, but I don&#x27;t understand what people are actually looking forward to. I don&#x27;t understand what the line in the sand of failure would look like to those people. Where can I be indoctrinated?<p>Maybe there is something interesting happening. For most Cardano sycophants, I can tell it is not an objective comparison of the technology they aim to build versus what has been built on other distributed ledgers, but for some of those people they are people that have demonstrated competency in other technical areas, or at least understand how a crowd thinks, which is beneficial. And I don&#x27;t understand what they think in regards to Cardano.<p>I like to understand all sides.<p>What is even remotely convincing about that project, the eUXTO model, and where can I get excited about it?",
