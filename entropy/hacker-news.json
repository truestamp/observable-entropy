The Ukrainians fight their battles not only at the frontline but on the media landscape as well.<p>Certain Russian websites fuel the flames of war and channel the hatred towards Ukraine; encouraging acts of terrorism and genocide in Ukraine. Disconnecting Russian websites will help bring the Russian propaganda machine to a stop.<p>As the main companies providing SSL certificates, we hope you choose to contribute to our cause by revoking SSL certificates issued for Russian propaganda websites, as well as stopping issuing new certificates for these companies.<p>I also ask the CEO of Cloudflare, Inc., Matthew Prince to ban Russia from the Cloudflare services. Disconnecting Russian websites will help shut down the propagandist disinformation flood Russia is feeding to the world. You can help stop the war.<p>Stand with Ukraine!",
