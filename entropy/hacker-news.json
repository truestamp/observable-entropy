There are probably 10,000s of photos from about a 20 year time span.<p>I would like to digitize. The local places I&#x27;ve contacted that provide this service are either too expensive or not a place I could trust. So I think I am going to DIY.<p>Hoping someone can give tips on hardware or software that could make this easier. Large flatbed scanner + the right software that can parse, separate, store multiple images at once? Has anyone done a large undertaking like that that can provide some guidance?",
