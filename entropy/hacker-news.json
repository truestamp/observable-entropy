      "text": "Hello HN,<p>I am in a bit of dilemma. I started a enterprise software startup with a bunch of friends in college, we got a bit of funding and I dropped out. We did couple hundred k in revenue and raised a bit more but eventually we couldn&#x27;t make it work. For past 2 years feels like I have been in a zombie startup and want to move on.<p>For people who have been in the same boat, what did you end up doing? As for getting ready to be in the job market again, what kind of positions did you end up applying for?<p>I am thinking either:<p>1) Join a seed&#x2F;series a startup as a developer and grow with them. Pros of this are this is what I know how to do best and love working in small teams<p>2) Join a more established bigger co. Pros are a more stable position but not sure it will be an environment i will be able to do well in",
