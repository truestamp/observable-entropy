      "text": "Am I the only one who is bothered by loud music playing in restaurants (and bars)?<p>In the past couple of months, I noticed that nearly every restaurant I go to plays music in the background. Oftentimes so loud that it hinders conversations. The latter is the reason why I am going to a restaurant in the first place. Even worse, it seems like one can not even sit outside and enjoy the sun anymore without the venue blasting music on the patio.<p>I am considering creating a crowdsourced website that lists whether or not a restaurant&#x2F;bar plays music (maybe even generally the loudness level). Is there interest in contributing to such a site from the HN community?",
