It also has server-rendered social card images, and once a post is published, you can see basic stats about how it&#x27;s doing.<p>You can try it out for free, and then once you&#x27;re ready to make your site public, it&#x27;s just a $20 one-time payment to keep the lights on.<p>Let me know what you think :)",
