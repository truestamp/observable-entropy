      "text": "In our website we clearly state that we are in beta testing phase and that we&#x27;re looking for beta testers.<p>I was convinced that being clear on this was good. But three times already other people have told me to, at the very least, hide it a bit as it will scare away potential users.<p>So, I&#x27;m confused. Should I just stick to a &quot;try it for free&quot; msg (as in fact, as of today, you cannot yet buy the product) instead of saying we&#x27;re beta testing?",
