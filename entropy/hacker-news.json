      "text": "Built this simple community search tool that basically allows people to search through thousands of past Reddit threads and tens of thousands of recommendations using tags. It mostly covers a few bigger subreddits like r&#x2F;BIFL, r&#x2F;MFA, r&#x2F;AskMen, r&#x2F;SkincareAddiction but along the way, I expanded it to include other smaller subreddits too. In addition to filtering by category, power users can also search by<p>-Body Fit (big thigh, long torso)\n-Occupation (work in retail, teacher, doctor)\n-Age (18-24, 25-35), Size (height, weight)\n-Brand comparison (similar to: X)\n-Use (suitable for wedding, everyday wear)\n-Location (available in UK, use in Northeast US)\n-Mood&#x2F;Style (minimalist, vintage, retro)<p>Check it out at redreccs.com<p>Buy fewer, buy better.
