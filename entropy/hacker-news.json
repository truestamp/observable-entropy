Then went on to find other live map services and liveuamap.com also seems to be down.\nI&#x27;m wondering, could these be related to what&#x27;s going on in Ukraine? Have you encountered other outages that could be connected? These are not the official government sites that were reported to be attacked some hours ago, but live information sites with probably valuable information for civilians. Liveradar24 is not a military intelligence site, but some MIL transponder codes were tracked on there, as well.
