I&#x27;m guessing it may be because I created the account from a Linux system.  I added a phone number and it informed me that my account had been disabled and that I could not appeal this.<p>I have logged into the account 0 times and just want to create a business profile so I can connect with my users and potentially advertise in the future.  Does anyone here know whom I might contact?  There is no way I can find to talk with a human.  There is a phone number that is entirely automated; I left a message and received no response.<p>Thank you.",
