      "text": "I just started a job at my school as a researcher in a neuro lab. I was under the impression that I would be building an open source PET image processing software for rat studies, but it turns out I&#x27;m just doing data analysis with Python and using old, abandoned software to analyze the images. It&#x27;s only been a few days and I&#x27;m feeling really down about the whole thing. I&#x27;ve had okay luck applying elsewhere and I am considering just quitting and getting back to the personal project&#x2F;leetcode&#x2F;application grind. I am already graduated though, which makes me a bit nervous.",
