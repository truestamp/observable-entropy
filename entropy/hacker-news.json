      "text": "I made a functioning prototype of a Raspberry Pi project that I think has applications in a retail environment. I intend to demo this project for local stores in the coming weeks. As I do, I want to start thinking about the design of the product, the layout of its wiring, the construction of the housing, which consists of metal, glass, and plastic elements. I also want to start thinking about how to manufacture a completed design. What steps does one take, who does you hire, what resources do you take advantage of, in the process of turning a prototype into a product? Right now, the people involved are myself, with a smattering of knowledge on the hardware and software sides, and a software engineer, who has little knowledge of the hardware side. Who do you hire to consider the design challenges, and where do you find them?",

      "text": "Companies such as AllRecipes, BigOven and Yummly have millions of combined recipes saved within their systems. BigOven, for example, has a clipper tool (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigoven.com&#x2F;clipper) that allows users to copy recipes from other sites and save them in BigOven. Based on Copyright Law, lists of ingredients are not copyrightable, but creative works (ie. ingredients + instructions + images) are. Under this understanding, recipes that are copied beyond the ingredient list into BigOven (or other recipe database) would be breaking copyright law.<p>Are there reputable sources (attorneys) in Copyright law that I can contact - if it&#x27;s within legal means, I desire to compile a list of recipes (name of food &amp; list of ingredients only) and sell this collection to users who are interested.",
