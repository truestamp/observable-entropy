      "text": "Learning about languages like Smalltalk and Erlang, made me think about software that is modified during runtime. I&#x27;ve seen the Erlang video as a small demo of what&#x27;s possible.<p>Still, I wonder how modifying a software system which runs works in practice. Therefore I&#x27;m wondering if HN has practical examples of systems that ran for a long time and we&#x27;re modified during runtime. I&#x27;m curious how this works in OO languages (like Smalltalk), in functional languages and in logical languages such as prolog.<p>Does anyone have experience with this?",
