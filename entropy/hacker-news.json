Analyze the insights\n2. Approve&#x2F;Reject influencer\n3. Get contact info and then negotiate the details off the platform.<p>Additionally, we would add the campaign performance &amp; reporting in the near future.<p>Let me know if you know any e-commerce owners who would love to give our product a test and provide a feedback:)",
