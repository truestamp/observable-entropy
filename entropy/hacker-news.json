However,  I got a reply from person B (not a group chat).  B was asking me why I was calling him, but i sent a screen shot of my chat proving that I had sent nothing.  B then sends me a screen shot showing my message!!!!<p>1) this was not a group chat\n2) I did not delete the message\n3) the message recieved by both A and B has the same time stamp (therefore proving that they were not sent sequentially)<p>regards\nrtnrscal",
