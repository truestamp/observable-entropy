      "text": "Hi All,<p>I have recently wrote an inquiry about Canadian Tech jobs (&quot;Who Is Hiring In Canada&quot;), and got mixed responses.<p>I am a 31 (almost 32) years old European, EU citizen (Hungary) wanting to relocate to Canada (Toronto&#x2F;Vancouver). I have checked out the options, so far I have seen two ways of managing the move:<p>- going there as a Skilled worker and also as a Maverick: I have to show 14k CAD on my account for the entry and try to find a job once there<p>- going there with a Valid Job Offer from any &quot;Canadian&quot; company (must be established, and registered there), no budget check, just need to cover the first few months<p>I am actively applying on LinkedIn&#x2F;Glass-door, whatever jobsite I find. I&#x27;m a full-stack engineer with IT BSc having 8 years of commercial experience (startups, fortune 500s), so &quot;skill-wise&quot; I should be qualified for many jobs, even if I have to accept sacrifices like the role&#x2F;tech&#x2F;salary, whatever it takes to get started.<p>I have lived in three countries in Europe already, it is simply &quot;boring&quot;, and the war in Ukraine puts my foreseeable career&#x2F;life at risk. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not a refugee, but wish to live on a much greener pasture.<p>If you have any tip, insight, or a name of a Company worth to checkout, please don&#x27;t hesitate to comment! Any help is much Appreciated!<p>THANKS!\nArpad",
