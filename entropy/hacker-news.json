      "text": "As we have a newsletter for weekly top 10 investments, I&#x27;ve been researching to see what industries raise the most money from investors.<p>Obviously, If you have a great product, you&#x27;ll be able to raise enough money to scale your business, but it really seems like a few industries can attract more attention and eventually more money.<p>1. Financial technology<p>We don&#x27;t need a new PayPal or Coinbase but we actually need platforms to make the ability to work with money more effective, that&#x27;s why we see big new money platforms every now and then.<p>Acrons is a great example here, Acorns is a finance company that allows individuals to round up purchases and automatically invest the change.<p>Acrons recently raised $300M from a series F making their total of funding over $507M.<p>2. Communication<p>Building a new Facebook is not reasonable, but creating a platform to connect two special groups of people can be good enough to give you millions of dollars.<p>MessageBird is a cloud communications platform that connects enterprises to their global customers.<p>They have raised over $1.1 Billion, only $1 Billion of that comes from their series C.<p>3. Artificial Intelligence (AI)<p>Based on statistics, The AI market is expected to reach $190 billion by 2025, So you can imagine its high growth potential.<p>We&#x27;re seeing many new AI startups, They try to automate everything with AI, and every successful AI startup is a step toward a better future.<p>Building an AI startup with a useful innovation can almost guarantee that you&#x27;ll be able to raise enough money to scale your business.<p>Databricks is a data and AI company that interacts with corporate information stored in the public cloud.\nThey&#x27;ve raised $3.5 Billion already in 9 founding rounds.<p>That&#x27;s it.
