I don&#x27;t think I ever get legit emails that have the word &quot;email list&quot; in them, but I&#x27;m not sure! I&#x27;m also not sure how to best use gmail&#x27;s logic to make a filter that applies to email with (1 or 2 or 3) and (4 or 5 or 6).<p>Any suggestions for how to do this? I wish the gmail filter got smarter and realized that I always junk emails that have certain types of content, and which are not from my previous recipients.",
