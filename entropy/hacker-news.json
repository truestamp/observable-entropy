I guess that there could be some flexibility from that genetic inheritance.<p>[note 2]\nI don&#x27;t use a &#x27;left handed&#x27; mouse (it&#x27;s a vanilla symmetric thing, and cheap!), and I don&#x27;t swap the buttons (so, all I need to do at the library&#x2F;kiosk is pull the cable to the other side).
