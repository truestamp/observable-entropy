      "text": "I am currently the solo developer for a small team where I run the technology side of the company.<p>I work directly under the CEO who has zero technical background. He is constantly pinging me for status updates, setting my priorities for me, and overall tends to micromanage. He strongly prefers an in-office presence so that he can ping me with questions and requests throughout the day. When I worked from home, he would ping me for updates throughout the day, sometimes even scheduling a second end-of-day standup. Now he expects me to work in-office because it&#x27;s &quot;better for rapid communication&quot;, which really just means he can micromanage more easily.<p>This morning I accepted a great offer for a remote position at a more established tech company.<p>My current predicament is that my boss will likely be completely screwed when I leave. To make matters worse, our account manager put in her notice yesterday, so he&#x27;s already scrambling to find a replacement for her.<p>I am curious how to go about this transition without burning a bridge and screwing over my current team. One month isn&#x27;t nearly enough to transition somebody into my role.<p>Has anybody experienced leaving a solo role without screwing over their company?",
