      "text": "I “nearly”invented an entirely new class of software, but went out of business before getting there.<p>Many years ago I came up with a concept that dominates the world of software today, and I did it before anyone else. My idea lacked only one critical feature.<p>My idea was so very close to being an idea that within a few years others would complete, leading to untold riches.<p>And for me nothing but failure.<p>Every day I think about how very very close I was to gigantic success.<p>How do I deal with this constant looking back?<p>Surely others feel the same way, nearly being highly successful, nearly finding the winning formula, being only an inch away from winning.<p>How do people handle this? How do you handle being inches from immense success, and instead being loser?",
