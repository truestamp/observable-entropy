I&#x27;ve looked for this but so far not found much beyond [0] -- although the motivations for this are also touched upon by [1].<p>Scraping is an arms race, of course. A simple but often successful way to fight scraping is, for instance, changing the names of classes routinely. This affects scrapers more than users, because a user doesn&#x27;t see those class names, while a scraper relies on them.<p>Is anyone scraping using only (or mostly) computer vision on the rendered browser screen, and simulating mouse clicks and key presses?<p>It seems like anti-scraping measures to defeat an CV-based approach would be more intrusive to the user and thus they would be used less often.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimbobewenhall&#x2F;OpenCV-website-scraper\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;incolumitas.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;05&#x2F;20&#x2F;avoid-puppeteer-and-playwright-for-scraping&#x2F;",
