      "text": "Seems like more and more, progress in software translates to concentration of power and wealth. At best it allows corporations to replace humans with machines, or it makes their systems larger and more homogenous and less nuanced to the realities of individual lives. At worst, it directly enables oppression from authoritarian entities.<p>I often find myself wondering, how can I help tip the scales back the other way a little bit?<p>Some would probably chime in with &quot;free software&quot; initiatives like GPL, distributed protocols, and the like. Those sound nice on paper, but with a few exceptions I haven&#x27;t seen much evidence that they actually translate to a real liberating effect. This is partly (not completely) due to the fact that you usually have to be technically savvy to even take advantage of them.<p>What are some technology projects that would put some agency back in the hands of normal people?",
