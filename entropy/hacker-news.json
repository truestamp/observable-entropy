This is weird, because FB employs ~60K people, including lots of engineers (and probably good ones, according to the company&#x27;s average salary), so there&#x27;s definitely a lot of FB people <i>reading</i> HN.<p>I wonder if, because Facebook regularly gets very bad press here (stories about Facebook are overwhelmingly negative, and so are comments), FB people don&#x27;t feel confident to speak.
