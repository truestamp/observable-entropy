However, I found some ShowHNs had both, for example https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30517299. How was it achieved?<p>I have 2 speculations, not sure if one is correct: 1. The author submitted a link, then made a regular comment, and a mod decided to move that comment into the body. 2. The author filled both the url and the text fields when submitting the post, in which case the text would be hidden by default, and a mod decided to reveal it.",
