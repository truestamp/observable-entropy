      "text": "I always find myself forgetting necessary variables when programming. For example, when I am summing the numbers between 1 and 5, I might remember to start the for loop<p>for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {<p>}<p>but then I&#x27;ll realize I forgot to initialize a counter, so I&#x27;ll go back up and add int counter = 0 at the top.<p>To combat this issue, I&#x27;ve been visualizing code in the future while writing the current code. This has been making my brain sharper and improving my programming. However, no one talks about it. Thoughts?",
