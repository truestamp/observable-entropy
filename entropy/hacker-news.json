      "text": " There was an article posted to HN within the last 12 months or so I&#x27;m trying to remember. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t bookmark it so lost it.\nThe title or at least the article content was about the &quot;broken window&quot; theory applied to code. The website has a white background, with a red line at the top. The links at the top are also in red. Overall an aesthetic site.<p>I believe the articles author is Dutch with a name that starts with a Y.<p>Can&#x27;t remember many other details. Hoping someone knows the one I mean.",
