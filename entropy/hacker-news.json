One hack was allowing a web2 company to pay twitter followers with crypto from a dashboard, another was offering immediate washout on marketplaces.<p>To show other founders what we&#x27;re up to with it, we&#x27;ve loaded up a couple hundred bucks on it, and you can withdraw just by entering your email or text at this link <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.blocksend.co&#x2F;hngiveaway\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.blocksend.co&#x2F;hngiveaway</a>.<p>And if you want any help integrating or getting a key, let us know!",
