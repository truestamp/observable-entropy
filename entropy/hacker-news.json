      "text": "Even though Wave was killed more than 10 years ago, I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate its value until recently, when I had to spend a fair amount of time in some group email threads discussing complex subjects.<p>Would using chat instead solve the problem? Not really. In my opinion, chats are great for exchanging quick single-line replies. But to have a real discussion and arrive at a meaningful conclusion, we actually need more structure, not less structure. Which made me realize I wanted a product that worked exactly like Wave, but without some of its annoying features.<p>In my opinion, the real-time typing feature was one of the main things that killed Wave. It&#x27;s a very helpful feature for document editing, but maybe not so desirable when exchanging regular messages. Taking this feature out of the equation, it amazes me that no one (that I&#x27;m aware of) has built a product with basic Wave features to support intuitive threaded discussions with granular access control that can be used in both social and workplace settings.<p>Reading some of the threads here on HN with people saying they wouldn&#x27;t mind giving this idea a second chance if some product implemented it properly (with clean user-friendly design etc.), made me realize I might not be alone in this thinking. So after building and using it myself for taking notes and communicating with a couple of friends, I&#x27;m now ready to start sharing it with the rest of the world hoping to get some feedback on whether this implementation can be of any interest for others.<p>Thank you for reading this long introduction! Please let me know what you think of this idea.<p>My goal with this project is to small steps, iterate, and based on any feedback I can get, hopefully, eventually produce something that can provide a non-zero value :)",
