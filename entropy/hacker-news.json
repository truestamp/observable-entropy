      "text": "I&#x27;ve been thinking lately about Twitter&#x27;s monetization model; the way they closed their API and undermined the work of so many developers years ago. And now that Elon will purportedly purchase it, there&#x27;s been a few people discussing different ways to change it.<p>One interesting suggestion was by Stephen Wolfram, where he tweeted about a Twitter &quot;App Store&quot; where you could install third-party feeds. And it got me thinking, what else would this App Store have?<p>I&#x27;m a staunch believer in bottom-up processes cultivating innovation. Some of the best games, discoveries, and inventions were a mixture of trial and error and thorough observation because some random person was tinkering here and there.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s more to innovation than just accidents, but an open place where people can play and experiment and install new &quot;apps&quot; or &quot;plug-in&#x27;s&quot; sounds immensely interesting.<p>Off the top of my head, it would be amazing if one could install a LaTex module, so people who wanted to express complex mathematical expressions could do so.<p>Or have a custom feed with a slider bar so you can adjust just how much negative and positive sentiment you want to see, where -1 is 4Chan levels of cynicism and 1 is Sesame Street; the point being users can choose just how much vitriol they want to expose themselves to.<p>Or having the ability to request money to have an question answered with a bounty.<p>Example:<p>Tweet: &quot;I recommend everybody take long walks. Great for your health!&quot;<p>Reply: &quot;Do you have any book suggestions?&quot; attached with a $1.99 bounty for answering.<p>These are just suggestions. I&#x27;m not necessarily looking for whether or not an App Store is a good or bad idea, but as a hypothetical, if it existed, what would it look like in practice.",
