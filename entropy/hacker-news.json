What is the scaling story like? What about the costs and maintenance involved?<p>I&#x27;ve got experience with Go and Java, but I&#x27;ve only ever used Node for scripts and super simple internal APIs. I don&#x27;t have experience with Ruby&#x2F;Rails nor Django, and used Elixir many years ago and enjoyed it but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to invest my time on it.<p>Interested to hear your thoughts. My biggest pros for Java&#x2F;Go is that it is tried and tested. I&#x27;ve heard many people use Rails and that it is super fast to build stuff with it. The cons is that it is hard to find people who can use Java&#x2F;Go well enough, and I&#x27;ve worked on too many projects with spaghetti code and horribly designed architecture. A dynamic language seems easier to refactor or just re-write, compared to these.",
