      "text": "Hi everyone!<p>Some friends and I were unhappy with how much work it was to use C++ from other languages. We were working in the optimizations industry and often had to prototype with python. Eventually, we created a tool to make it easier for C++ to talk to python (by generating pybind11). Later, javascript via WebAssembly was added as well. It&#x27;s now at a point where it&#x27;s very easy to just create a C++ library and use it from any of those languages without change. We&#x27;re planning on slowly adding more languages as needed&#x2F;requested. The next on the list are Swift and Kotlin.<p>It does not require any change to your existing public interface, but simply reads it and creates the bindings off of that. It should also work on Linux (Debian), MacOS, and Windows (Visual Studio). Here&#x27;s a small demo if you&#x27;d like to test:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tolc-Software&#x2F;tolc-demo<p>And here are the repositories with the source code:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tolc-Software&#x2F;tolc - The executable<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tolc-Software&#x2F;frontend.py - The python bindings generator<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tolc-Software&#x2F;frontend.wasm - The WebAssembly bindings generator<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Tolc-Software&#x2F;Parser - The C++ parser<p>It is dual licensed with AGPL and, if someone wants, a commercial license as well.<p>Would be cool if someone finds it useful!",
