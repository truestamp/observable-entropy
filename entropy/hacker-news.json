      "text": "Hello.<p>We are a team of mobile game developers and our app Pico Cats https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.pico.cats.online.puzzle.picocats got suspended today on Google Play due to &quot;Impersonation policy&quot; - the reasoning provided is that our application icon and application name is similar to someone else. But Google never mentioned who they are referring to.<p>We have literally checked all available application names and there is literally noone that uses such application name and our app icon is hand drawn by 2D Artist.<p>We have filed an appeal on Google Play, but based on comments I have found on the Internet, Google reviewers do not even read your appeal, if its suspended it means its suspended. We are so tired of this. How can we fight it? File a lawsuit? Get help from a lawyer? Is there some other legal body where we can appeal and get our application reinstated?<p>Would appreciate your tips!",
