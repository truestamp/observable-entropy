I logged in to another google account that didn&#x27;t have an adsense account and suddenly I got an email that my adsense account was flagged as a duplicate and I was banned. I tried their &quot;appeal&quot; but of course some robot made a decision to keep the ban. Looking for some help -- any help at all, to try and get my adsense account back. My email address is in my profile. I&#x27;m hoping some benevolent googler can help out.",
