      "text": "My company is evaluating migrating from QuickBooks to a better financial ERP system. While the search is still underway, one thing is now clear: no matter what system we&#x27;ll end up picking, the data conversion will not carry over the attachments stored with the transactions. And that&#x27;s bad.<p>So all along we have been using QuickBooks also as a repository of invoices, purchase orders etc and now once we upgrade we have a dilemma:<p>* lose them all<p>* continue to maintain and upgrade the QB license to maintain our digital database.<p>There must be a better solution, or a market opportunity for a hacker in this forum.<p>What do innovative companies use as a repository of digital documents?  Mind you that while it&#x27;s 2021 often we get PDF that are not searchable&#x2F;indexable.<p>Is there a solution or is this an unaddressed pain point?",
