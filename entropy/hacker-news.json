Wanted a board I could glance at and see project specifics we&#x27;re working on.<p>Board holds 5 slats. Design the paper inserts for the slats how ever you&#x27;d like; jira #, trello #, whatever. Print the slats in whatever color works for you - red = critical, yellow is falling behind, white is going well, etc...",
