(500ms, 1s, etc)?<p>- If the retry mechanism takes too long, the user will get bored and refresh the webpage which could have a negative impact. How should we handle this? Should we not implement retries in the back-end at all? Or should we just make sure that the retry mechanism doesn&#x27;t take too long? In your experience, how long is too long for the user?<p>Thanks",
