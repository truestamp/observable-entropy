I felt it was a great fit and they even exceeded my salary expectations in the verbal offer so I accepted it by mail the same day.<p>However, I missed to ask about details of the contract and how long it will take them to sent me a written offer (or maybe that information bypassed me in the talk about the offer).<p>Did I screw it up by accepting the offer? Should I have asked more questions &#x2F; details. Does it look poorly if I check back with my recruiter the day after to ask for a time-frame when I can expect a written offer?",
