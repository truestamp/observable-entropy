      "text": "Some younger companies like Coinbase[2] and Stripe[1] are sharing numbers that they are not hiring much in the Bay Area anymore.<p>I am assuming that many positions that require the candidate to (eventually) relocate to the Bay Area are not getting a lot of traction. A fried of mine refused to interview for position like that despite being very junior! She decided the cost of living is not worth it.<p>What all of this means for the Bay Area talent pool and job market? Talent in the Bay Area are fetching astonishing pay ($600k for L6)[3] which I believe contributed to the out of the ordinary housing market in the Bay Area when you compare it to other cities in CA like San Diego and Los Angeles. I know many older talent have grown roots in the area. They have kids and friends which means they can&#x27;t easily move. What if with this new wave of remote work acceptance, Bay Area pay won&#x27;t match the expenses? Companies can hire everywhere in the U.S. for arguably the same talent quality. Some companies are even expanding to Mexico City[3] and other countries which might put even more pressure on Bay Area salaries.<p>Are we at an end of decades of continues growth and competition in the Bay Area? Will there be big pay adjustments?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;brian_armstrong&#x2F;status&#x2F;1481129589761998857\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;patrickc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1480647701221896195\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lyft.com&#x2F;careers#openings?location=mexico%2520city%252C%2520mexico",

I&#x27;ve heard about and have worked on projects where there were no daily meetings, no discussion about technology across the team, and it was kind of free-form till the due date. Enforcing rules on data scientists often backfires with their productivity too.<p>How do you tackle such a problem in strictly research &amp; development areas?",
