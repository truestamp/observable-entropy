      "text": "Hey folks, my friends and I have been working on a text chat app that matches you to someone you disagree with (anonymously) in a 1-on-1 chat. Imagine Tinder, but about any topic you care about!<p>It&#x27;s just once a week, and matches come out Saturday at 11 AM PST. It&#x27;d mean the world if you checked us out (it&#x27;s our first week!).<p>Here&#x27;s the link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;dissonant&#x2F;id1578399632, or just search &quot;Dissonant&quot; on the IOS app store.<p>--<p>Here&#x27;s the questions for this week (set by us for now, user-submitted soon. Comment what you&#x27;d like to talk about for next week&#x27;s round):<p>1. Is Microsoft’s move to make their library more accessible (making games available on PC, Xbox, and Switch) a bad business decision?<p>2. Are Manchester City and PSG “ruining football” with their lavish spending on player wages and the transfer market?<p>3. Should the Lakers’ championship in 2020 be worth less because it happened in the “bubble”?<p>4. Is Helium Blockchain (the peer-to-peer router) legit?<p>5. Should we do we anything about the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan?<p>6. Are you going back to the movie theater any time soon?<p>7. With remote work and Covid, is being in SF still important to the startup community?<p>8. Should Louis CK go back on tour following the #MeToo allegations around him?<p>9. Is saying no to friendships you don’t want, even if it’s really needed by the other side, okay?<p>10. Is the increasing popularization of EDM a sign of the future of music?",
