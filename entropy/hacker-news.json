No online ticketing\n- my first two calls were interrupted after 30 and 40 minutes, respectively\n- my third and last call, which lasted more than an hour, resulted in a ticket number<p>It seems to me that a previously expired domain name being enrolled into MS 365 should be a common use case with a more streamlined support process.",
