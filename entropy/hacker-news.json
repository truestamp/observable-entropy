      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;m looking for a CSS framework for an industrial&#x2F;embedded control application. All I can find are CSS frameworks with large spacing inside and between elements. Unfortunately that leaves a lot of unused whitespace. I&#x27;m looking for something with a more &quot;technical&quot; touch, with high information density. The closest thing I found is flakes (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getflakes.com&#x2F;), which has a modest look but still isn&#x27;t very &quot;dense&quot;. Are there alternatives?",
