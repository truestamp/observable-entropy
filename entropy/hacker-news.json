      "text": "Hello HN, I&#x27;d like to use my own server to host a new service, accessible through an API, for an application (Win&#x2F;Android&#x2F;iOS) that I wrote and that already has users. No web frontend is necessary. Just the service that my app calls through an API.<p>So far I have relied on Google Cloud (App Engine, Cloud functions, etc..) to run these kinds of things but for the new service I find that Google Cloud is too limited. It also requires Mac computers with M1, running Monterey.<p>My question is: how do I get started setting up my own server(s)? I found numerous tutorials for setting up web servers but I don&#x27;t need a website &#x2F; frontend. Just the service with an API. I would also like to have some amount of scalability and protection against DDoS and similar attacks. Is this possible?",
