As is the API if I&#x27;m honest.<p>But the setup, configuration and maintenance of a Storybook project can be a PITA. In fact, I&#x27;ve rarely seen a Storybook initiative last beyond a couple of months.<p>They often fall over because a minor version update breaks stories in a subtle way, or because fundamental, necessary dev changes renders a number of the stories inoperable...<p>What I would like, is a similar product, but with a little more stability. Perhaps the instability is a testament to it&#x27;s popularity, but for me at least, it seems like most of the problems I have with the app, have nothing to do with the problems I&#x27;m trying to use Storybook to solve.",
