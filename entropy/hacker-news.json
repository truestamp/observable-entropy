      "text": "I built software to help me understand and better organize my thoughts. It works as an automated system that will call me and read a script, and respond based on voice input. It uses text-to-speech and speech-to-text to adapt responses to what I say.<p>For example, I can go through a script to help me prioritize my day and what to work on. Since I clarify my thinking best by speaking, it works well, and the script being read out keeps me on track and accountable.\nThe app also transcribes my answers so I can easily refer back to them.<p>I&#x27;m curious, Hacker News - is this something you would find useful? How would you like to use it; what types of scripts would you write?",
