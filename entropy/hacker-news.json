I have been seeing plenty of developers create game and pour their heart and soul in development and marketing.<p>I heard about influencers who fail and get depressed, but since game development has become so accessible I wonder if this is happening to developers, too.<p>It&#x27;s clear to me what I need to do to promote my game (new trailer, contact the press, social media posts etc.), but it takes forever to get myself to do it because I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be good enough or it would fail for whatever reason.<p>I guess you get the initial rush when some people purchases the game in the beginning. Until you realise it wasn&#x27;t enough. Have you had similar experiences? Any thoughts?",

After that I worked for two months, most of the last two months work was experimentation and none of it was completed. I in emails said yes I will complete task before any more payment but I did spend time on Those tasks. \nNow they are saying to pay them back the last invoice I had as all the previous work has bugs and they won’t pay for any new one as nothing is completed.\nThey are threatening to sue me if I don’t pay last invoice",
