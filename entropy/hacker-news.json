      "text": "Hello all,\nI am a current Java backend engineer, but I am taking an OS course and I am really enjoy it.<p>I am still very junior (YOE 1.25) but I am thinking of making a job jump to a systems programming SWE position.<p>I know Microsoft and Apple have positions obviously doing OS stuff, but any other companies I should consider?  I think my preference would to be a bit higher than embedded engineering, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule those out completely.<p>I should mention I have experience (in my free time, not work experience) in C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;Go.  I don&#x27;t do any objective-C or Swift so I don&#x27;t know if Apple would be an option.<p>Thanks!",
