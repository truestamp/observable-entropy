      "text": "A while ago i took the decision to push the restart button in my life and start all over again. I started to study CS at a university in greece and next month i will live in the university rooms, where generally only poor students get in. I&#x27;ll be living on my own (away from home) for the first time.<p>I&#x27;m dyslexic without any meaningful help. School made me hate books, studying, knowledge. I wasn&#x27;t a good student. The only reasons i didn&#x27;t fail was because the teachers liked me and generally everyone got a good grade. Only after finishing highschool i started loving reading books and then learning. It seems that the fire was there, it became very weak, but didn&#x27;t disappeared.<p>The internet saved me. It gave me an environment where i was able to understand that many things in my life weren&#x27;t normal. Gave me references. I wish  was like the kids who wrote code from a small age and grew there knowledge and curiosity, but at that time i couldn&#x27;t for many reasons.<p>Currently i&#x27;m in a place where i fight my old past and mental health demons, trying to learn how to be organized (todolists, obsidian journal, calendar, etc), making new habits and tearing down old was ones, and find resources to teach myself how to study, especially how to study with dyslexia and mental health issues.",
