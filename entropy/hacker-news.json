      "text": "I started submitting IOS (&amp; Android) apps 8 months ago for clients (Fitness &#x2F; workout apps). Apple is extremely random with dealing with updates and submissions.<p>We would often update multiple apps at the same time, same codebase, just different content. It&#x27;s almost always that half always gets accepted, half always gets a random remark<p>In the end things always gets fixed. But it often takes up to a week to clear things up.<p>Since we know the standard objections we already provide answers for them in the notes, but it seems they don&#x27;t get read.<p>It somewhat feels like an official policy of Apple to randomly make the live of the Developers hard, maybe to weed out the nonsense?<p>It makes the whole submission and update process tiring, and makes us want to circumvent Apple as much as possible.<p>Any tips on how to submit, what notes to add, to make everything go smoother?",
