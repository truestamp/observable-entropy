      "text": "Hello everyone<p>I&#x27;m looking out for a new primary workstation and I&#x27;m considering either a new laptop or a desktop machine.<p>Currently I&#x27;m switching between a Macbook Pro (mid 2014 17&quot; that still is sufficient, but showing it&#x27;s teeth) and a Lenovo T470p.<p>The reason why I&#x27;m considering a desktop machine is because I actually never my laptops &quot;mobile&quot;, whenever I sit down to do serious work I&#x27;m at my desk.<p>Given the current trend of MPB&#x27;s with huge specs and associated huge cost, it seems foolish to me that we as developers spend that much money on what is basically a desktop machine. A machine that makes compromises due to thermals and power efficiency while actually being a desktop machine.<p>My current idea is to buy a cheap ultra portable laptop for true mobility, where performance isn&#x27;t an issue. And a beefy desktop machine for my main workstation. \nTo me this seems as a good situation, but I almost never see it &quot;in the wild&quot;. Every developer has a power horse mobile workstation that they keep tethered to their desk.<p>Am I missing something and what are your ideal setups in such a situation?",
