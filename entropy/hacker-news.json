      "text": "With the looming prospect of a 100T parameter GPT-4 on the horizon, likely happening this year, I&#x27;ve started to reflect on how we appear to be arriving at something of an endgame in technology and perhaps even societally. Given what GPT-3 was already capable of doing, GPT-4 can probably be expected to take things uncomfortably close to the asymptotic limit. And that foundation model will then feed into all kinds of other applications (e.g. Copilot on steroids).<p>Several of the people involved in developing transformers at Google Brain have now migrated to a new company called Adept (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adept.ai&#x2F;), which is aiming to push as close as possible to AGI for essentially any computer use (RPA taken to its natural conclusion).<p>The robotics space is also now saturated with competitors racing against one another. Some of them, such as Miso Robotics, have already reached meaningful adoption.<p>I find it odd that people are so worried about nuclear devastation, climate change, etc when what we really should be concerned about is impending societal collapse. It feels like the upper bound on time to functional obsolescence of the vast majority of humans is 10-15 years.<p>Does anyone else feel scared about the future? Does anyone even care? I can barely wrap my head around the moral implications here in deciding whether or not to have children, let alone all the things about our society that are liable to descend even further into chaos.",
