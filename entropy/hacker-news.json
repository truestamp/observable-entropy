      "text": "I applied internally to another team (for a 1-level bump and $20K extra comp) and got the job, but HR shot me down and wanted me to move across at the same level, no changes in comp.<p>When pressed, the other manager (who talked to my manager, with both being supportive) let leak that HR did not want to raise my level any further due to my location in Europe.<p>I have been here for four years and got steady raises and level increases throughout (ranked in top 3 performers for a team of 25).<p>Am overall royally frustrated by this, since it likely means it&#x27;s implicitly the end of my career track.<p>I vested yesterday, so am considering leaving for a smaller company and saving myself the aggravation altogether.<p>What would you do?",
