What do they do? What do they use?<p>For instance I&#x27;ve never installed apps which require &quot;Find accounts on the device&quot; (android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS) because the permission allows an app to find all the accounts on my device (normally an email addresses, including your primary google account, but that can be anything including your phone number, unique IDs in various services) and do anything with them.",
