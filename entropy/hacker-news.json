      "text": "Next year I am going to apply to YC for the first time ever and I am currently working on my MVP and following the great videos&#x2F;articles available at startupschool.<p>As far as I can see, VC strongly wants you to have a Delaware C-Corp and the guys at YC strongly suggest that too for the same reason.<p>What concerns me is that they don&#x27;t really tell you when this is going to be required, and what are the consequences of filing that legal paper (probably because it is well known and written in the state&#x27;s legal papers).<p>As you might imagine I&#x27;m a fresh MSc graduate in computer science that wants to dive in this startup world but don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend. My question therefore is: what if I don&#x27;t get accepted into YC? Should I really sign a piece of paper that could get me in trouble [1] (in particular this comment [2]) before even getting a solid investment?<p>I get their point, they encourage to do it as soon as possible not just for the legal part but also because, in that way, you establish yourself as a startup with legal HQ in Delaware and secure every possible transaction&#x2F;source code of MVP and other legal stuff that you are going to need even without investments but I want to be prepared for every possible outcome and get a (almost) clean exit if the startup doesn&#x27;t take off as expected.<p>So my final question is: should I create a Delaware C-Corp before getting accepted into YC?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28076871<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28093279",
