I somehow managed to keep my phone charged, through two marriage ceremonies in a still-very-rural village in India, by inserting the type C connector of Apple’s <i>brave</i> charging cable in those phones’ type C ports and slow-charging my iPhone which for some reason would always stop at 69% no matter which phone I’m drawing power from.",
