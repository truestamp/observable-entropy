In a way, this was a very selfish goal, I have only confused on myself.<p>However, today I realised what separates me and our boss (Of course, he&#x27;s more experienced and has more knowledge. It&#x27;s not even comparable). My boss helped and helps everyone on my team and the company to grow on a large scale. I would like to help others grow. I can&#x27;t think of anything because knowledge wise, they&#x27;re already superior.<p>I highly value your reply. Please share anything, tips, experiences; Big or small.",
