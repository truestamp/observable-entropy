We are pretty mixed up though due to mixed signals from all of them (UK: Brexit, Germany: difficult language, Switzerland: cost of living).<p>One thing we know is that we don&#x27;t want to go to Ireland or something close to it. Great job market but high cost of living and public services not close to taxation (we were not happy especially with health and education). We have a small pre-school kid. So, if we learned anything from there is that we&#x27;re willing to exchange a higher taxation rate with good public services.<p>Anyway. I&#x27;m curious. Which country in EU would you consider under similar circumstances.<p>Thanks",

I am a few months away from releasing a product that could possibly disrupt the market of tech giants who have been at it for decades (the alpha testing results seem promising). If indeed I am successful, I was wondering what kind of harassment to expect. I imagine they would start off by trying to buy me out at a very very small price, and I expect I would refuse it, which might not sit well with them etc. I have no idea how corporate power play works. I think this might be an interesting discussion.",
