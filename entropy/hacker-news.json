      "text": "Hi guys. I&#x27;m from Ukraine. I&#x27;m a novice Android developer. And this is my third app on Google play called Word Search. Don&#x27;t judge strictly) It took me about 3 months to develop the game. You can say that such games are already available in Google play. You&#x27;re right, but in my game you can create word puzzles yourself and send them to friends. Will they be able to pass them? The game also supports 6 languages and contains more than 1000 levels. As you progress, chapters of the story that I wrote and much more will open up to you.<p>Google play: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=sav.max.searchwords",
