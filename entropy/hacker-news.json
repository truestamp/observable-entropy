      "text": "It seems like I made a big mistake not moving to Austin in 2020. Housing prices are off the hook in Seattle. Most of the inventory is old shitty houses, that  need a lot of $$$, love and care to make then livable, let alone worth it for the price.<p>Austin seems to be becoming THE city, lot of good housing, great food, music, comedy and other events. Drive-able to other big cities in Texas. All major tech companies now have offices in Austin. I was there last year, and it was crazy to see everything open people having a great time, while Seattle was still under lock down.<p>Did you move to Austin? Other than the hot summers what don&#x27;t you like about it?",
