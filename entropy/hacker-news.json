      "text": "Hey HN - I built a Chrome extension that adds a button to LinkedIn, Indeed, and Lever to autosave the job&#x27;s title, company, and link in a Google Sheet so you can organize all your job applications in one location. I used to open a bunch of tabs to apply for jobs that I never ended up applying to bc I was either lazy or it got too messy to keep track of. AKA I never went back to that tab again<p>The job hunt is stressful enough &#x2F; it&#x27;s easy to get discouraged when Chrome loads 50 tabs for LinkedIn and Indeed postings that have expired when you finally get to it. I figured I&#x27;d try to build something to make the process simpler.<p>The extension has really helped me navigate my own job search. (BTW it got approved by the Chrome store yesterday ). I wanted to share it with anyone looking for a simple and beneficial tool.<p>What&#x27;s great about this extension:<p><pre><code>  - It&#x27;s free forever - just trying to help people find a job\n\n  - No sign up needed - works with your Google account\n\n  - Saves job postings directly to Google Sheets\n\n    - You can customize and edit the spreadsheet however you want\n\n  - Integrates with LinkedIn, Indeed and Lever\n\n    - Adds a button on the website - no more switching between tabs or copy&#x2F;paste\n</code></pre>\nI hope this helps at least a few people with their job search :) If you do try it, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on how it can be improved!",
