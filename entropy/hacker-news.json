      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;ve been using Let&#x27;s Encrypt for HTTPS certificates and I think it&#x27;s great.  However, the ease-of-use means that anyone who can get my DNS pointed to them (briefly) could request a certificate.  Alternately put, if anyone can become a MITM (cose enough to my end of the network topology), they should be able to request a valid certificate to hide that fact.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is a real concern.  In practice it means Cloudflare, or Amazon, or my ISP would probably need to be complicit.<p>Are there any services that monitor issuance of HTTPS certificates?  For example, if the CAs (Let&#x27;s Encrpyt and DigiCert and Comodo etc) all publish a firehose of issued certificates, then this service could take the domain that I own, send me an email whenever anyone issues a cert for my domain.  I imagine the publishing side of this might not even exist, and I don&#x27;t know how you would audit that _all_ CAs are publishing.<p>Do any of you know if something like this exists? Or is this another solution in this space that people rely on?<p>Thanks!",
