      "text": "I ran into this problem a couple of times on Android where I have misplaced my phone and was trying to use the Google Find my Phone app on my Spouse&#x27;s phone to locate it and have it play a sound. It used to work fairly well before - once even when I left the phone in a cab. Now it asks me to 2FA login using - you guessed it - verification on the misplaced phone or SMS before it will let me login. This is such a counter-feature that makes the Find My Phone app effectively useless",
