      "text": "I&#x27;ve been tasked with making changes to a project with 50,000+ lines of code, I&#x27;m pretty new to Scala and I&#x27;m finding it damn near impossible to keep track of the hundreds of classes and remember what all their attributes are. I&#x27;ve tried using sbt console as a REPL but it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to load the project if it&#x27;s composed of sub-projects.<p>Is anyone willing to share tips about their development workflow? Is it possible to use breakpoints and&#x2F;or step through code to be able to inspect objects at a particular point? I&#x27;ve tried IntelliJ but I can&#x27;t seem to plug in my arguments.<p>Thanks in advance!",
