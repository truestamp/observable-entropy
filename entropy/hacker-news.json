      "text": "Like everyone else it seems, I just got my covid rescue dog, woo!<p>Took him to the vet, they scanned him and gave me his tracking chip number. That led me down the rabbit hole. There are 50+ services out there. Some are free, some are not (where you have to pay to update your address!? so very scammy).<p>Some websites are well designed, some are a train wreck. Some are connected to the American Animal Hospital Association [1] (which seems to be a central database, which then searches some subset of the total number of databases).<p>There also seems to be a whole paranoia about these chips [2], which I find fascinating. It is right up there with the Bill Gates vaccine tracking chip.<p>All in all, this seems like a complete mess that is ripe for disruption. If my dog is lost, finding his tracking number might depend on what database is searched! Registering for a bunch of sites also seems like a weird thing to do. What is your experience with this HN?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaha.org&#x2F;your-pet&#x2F;pet-microchip-lookup&#x2F;microchip-search&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foundanimals.org&#x2F;microchip-register&#x2F;#microchip-and-register",
