      "text": "Like most of us here, I&#x27;ve absolutely loved programming since I was a kid. And I did programming. A lot.\nA couple of years ago I joined a PhD program in AI. I liked the science, but I dropped out after realizing I didn&#x27;t really like working that way.<p>Current status: I feel I completely lost any interest in any kind of tech. Programming lost its magic. I can&#x27;t stand the people considering their tech-related opinions as facts. I can&#x27;t stand the childish &quot;here&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t like tech X&quot; articles (I guess I&#x27;m doing the same?). I can&#x27;t stand self-proclaimed &quot;experts&quot; of the next js framework which will disappear in 2 years. Seems pointless.<p>So how do you renew your interest in tech?",

      "text": "This question has been used as a &quot;gotcha&quot; by opponents of gender theory and gender reassignment. It&#x27;s not an issue I&#x27;m particularly passionate about, but this question did stump me and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time thinking about it.<p>Most dictionary definitions of woman define it essentially as an adult human female. Female, being a sex, would cause this definition to make it so that trans-women <i>aren&#x27;t</i> technically women, and many people perceive that as a problem. But I, and my social circle, has been unable to think of a inclusive definition that still made sense.<p>Here are some of the forms of answers I&#x27;ve seen to this question:<p>1. Answers that include the word in its own definition. &quot;A woman is someone who identifies as a woman&quot; etc.<p>2. Answers that define by exclusion &quot;A woman is a gender that is not man or non-binary&quot; etc.<p>3. Answers that categorize instead of define. &quot;A woman is a social construct.&quot;<p>4. Avoidance. &quot;It&#x27;s not for me to define what a woman is&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of smart, reasonable people here. How do you tackle this problem? What&#x27;s your answer?",
