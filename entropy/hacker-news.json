For the last few years however I&#x27;ve largely worked on React SPAs. \nDuring this time I&#x27;ve largely enjoyed the React component model and certain aspects of CSS in JS which I feel I&#x27;m going to miss when working on the new project.\nAs a result I&#x27;ve been doing some cursory exploration into web components (specifically Lit) as a means of replicating some of the benefits of React that I&#x27;ve grown accustom to but in a more &#x27;traditional&#x27; environment.\nI&#x27;m curious to know however if anyone has experience of Web Components &#x2F; Lit and if this a valid option in 2022.",
