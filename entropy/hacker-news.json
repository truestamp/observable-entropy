      "text": "Brex builds software and financial products for growing businesses. For a long time, weâ€™ve been trying to balance UI simplicity while serving an increasingly diverse client base, including those who are more technical. We think our new API helps Brex solve both needs and puts our clients in control of their financial data. We wrote this blog to share how we shifted our technical and cultural architectures along the way (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;building.brex.com&#x2F;building-the-brex-api-52dcb26cacc8).  Happy to answer your questions and hear your learnings as well.",
