      "text": "Hi.<p>I apologize in advance, but it looks like it&#x27;s my turn for social media big tech support.<p>I had a situation where OVH abused a PayPal authorization to charge me 1200€ for a &quot;private cloud&quot; credit I never asked. OVH refuses to refund me changing the reason for it every time, but well, that&#x27;s another topic.<p>I filed a PayPal dispute, I added exchanges with OVH as evidence, where the constantly insist on me having this &quot;credit&quot; still available for me to use, and my insisting on not wanting it for any purpose (the 12€ I added were enough for my test) and not having ordered it.<p>Finally, PayPal ruled in favor of OVH claiming that I &quot;never provided documentation to prove this credit&quot;.<p>Not only I did (OVH messages), but nobody asked me for evidence at any point: I could have provided extra information&#x2F;screenshots where it is shown. I am positive OVH was requested multiple times for documentation to support their claims, but that was never the case for me, not sure if that&#x27;s normal.<p>Now I&#x27;m stuck with an absurd amount of credit on a cloud service I have no use for, and apparently there&#x27;s no UI option for me to contest this PayPal ruling.<p>Other than lawyering up and contacting consumer protection organisations, what else is there to do? Anyone at PayPal can give me a hint?",
