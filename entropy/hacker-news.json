      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;ve had a solidly okay go at being an engineer thus far.  I took a year off in school to work in the bay area and fortunately decided to return to school and get my degree.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on some cool things at a few startups, but I&#x27;d describe myself as a slightly above average engineer.  I got to work on some awesome greenfield elixir stuff at my last gig, however the org sort of fell apart after failing to transition to full-remote.  I was able to secure a 30% raise at a new growth stage org, (still being paid less than I think is standard in NYC for 3YOE but that&#x27;s okay).<p>Basically, I&#x27;ve hit my current cognitive bound for my &quot;intermediate&quot; experience.  I can do cool things, stuff well above what&#x27;s available in documentation etc etc, but I still yearn to have the technical prowess to architect bigger and more complex things.  Getting to work with event-sourcing code has been interesting, but my new gig although it pays well isn&#x27;t really challenging me.\n  It seems like I&#x27;ve been passed for interviews because of this too?\nI can&#x27;t tell if this is because I&#x27;m a bad employee and the org doesn&#x27;t trust me or if I just picked wrong and ended up stagnating my growth that way?<p>My catch 22 dilemma here is that I sort of suck at leetcode interviews, but in order to learn from a more advanced org with bigger challenges &#x2F; opportunity I first have to be able to actually land an interview and pass.  If I can&#x27;t do that I feel like I should do product stuff, but obviously you have to get a product gig before you can really apply for those roles.<p>Thankfully, I&#x27;m located in NYC so there&#x27;s plenty of opportunity here.  I&#x27;m feeling a bit lost, because if I can&#x27;t realize too much of it what&#x27;s the point of living here after all?  Admittedly, part of this is wanting to maximize my value and grow at the same time - I&#x27;m sort of worried that I might never reach the ability required to say even get a lowly gig at Bloomberg or something bigger than a series C startup?<p>Apologies if this sounds like a stream of consciousness - really looking for some guidance from people smarter than me &#x2F; with more experience.<p>Let&#x27;s hope 2022 is a better year ahead!",
