It usually takes a lot of time and money to integrate data science tools into businesses, especially for SMEs, from hardware investment and management to hiring and training costs as well as developing machine learning models. We take care of all of that with our zero-code Cloud Data-Science Web Application at a fraction of the original cost. We have first launched our prototype within the financial services industry (e.g Banks, Fintechs, Mobile money), with the aim of aiding financial services with the detection of fraudulent transactions using machine learning and Biometrics Facial recognition for remote customer digital unboarding. Our goal is to provide a library of prebuilt tools to address different problem areas of the financial service business, from fraud to customer care, marketing, and risk management. In the future, we plan to provide other solutions for E-Commerce, Logistics, Government offices, and other data-driven businesses in Africa. We are currently in the beta testing phase with a major local bank. We basically hope to do for data science what Weebly did for websites, making it easier and more accessible to anyone.",
