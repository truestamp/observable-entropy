      "text": "I recently started working at a startup whose code was developed under very intense business pressure. This combined with the attitude towards code needing to &quot;work&quot; and not code needing to be qualitative has lead to a messy codebase. One can argue that at least if the code _does_ work then it&#x27;s ok, but we&#x27;re dealing with many errors daily. Luckily we do have sentry and continuous deployment set-up (no CI though), so these errors can be fixed quickly when they are seen.<p>Needless to say, we don&#x27;t have any tests.<p>The code is messy in most places, not all. We&#x27;re working on improving the codebase, but I still feel like I&#x27;m not very well equipped to work in functions that has 10s of database queries, over 100 variables, nested if-statements, and if-statements with 5 or more checks all over the place.<p>I&#x27;m trying to learn testing, but under these circumstances it&#x27;s still kind of difficult.<p>The positive side is that I do get a lot of time to read, research and learn, and I do get the freedom to try things out if they provide some form of benefit for us.<p>I consider myself a medior in terms of experience, this is my second job in programming.",
