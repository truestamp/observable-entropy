      "text": "The idea comes from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29868302 .<p>Basically, epaulson says that their company would pay for a company to handle Linux packaging, vetting all of the packages, if some liability is accepted by the vendor. It interests me, and I would like to see if anyone would pay for it.<p>(If I did this, the liability I would accept would be that the contract would be extended, for free, for the length of time that the customer was affected by a broken package. Please comment if your have other ideas for how liability could be accepted, especially if it&#x27;s how your company would want it done.)<p>Obviously, I would do as epaulson suggests: give back to the FOSS that I am packaging, probably based on number of users. This would help protect <i>me</i> from people like Marak (see recent threads about colors.js and faker.js) while also giving back to Open Source.<p>My question is this: could you convince the people in control of spending at your current employer to pay for this vetted packaging service? Crucially, this is <i>not</i> about whether <i>you</i> would pay, unless you are C-level and&#x2F;or do choose how to spend funds; in that case, please comment so if you can.<p>Bonus points if you comment with how much your company would pay (or contact me [1]).<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gavinhoward.com&#x2F;contact&#x2F;",
