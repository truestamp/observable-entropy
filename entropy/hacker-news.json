      "text": "It&#x27;s been one frustrating week! Got banned after being hacked on facebook. I have a page with over 20k followers on our IG account and close to 20k likes on our FB page and all IG accounts linked to my personal account have been disabled. Not only that, I was banned from advertising and the hackers used $4000-$5000 ish in ads that was funneled out of the PayPal account connected to it. I want to dispute it with PayPal and the bank but have no one of seeing what was exactly &quot;advertised&quot; with the spending costs because I cannot log in. Ridiculous. We&#x27;ve spent well over 6-figures in advertising over the last decade or so and the business pages being disabled cripples our online presence (not to mention, losing photos and connections from my own personal account I&#x27;ve been using since 2006-2007).  This is also a family business that is our livelihood.<p>If you know anyone from Meta&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Instagram that can have some empathy and a heart to help (or if you know someone you can forward this to), please reach out to me at roger@petzonesd.com.\nI feel everyone&#x27;s suffering and frustration here. Account got disabled for going against community standards by the hackers and not a single thing can be done as &quot;their decision is final and cannot be reversed.&quot;",
