      "text": "I&#x27;m currently looking for a new job, and I have a problem: I absolutely hate job interviews. I have an irrational fear of them. I get so anxious I can&#x27;t sleep days before the interview. During the interview, I&#x27;m the worst possible version of myself, and my brain just shuts down. I can&#x27;t answer the basic questions and I make the impression that I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>I have 10 years of professional experience, I have a good CV and I think I&#x27;m actually good at my job. But I don&#x27;t think I will get a job like this. (And I&#x27;m not really looking anymore, because I don&#x27;t want to put myself in that situation again)<p>So I thought: if this is happening to me, it must happen to others!<p>There must be thousands of great developers out there, who don&#x27;t switch jobs, who don&#x27;t apply to a position which they would be a perfect fit for, simply because they loathe job interviews, are shy, introverted or have social anxiety...<p>And companies are missing out on great developers. They are basically filtering out anyone who isn&#x27;t good at interviewing. I get that for some companies or some positions, talking on the phone or per video chat is part of the job. But not for (every) software developer jobs?<p>I know that at least one company, Automattic, is conducting their job interviews via text. So it must work, even on the scale of a company with ~1000 of employees.<p>Maybe there are more?<p>I&#x27;m starting a wait list, and if you are in the same position as me: you want a new job, but you would like to do job interviews via text, please sign up. If there are enough people on the wait list, I will start a new platform, and try to convince other companies use this completely untapped source for new tech talent.<p>Wait list for developers: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLScxkdroJ4NrOZFi_HTwEtR7szPKg4uQE_1WUEH9vuEznOEvZw&#x2F;viewform<p>If you are hiring and are interested in this, sign up here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;e&#x2F;1FAIpQLSePfriC4xwSEUbw8u05UGfLUVpyGBGS79wFInEYrqQnYxPxJA&#x2F;viewform",
