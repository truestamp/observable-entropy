He likes his computer class in school and they do some programming lite games. He also likes taking things apart to see how they work.<p>Are there any good arduino all-in-one kits out there I could get and play around with him so he could see the connection between software and hardware? Want to keep it mostly fun and not overbearing.",

      "text": "A few weeks ago we experienced an outage for a few hours, we got 500&#x27;s from both NPM and Nuget private GitHub feeds. This essentially halted progress in our CI pipeline, so trunk progress ceased for a few hours. Downtime happens. What&#x27;s alarming is that as an enterprise customer ($250&#x2F;user&#x2F;year) we only got a response 11 days later containing, essentially, these things:<p>* &quot;Check again.&quot; If the turnaround on a support ticket is truly 11 days, we would have been facing a 22 day outage (as we&#x27;d expect yet another 11 days after responding &quot;it&#x27;s still happening&quot;).<p>* &quot;You have no SLA.&quot;<p>* &quot;If you want support, I can direct you to our sales team.&quot;<p>If, god forbid, Git access (or everything) had been down, we would have been scrambling to continue business, we wouldn&#x27;t have had a number to call, and we likely would have had to pony up the cash.<p>I strongly recommend you take a good look you fall here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;premium-support. Note that &quot;&lt; 8 hours&quot; under &quot;Enterprise&quot; mean absolutely nothing, as they aren&#x27;t guaranteed (per your contract). A more honest value in the column would be &quot;N&#x2F;A.&quot;<p>You have to get hold of sales to learn about premium support pricing, it isn&#x27;t publicly disclosed. This is likely to prevent you from budgeting for premium support only in the event that you need it.<p>If your business continuity depends on GitHub Enterprise, and you don&#x27;t have Premium support, you need to pay, plan, or change.",
