      "text": "I was very much into black and white SLR photography many years back, shooting manual with b&amp;w film (sometimes developing film myself, but never really enjoyed that side of it so much).<p>I&#x27;m looking to get back into it, and was looking advice on modern digital cameras and software&#x2F;workflows for b&amp;w only photography.<p>I&#x27;ve seen there are now some dedicated monochrome cameras, but they seem hideously expensive for the features, and quite a few years old now (so not sure whether they never caught on, were overpriced, or are so great they didn&#x27;t need improving).<p>Some posts I&#x27;ve read suggest using Fujifilm cameras due to some different sensor filter pattern. Others suggest shooting in color then converting to b&amp;w in software to make working with color channels easier.<p>SLRs seem to be declining a bit in favour of mirrorless cameras, but I don&#x27;t really have any experience with these to know whether they&#x27;re now good enough to fully replace SLRs.<p>It&#x27;s proving a bit tough to search for, so many search results just get me blogs&#x2F;sites filled with ads or affiliate links, so hard to know who&#x2F;what to trust. A lot of focus also seems to be on color performance, video, and autofocus, none of which I care about much (interchangeable lenses are a must though).<p>Any advice or pointers to trusted blogs&#x2F;videos&#x2F;sites etc. would be welcome - I&#x27;ve barely used any digital cameras other than my phone for quite some time.<p>FWIW part of the appeal of b&amp;w to me is its limitations, rather than just an effect to be applied to color photos I&#x27;d taken.",
