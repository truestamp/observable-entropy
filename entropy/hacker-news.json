      "text": "From Dr. Richard Hipp:<p>There is a bug in versions 3.35.0 (2021-03-12) through\n3.37.1 (2021-12-30) which could potentially cause database\ncorruption.  Upgrading to version 3.37.2 (2022-01-06) or later is recommended.<p>## About the bug<p>In order to encounter this problem you must:<p>1.  Change SQLite&#x27;s default behavior so that it stores secondary journal\n     files in memory, rather than as temporary files on disk.  Secondary\n     journals are stored on disk by default.  To move to in-memory storage\n     you need to compile with [-DSQLITE_TEMP_STORE=2 or 3][1] or\n     set [PRAGMA journal_mode=MEMORY][2] at run-time.<p>2.  Use the [SAVEPOINT][3] SQL statement to create nested transactions and\n     sometimes roll back those transactions using ROLLBACK TO.<p>3.  You also need a measure of bad luck, as the problem is difficult to hit.<p>## Recommended fix.<p>The recommended fix for this problem is to upgrade to [version 3.37.2][4].\nIf that is not possible for you, you should at least consider applying\nthe [one-character patch][p1] to fix the problem.<p>## How this bug was created and how it was discovered<p>The bug arose from an enhancement that we installed in response to\n[forum post e78ffd751185a67e][5].  Repeated use of SAVEPOINT and\nROLLBACK TO with an in-memory journal was causing excess memory\nusage.  The fix was to &quot;truncate&quot; the in-memory journals following\na ROLLBACK TO, in order to contain the memory growth.<p>The bug was first discovered (and [reported on this forum][6])\n10 months later by researchers at the\nWingtecher Lab of Tsinghua University.  Using the AFL++ fuzzer with\na custom mutator, they managed to cause an [assert() statement][7]\nto fail.  It turns out that assert() statement existed to verify that\nthe statement journals were operating correctly, and so the failure\nof that assert() statement indicated a possible corruption bug.  Further\nanalysis showed that corruption was possible, though it is difficult\nto hit.<p>This bug is a sufficiently obscure corner case that it might have gone\nunnoticed for many years, had it not been for SQLite&#x27;s heavy use\nof assert() statement to verify internal consistency, and for\nWingtecher Lab&#x27;s ground-breaking analysis tools that found a way to \nget one of those assert() statements to fail.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;compile.html#temp_store\n[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;pragma.html#pragma_temp_store\n[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;lang_savepoint.html\n[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;releaselog&#x2F;3_37_2.html\n[p1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;src&#x2F;fdiff?v1=a85f0dc5c02a4245&amp;v2=ff4336a98b05ede2&amp;diff=1\n[5]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;forum&#x2F;forumpost&#x2F;e78ffd751185a67e\n[6]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;forum&#x2F;forumpost&#x2F;d7338bf4901f1151\n[7]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;assert.html",
