I&#x27;ve found it very useful when supplemented with TV and later chatting&#x2F;speaking with people.<p>I wanted to find something similar for math, just to review and keep myself fluent because I want to eventually go deeper with physics, so I searched around and all I could find was Brilliant.<p>I did a bunch of the samplers they offer but this didn&#x27;t really give me an idea of whether it&#x27;s good or not, I really wish they had a trial or ad supported version or something like that because they basically strong arm you into putting down $100 unless you want to pay 2x or 4x per month for shorter time periods... I just don&#x27;t know if I want it yet or not, so I can&#x27;t justify that.<p>What is other people&#x27;s experience with this thing? Is it worth it? Are there alternatives that are similar to Duolingo (keeps a streak, is gamified, cut graphics, with bite-sized levels, etc.)?<p>[p.s. I&#x27;m not interested in Khan Academy, it&#x27;s slow, imperfect and MIT has lectures up for all of these topics if I want them.]",
