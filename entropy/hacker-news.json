      "text": "In the UK our scientists and politicians tell us a clear message:<p>&gt; Two COVID-19 jabs don&#x27;t work against Omicron, but 3 do, which is why we must get boostered.<p>That makes sense to me and I&#x27;ve already booked an appointment for my 3rd jab. However, I would like to understand this a bit deeper to know what to expect for the rest of my life.<p>Are we saying that people who only get their first or second jab now are essentially very very little to nothing protected against Omicron until they get their third one? If they do have protection after a recent 1st or 2nd then are we saying that the jab count doesn&#x27;t really matter and it&#x27;s about time? Does it mean the mRNA vaccines only seem to work for about 3-4 months after the jab and then fade very rapidly? So we will need a 4th, then 5th, etc.?<p>I read not long ago that Israel is already preparing for a 4th vaccine rollout which would kind of support that idea.<p>Which one is it and what does that mean for the future?",
