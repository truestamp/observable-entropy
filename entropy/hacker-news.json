      "text": "I&#x27;ve made a software that designs hardware based on your requirements and the machine you want to 3D print it with. \nThe idea is to abstract away a lot of the boring details (like tolerances, stress analysis, fatigue, etc...) and make hardware development faster.<p>Of course, it can not make every component (yet). Someone (me, at the moment, but I hope to open it up at some point) has to design a basic &quot;blueprint&quot; but then SOL75 can run with it. The software can manipulate the individual blueprints and&#x2F;or combine them to meet the user requirements.<p>To better understand what it does, there is an open (free) demo you can try at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sol75.com&#x2F;component&#x2F;glider_if<p>More info about the project: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sol75.com",
