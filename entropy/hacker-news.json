      "text": "This is something I&#x27;ve noticed over the last few months. I did previously have an Amazon Music Unlimited subscription but now I use Spotify and have set Spotify as the default for music and podcasts.<p>I will often ask my Alexa to play a song and it will say &quot;This song is only available on Amazon Music Unlimited&quot;, which I know to be false because I&#x27;ll have been listening to the song&#x2F;s in question that day. For example, I asked for the song &quot;Spud Infinity&quot; by Big Thief yesterday.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether this is because the device stores this database internally and is simply out of date, though I&#x27;ve noticed this on much older songs too. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a technical reason and not some conspiracy, though I do find it strange that during the ~3 years I&#x27;ve owned an Alexa it only started behaving like this recently.",
