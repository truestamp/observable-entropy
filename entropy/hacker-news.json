Always an academic person, I intentionally sacrificed many things to make progress in academia, and yet, it didn&#x27;t always work.<p>Didn&#x27;t go to parties; didn&#x27;t date seriously; didn&#x27;t enjoy most of my time; and didn&#x27;t follow all my interests.<p>I&#x27;ve been a long time HN reader and I believe in the wisdom of the HN community.  As someone who&#x27;s still in academia (grad school), what do you think I should do?  I feel like I owe myself a lot, and even though I&#x27;m in a relationship now, I can&#x27;t stop thinking about the opportunities that I missed with girls when I was younger.  I also think about dropping out of the PhD program and transitioning to the industry, maybe because I feel like I&#x27;ll never be appreciated in academia and maybe because I feel like I need a new beginning.",
