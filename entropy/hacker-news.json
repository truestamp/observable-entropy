      "text": "Mysteries of Space have always fascinated me - UFOs &amp; Aliens being the biggest of them all. Are we alone in this universe? Is there any other civilization out there? How do they look? Do they also have governments? Why they have never revealed themselves to us?<p>Questions like these always occupy my mind &amp; I love watching videos and listening to podcasts on this topic. I&#x27;d love to chat with random people who are curious &amp; would love to learn more about their views.<p>A website like Omegle would be a perfect fit for this but sadly Omegle is not built for such stuff. So I thought why not make such a site where curious strangers could connect &amp; discuss anything STEM.<p>What do you think?",
