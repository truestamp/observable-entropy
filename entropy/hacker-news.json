      "text": "I&#x27;ve been doing webdesign for many years for a number of customers. For my own company&#x2F;brand I struggle to create something I&#x27;m really happy with. Having created multiple MVPs to evaluate design decisions and none of them are really satisfying, I&#x27;m looking for a ready-to-use solution. They don&#x27;t have to be free, I&#x27;m perfectly happy to pay for a good product. My company is focused on consulting, software development, project management, testing, etc. The services we provide get billed by the hour (time and material).<p>Because this &quot;project&quot; is already taking too much time I&#x27;m thinking about using a design template that reflects the current Zeitgeist and looks unique enough to be used more or less &quot;out of the box&quot; so I can move on with my life. Maybe some small modifications on the colors and typeface.<p>A lot of design templates I have found are tailored to product companies that have content elements (heros, placement of images, listings, price tables, etc.) to promote a concrete product. I&#x27;ve tried to use such a design template for my context (consulting, not product) but I always end up having to change too much that it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to start with the design template in the first place.<p>I tried to get some inspiration from pages like Behance [1] and the like but very little fits for consulting. I like online tools like the &quot;No-code website builder for startups&quot; from  designmodo [2] but they also seem to be more product oriented.<p>I&#x27;d apreciate some links and tips on design templates for consulting companies.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.behance.net&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;designmodo.com&#x2F;startup&#x2F;",
