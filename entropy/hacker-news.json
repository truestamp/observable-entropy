      "text": "I&#x27;m making a small free web app in Django with bootstrap for frontend for small-size farmers to exchange services in between each others, the app will have no more then a 1000 users. Along the way i stumbled with a lot of problems:<p>* phone version\n* chat in with selected groups of users\n* deployment and security<p>I tried making it in django-rest with vue or using uvicorn and django-chat and even implementing my own chat system but it complicated the whole project a whole lot. Is something like firebase or aws lambda with preact or petite-vue with ionic(for phone version) better for these kind of small apps ? I&#x27;m looking for a different web framework that will have all these things included with minimal code required. I just would like to get it shipped as fast as possible. Do you have any suggestions ?<p>Thanks in advance",

On narrower screen widths it is a small truncated box below the video.  Also top comment is selected by default, so only one comment is going to show on page load.  This screws with full album track listings, requiring a click + reload on all videos to get a really small window to scrolling comments.",
