      "text": "Formal modeling is a mathematical approach for designing and checking correctness of software systems. It focuses on standard software engineering and distributed systems problems of the sort programmers face every day. It takes a pragmatic engineering approach: each problem starts with UML diagrams, design decisions and sometimes even a requirements document. We work through how to get from a whiteboard design to an initial mathematical model. Then we refine it based on logical errors found by the model checker, which return with a level of detail unheard of in a standard debugger. Formal modeling is a skill every engineer should have in their toolbox.<p>All the examples are downloadable, and their is a quick setup section at the start. Additionally, there is an explorable model error debugger build right into the website.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elliotswart.github.io&#x2F;pragmaticformalmodeling&#x2F;",

Then you can make API requests to your new endpoint the same way you would any other HTTP request, and you&#x27;ll receive the response you built!<p>ResBin is completely free to use, and also open source <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dasveloper&#x2F;ResBin\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dasveloper&#x2F;ResBin</a> (repo is work in progress).<p>Currently response bins only last 90 days, but I&#x27;ll likely remove that limitation soon.",
