      "text": "We in the U.S. printed too much money and it&#x27;s making its way through the economic system causing inflation and asset bubbles..<p>Wait, no, the velocity of money is low, stupid, did you see the FRED M1v graph?  It&#x27;s the supply shocks.<p>I&#x27;m looking for some reading recommendations of separate, competing viewpoints on general monetary policy written simply, so that I can read all arguments and the foundational principles of the different economic perspectives (Austrian school, monetarists and so forth), and ideally each item should be as convincing as the other.<p>Even better would be a book that encompasses this debate.<p>Thanks!",
