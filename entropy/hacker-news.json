      "text": "Hello all,<p>We&#x27;ve spent quite some time benchmarking the best fine-tuning techniques for GPT-J at NLP Cloud (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlpcloud.io). Finding the best solution was not straightforward and we had to look at things like speed, server costs, ease of development, accuracy of the fine-tuned model... It took time but we ended up with a nice setup (and we are now officially proposing GPT-J fine-tuning + automatic deployment on our platform).<p>Here are our key takeaways:<p>- The best methodology seems to be the one from the Mesh Transformer Jax team: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kingoflolz&#x2F;mesh-transformer-jax&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;howto_finetune.md\n- Fine-tuning on GPU is not ideal. Even several GPUs used in parallel with Deepspeed can be very slow. We used 4 GPUs Tesla T4 in parallel, and it took 1h30 to only compute our first checkpoint (+ 80GB of RAM used...), for a training dataset made up of 20k examples. Maybe a GPU A100 would be worth a try.\n- Fine-tuning on TPU is very efficient but it takes a TPU v3 because TPUs v2 are running out of memory. It takes around 15mns, for a training dataset made up of 20k examples, which is really awesome.\n- The overall process is not straightforward as it takes several kind of conversions (converting the datasets to the right format, making a slim version of the model, converting the weights to Transformers...)<p>In the end this is worth the effort, because combining fine-tuning and few-shot learning makes GPT-J very impressive and suited for all sorts of use cases.<p>If you guys have different feedbacks about GPT-J fine-tuning, please don&#x27;t hesitate to comment, I would love to have your opinion.<p>Hope you found the above useful!",
