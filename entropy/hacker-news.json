      "text": "Travelling internationally from the US after not having done so for about three years.  I was surprised to get hit with a request to upload all of our passports, a second form of ID, and other documents to the United Airlines portal before travelling in a few weeks.<p>My immediate thought was:  &quot;No way in hell!&quot;.<p>I used to travel internationally at least once a year.  Did so for probably twenty years.  I&#x27;d just show-up at the airport with my passport and flight documents and that was that.<p>My concern:  With all the data breaches and security&#x2F;privacy issues, how intelligent is it to scan and upload such important and detailed information into an airline&#x27;s website or mobile app?<p>Overthinking it?<p>Trust me, I&#x27;m an airline?<p>I am also wondering if this is a legal requirement these days or just the airline trying to be helpful?  In other words, can you opt-out and just go to the airport with your documents?<p>And then the obvious question:  Are they just going to scan the stuff at the airport anyway and store it in the same databases?",
