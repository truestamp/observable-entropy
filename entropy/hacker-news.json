      "text": "Not explicitly tech related, but trying to solve a problem that tech is failing me on.<p>I am looking for ideas of adult-friendly indoor activities, done away from home, that do not cost anything, besides the cost of transportation to get there. An example would be quietly reading books at Barnes and Noble without buying any.<p>Finding any results for such ideas has proven incredibly elusive on multiple search engines, with several dozen variations now including many with numerous advanced operators. Many seem to think I&#x27;m either trying to start a business for free, or trying to entertain kids indoors on a rainy day.<p>Any ideas on other such activities, or search terms that help uncover them? I&#x27;m employed at FAANG as an SWE, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m incompetent using search engines, but I&#x27;m getting nowhere with this on my own.",
