      "text": "This is an old annoyance regarding Chrome Dev Tools &quot;Devices&quot; toolbar. Can we please get an option to import and export device information (resolution, dpr, useragent, etc. - maybe even some nice device frames) for the Devices list in Devtools? I&#x27;m really curious about the logic behind deault choice of devices in the list: why are there no Pixel 6&#x2F;6Pro (c&#x27;mon Google, promote your own devices, maybe!?), iPhone 13&#x2F;Pro&#x2F;Max (aka: latest devices, not ancient models)? And, what about &quot;Show device frame&quot;? Seems to only be available for some verry old models (or Nesthubs - who needs to see that?). Sheesh.",
