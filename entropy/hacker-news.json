      "text": "I typically browse in Firefox with ublock0 and noscript.  However certain commercial sites require too many holes in the filtering and so I will use Edge in &quot;Private Browsing&quot; mode.<p>Today while searching for a product at the Home Depot web site, Kaspersky popped up a message that &quot;Microsoft Edge is using the Webcam&quot;.   I was able to repeat this after closing the browser and then visiting the site again.  That electrical tape over the camera proved its value today.<p>Home Depot has already faced criticism and a lawsuit for using facial recognition in their stores [1]  This seems next-level evil.  Has anyone else encountered this?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbwt.com&#x2F;data-security-law-blog&#x2F;home-depot-joins-facebook-and-others-in-facing-suit-for-scanning-faces",
