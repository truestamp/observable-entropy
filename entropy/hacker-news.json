      "text": "Hello! I&#x27;m struggling to make the move from contractor to agency owner, and wondered if anyone had any advice. I have been working as a contract SDET for a few years through a limited company and I want to start expanding. While I&#x27;ve worked across the stack in both SDET and general dev roles, I have found a niche in testing blockchain products that has gone pretty well and I&#x27;ve easily found my own work as and when I&#x27;ve needed it. What I don&#x27;t know is how to take that to the next level.<p>Has anyone taking the jump from contractor to agency owner? How did you go about it?",
