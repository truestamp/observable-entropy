We use Gmail, Facebook, online banking, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve never found a solution that I can sell to any non-techie family member. 1password and LastPass, Yubikey, etc - while they worked great for <i>me</i> on my PC, they were unusable to my family members whose life revolves around iPhone.<p>What&#x27;s the status in 2021? Assuming money is not a concern, what is the best mix of real-world usability for non-techies, and meaningful increase in security? In particular I want to avoid: Account takeovers; password reuse; ignoring security due to obstacles imposed.<p>Many thanks! :)",
