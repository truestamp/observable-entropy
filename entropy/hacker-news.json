      "text": "In my last project, I was struggling to create and monitor cron jobs.<p>So, instead of creating hundreds of standalone scrips and executing them with cron, I decided to turn those scripts into multiple endpoints. Next, I created a single service that I could schedule HTTP requests to those endpoints and monitor its execution. No more scripts, now everything is endpoints that I can run manually at any time<p>I turned this scheduler service into a Micro-SaaS so you don&#x27;t have to build it yourself: beew.io<p>I know you can Schedule HTTP requests with Zapier but come on... I will not pay 50 bucks for that hahahaha<p>btw, feedbacks are welcome.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beew.io",
