      "text": "Hi all!<p>I found out many people struggle with technical doubts when it comes to starting something new in the digital world. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m open to give a hand to the community.<p>Hope it helps!<p>Questions like:<p>- How much does it cost to develop my digital product (app and&#x2F;or web)?\n- How long does it take to develop? What do the times depend on?\n- Should I hire a freelancer, an agency, or have a programming partner?\n- I need to project costs and I don&#x27;t know how to calculate the maintenance of a system (servers, APIs, stores, services, etc).\n- With what language&#x2F;tool do I have to make my app&#x2F;web?\n- I am looking for a technical partner for my team, what profile does he have to have? Where can I find it? What do I have to look at?<p>Have a great day!<p>Tom",
