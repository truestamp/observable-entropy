      "text": "There are plenty of good resources for how to do domain-driven design, microservices, cloud functions, and event-driven architecture. I understand why these paradigms are useful for rapidly scaling an application. Queueing, the ability to adjust resources per service, and enabling separate teams to build their microservice differently.<p>However, they also add quite a bit of complexity. Using pub&#x2F;sub breaks execution context, cloud functions are difficult to debug&#x2F;test&#x2F;develop locally, etc. I&#x27;m having trouble finding quality dissenting opinions online around this topic. Most resources I&#x27;ve found are geared towards how to implement these technologies properly.<p>In what scenarios would you NOT recommend event-driven architecture?",

For example, I&#x27;ve recently switched to an iPod Classic for a lot of my music listening which has been quite nice.<p>I also spend a lot of time browsing and reading interesting articles, particularly on HN and want to replace some of that with &#x27;offline&#x27; alternatives. When it comes to other hobbies (sports, music) I have found some great magazines still in circulation that can work as alternatives to browsing online.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your suggestions for tech related magazines, ideally things I can subscribe to and get monthly&#x2F;quarterly. These should be varied enough to cover the kind of topics we see here on HN daily as opposed to super general tech news type magazines.",
