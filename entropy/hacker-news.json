Yet all these systems are in company owned VPCs. The limitation is that one of the applications ONLY auths with base64 encode for their API. Halting implementation.<p>I understand concerns as:\n1. Can easily be decoded, so if caught in translation it’s essentially plain text.\n2. Can easily be spoofed from anywhere if creds were compromised<p>But all of this assumes whomever is already in the VPN to even find the targeted endpoint.<p>What’s so bad with base 64 encoding? Even base 64 encoding to generate a token for X hours is a show stopper. Yet from previous consulting experience many large companies are fine with it.",

I don&#x27;t want to spend the time solving a problem if nobody has the problem anymore.<p>If you&#x27;re reading this and work in cloud, could you kindly comment a rough % of what you&#x27;ve seen being spent on raw VMs as opposed to SaaS services, now and historically?<p>Thanks!",
