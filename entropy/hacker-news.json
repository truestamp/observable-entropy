It feels like fb wants to be either the biggest or nothing.<p>But I&#x27;ve serious doubts about metaverse, my eyes get so exhausted from general texting, I can&#x27;t even dream of putting it on for hours at end. At most I can see myself using VR as another monitor or a controller. Something I use for certain entertainment purposes. Even if it was 5x better in tech - resolution, latency, size, etc. I just don&#x27;t see myself wearing anything, i can&#x27;t stand contacts so i wear glasses and i hate glasses too so I take them off when I don&#x27;t need them.<p>Then there is chicken-egg problem: no content cuz no users cuz no content... either fb gives millions of ppl very advanced devices for almost free OR spend more than what netflix have on creating content.<p>Also isn&#x27;t like 95% of the engineers at facebook all mainly web developers or related. And metaverse is basically game development.. something facebook has no experience in. If someone could make a good game it&#x27;d be EPIC (the fortnite creators). Maybe they should acquire or partner up with epic to have some hope.<p>So back to question: since fb seems to be abandoning everything and metaverse is likely to go no where, is fb done for?",
