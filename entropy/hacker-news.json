      "text": "Can a smartphone be of any use if the internet&#x2F;cell service goes down?<p>Most messaging apps depend on having an active internet connection. All modern phones have WiFi mesh and Bluetooth&#x2F;BLE hardware capabilities, but it seems there are very few apps that use them.<p>The existing apps have little overlap across platforms. Bridgeify is the only one that exists on both iOS and Android (although I didn&#x27;t manage to make it work between different platforms).<p>I&#x27;m looking for an app that could help people communicate using their iOS&#x2F;Android phones without internet connection by relaying messages peer-to-peer.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t exist, any ideas why? How would you build one?",
