      "text": "What advice would you give to a new-ish manager who is struggling to move past firefighting and make progress on long term system redesign?<p>For context: I am new to managing managers. This person has been an experienced consultant lead and IC, but has been managing for &lt;1 year. The team is trying to fix issues with a legacy system and incrementally build pieces of the next one, but seems to be constantly swallowed up in firefighting.<p>How should I collaborate with this manager? What’s the right way to help guide forward? (I struggle sometimes to keep track of why there always seems to be 2 steps forward, 1 step back progress around firefighting). I am not sure this person enjoys being a manager and they often seem overwhelmed by the meta tasks (reporting on progress, developing plans, talking to stakeholders, attending meetings) vs actually developing solutions. That said, they’ve built a highly motivated team that seems to be collaborating actively and working together well AND they have great stakeholder trust and relationships.<p>Things I’ve considered:<p>* Asking for clear roadmap and criteria for firefighting, plus a roll up summary of firefighting time over past month.\n* Joining the team as a partial IC to get the lay of the land.\n* Asking what to cut from scope of team to make progress<p>My core management goal is to empower my reports to work independently, but this manager is clearly struggling. I even wonder if they should move back to an IC role instead.",
