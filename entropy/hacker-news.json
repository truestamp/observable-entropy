      "text": "I am looking to setup a landing page for a book I&#x27;m writing. The goal of the page is mainly to pitch the book, collect emails and direct people to purchase the e-book, the print book when it&#x27;s available, and to link to my profile on other social media.<p>I am a backend engineer with very limited frontend skills so I&#x27;d prefer to just pay for something that is simple to set up and, ideally, can handle collecting the emails and managing the list (or at least make it easy to integrate with something like MailChimp).<p>Looking at pricing for starter plans for products that offer this service, I&#x27;m surprised to see how expensive they are. Unbounce is $90, SmartPages is $60, etc.<p>Are there cheaper alternatives? Is my best to do what I can to roll my own, perhaps using a preexisting landing page then and integrating the email capture myself?<p>I don&#x27;t want to get too bogged down on setting this up myself as I prefer to focus on writing the book and I&#x27;m weary of spending a bunch of time trying to create this myself, only to have it end up not looking very good on account of my weak design and frontend skills.<p>Any suggestions on the best route to take? Thanks.",
