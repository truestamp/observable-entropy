      "text": " Greetings fellow founders!<p>For those looking to scale revenue through a more repeatable, efficient Sales &amp; Onboarding process…<p>We’ve spent the past few months at Accord curating playbooks from the WORLD&#x27;S TOP STARTUPS to share with the YC &amp; startup community (from Figma, Productboard, Stripe, Pilot.com , YC peers, etc)<p>Access the gallery for free! (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;inaccord.com&#x2F;playbook-gallery)<p>Why&#x27;d we build this vs just focusing on more product?<p>- After launching last year, we heard from founders:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not a sales &#x2F; onboarding expert, how do I build a winning process to hit my ARR targets??&quot;\n&quot;I don&#x27;t want to start from scratch - who has best practices to use?&quot;<p>- And startup sales leaders:<p>&quot;I need everyone on my team selling like our best rep (proactive, engaging, transparent), how do I align them around our playbook and drive consistency?&quot;\n&quot;How are others doing this?&quot;<p>You can now access all of these insights &amp; winning processes, distilled into easy to use playbooks, for free.<p>Spanning multiple use cases (from sales-led to PLG, and POCs to implementation), and for companies from Seed to hyper growth scale.<p>Whether you’re looking for customer onboarding guides, mutual action plans, or rep training checklists, we’ve got something for you!<p>Hope these are helpful :)",

      "text": "Hey HN,<p>At Hypercontext (S21 &#x2F; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercontext.com) we build an app that helps managers run better meetings by making sure those meetings have an agenda, notes, and goals that tie back to their OKRs.<p>But really we want to help managers become great. So we asked over 500 people exclusively working within tech everything we could to see what we could find.<p>Here&#x27;s what we found:\n1. Unproductive employees are 2.8X more likely not to know their goals. \n2. People know their goals are over 3X more likely to work at a company that’s in hyper-growth.\n3. Discussing your goals weekly increases confidence in hitting them by 2.7x\n4. The 1:1 is the most valuable meeting type (doesn&#x27;t matter if eng, sales, cs, or exec)\n5. Managers who run 1:1s have 1.5x better retention on their team.\n6. Paying below market increases turnover by 1.3x. Paying above didn&#x27;t seem to decrease turnover.\n7. According to their team, the #1 improvement needed for managers is in a clear vision&#x2F;strategy\n8. Meanwhile, managers self report their largest challenge is &quot;not micromanaging&quot;\n9. Gen Z and and Women of color are least comfortable speaking in meetings\n10. People who are not comfortable in meetings are 3x more likely to have applied for another job in the past 6m<p>Full report here, ungated: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercontext.com&#x2F;state-of-high-performing-teams-in-tech",

The databases are updated every 24 hours. \nIt&#x27;s very simple: Parsers VC installs its trackers on the venture capital funds&#x27; websites (namely the startup, team, and news sections) and automatically collects all updates. The data is also obtained from social networks and news sites. Thus, there is no need to wait for the startup or venture capital firm itself to update the information on the aggregator site, all updates appear by themselves.",
