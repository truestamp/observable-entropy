      "text": "Hey HN,<p>We developed LeaksID, the platform that deters leaks of your private documents. Today, we are super excited to launch the new version of LeaksID 2.0 on Product Hunt: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;leaksid-2-0-for-trade-secrets<p>Now, your intellectual property and trade secrets are under your control. Use LeaksID to store all your sensitive trade secret documents, pitch decks, development charts, and know-how in a secure space, and share everything securely. For everyone who receives your document, LeaksID will automatically create a unique copy and add invisible anti-leak marks to it.<p>Potential violators will not dare to leak your documents.\nLeaksID allows you to manage file access and allocate rights, preventing certain users from downloading or printing certain documents.\nIf even a small fragment or screenshot of your document is compromised, you can use LeaksID to identify the source of the leak and stop it.\nSince our last launch, we have made tremendous progress  Thank you for your support and advice. We have heard each of you. We wouldn’t be here without you.<p>Next Steps \nIn the near future we plan to expand the number of supported formats so that you can upload&#x2F;download files in original formats without needing to convert them to PDF. In addition, support for AutoCAD files will be added, allowing you to label diagrams, graphs, and other files containing your intellectual property.<p>We will be happy to receive any feedback from you to improve LeaksID!",
