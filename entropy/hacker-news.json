      "text": "I noticed that the Software Updates page has changed recently (probably within the last week or so).<p>Previously, it would say iOS 14.8.1 is the latest and there are no updates available, with a banner near the bottom to upgrade to iOS 15.<p>As of now, all that is gone. It has been replaced with a page to update to iOS 15.1 as if it was a regular update.<p>So my question is, is Apple planning to remove the option to stay on iOS 14 or are they simply trying to drive up the adoption rate of iOS 15?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve been looking a bit at the news recently about the intel 12th gen CPUs, and how they disable the AVX-512 instruction set if the efficiency cores are enabled. which seemed like a weird and poor implementation that bottlenecks some workloads and leaves quite a bit on the table in terms of performance. Why isn&#x27;t this handled in the scheduler ? all the major operating systems already support the big&#x2F;small core design. Why isn&#x27;t the instruction set requirements simply passed to the scheduler via program headers to dynamically schedule tasks in the most efficient&#x2F;fastest manner?<p>I read a bit up on the topics and there is already research into the topics. so I wonder why the approach intel used is even there. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.cs.ucla.edu&#x2F;~tjn&#x2F;papers&#x2F;pact2018-hybrid-sched.pdf<p>Why isn&#x27;t a better solution used? and why just disable the functionally as it seems like low hanging performance gains from intels side? And isn&#x27;t this a approach to also look into more as modern hardware utilize ASIC style or dedicated hardware for more operations and will so going forward?",
