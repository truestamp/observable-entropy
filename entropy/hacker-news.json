It is basically just &quot;see this beautiful piece, as it actually exists&quot; and &quot;buy it!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m aware of many general options and plenty of technical options, but perhaps there are some HN folks who already do this.  If so, what site&#x2F;service do you use?<p>Online payments are not absolutely necessary, but that would be a nice bonus.<p>There exist sites for photographers to sell their work, but those tend to have many, many options and seem to be overkill for this.  At a minimum, this could probably just be a Shopify store selling individual, one of a kind items.  But perhaps there&#x27;s something better for this (with better presentation)?",
