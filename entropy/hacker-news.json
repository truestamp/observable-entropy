      "text": "We have a &quot;blended stack&quot; app which combines video and printing.<p>Currently our stuff runs on two t2.small servers. One serves the app (has everything). I know we can break it up. What we send out is an app which is just a static build (react) and it can be smaller (it&#x27;s big right now, need to purge Tailwind CSS). We use a postgres backend with Express.<p>Aside from that the video is handled by another party and our second server is primarily for an Apple CUPS instance. This server also handles websocket connections between users.<p>The servers are single CPU, 2GB RAM, not a lot of storage (not really needed for operation, we use S3 to store things).<p>Some ideas to scale are to just serve the front end builds via a CDN&#x2F;from S3.<p>I just was trying to figure out how I could get numbers per server, how many people it could hold. I have seen crazy figures like a single NGINX instance doing 10,000 requests out of the box easily.<p>The printer is the interesting one because the load is in bursts. Not sure what I should cap each machine at even though it&#x27;s probably never really 100% used at any time.",
