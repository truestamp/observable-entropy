      "text": "I&#x27;d like to announce the release of Hist 2.5 &amp; boost-histogram 1.2, the powerful histogramming libraries for Python. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve posted about them here before, so quickly, boost-histogram is a pybind11 wrapper for the Boost.Histogram C++ library, written in close collaboration with the Boost library author, which gives Python users object-oriented histograms with incredible flexibility and speed, multithreaded fills, weighed and mean storages, atomics, manipulations, transforms, drop-in NumPy histogram replacement, and more. It is fully statically typed (newly updated to NumPy 1.21 types). It has been instrumental in pushing forward the tools for binding and building C++14 packages, like pybind11 and cibuildwheel, as well. It was featured at SciPy 2020. Hist is a set of Pythonizations and features on top of boost-histogram to add easier REPL &#x2F; notebook usage, plotting, and extra functionality. You can use axes names everywhere, make stacks of histograms, pie plots, pull plots, convert from pandas, compute profiles from existing histograms, and much more! Both libraries support UHI, a Python Protocol for PlottableHistograms, allowing libraries to support plotting without depending on boost-histogram or hist.\nNew in these versions is Python 3.10 support and wheels (joining the new Universal2 wheels), expanded stack support, extra static typing polish, strict zipping (using Python 3.10 if available), better name and title support, and lots of polish here and there, including better readme and docs. Python 3.6 is no longer supported by Hist.\nBoth projects are part of Scikit-HEP, but like many Scikit-HEP projects (Awkward, iminuit, cookie, etc.), are more generally applicable than just High Energy Physics (HEP). See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scikit-hep&#x2F;hist and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scikit-hep&#x2F;boost-histogram , drop us a star if this is useful for you!",
