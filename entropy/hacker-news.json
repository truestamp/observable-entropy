      "text": "Recently attended a workshop, and I&#x27;m curious to know how you track your finances. Personally, I&#x27;ve built a custom spreadsheet, and I&#x27;m happy with that, but I&#x27;d love to see how other people are doing it.<p>1. Do you use a spreadsheet? Did you build it yourself? Did you buy one that was already done for you?<p>2. Do you use an accounting software (Quickbooks, Xero, Zoho, etc.)?<p>3. How do you like your current solution? Is it too complicated? Is it too overkill in terms of features for your needs?<p>4. What would make it better for you?<p>In the workshop, they recommended also using tracking tools like Mint to follow all your expenses, not just business, but also, personal.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to know how many other people track it all to the penny like this.",
