Cryptocurrency&#x2F;blockchain knowledge like religions, there are good concept applicable and useful in life, there are also tons of bullshit, scam, even violence. I would like to collect sources of knowledge that is not related to any cult non-sense.<p>Knowledge in crypto&#x2F;blockchain stuff I would like to know, for example, what&#x27;s top 5 coins, overall promising regarding transaction rate, fee, market cap, suitable for application (e.g. dapp), technical and philosophical limitation. I have pretty good exploring skills, read a lot of data, but when it comes to knowledge around cult, it takes a lot of energy to filter out greed based statement.<p>Where are secular sources of crypto space knowledge?<p>Thanks.",
