For example, if Google Cloud Storage is down, will Google Artifact Registry go down? and if GAR is down, will Cloud Build be down? I have heard that there are &quot;tiers&quot; of services, with services in a given tier only using services from lower tiers, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find any info on this, even unofficial blog posts or third party analysis. Does anyone know where I can find this info? Or have tips for figuring it out myself?",
