      "text": "I graduated with a CS bachelors degree a few years ago and joined a FAANG right after. I joined a really cool team and I worked my way up to a senior level.<p>While I was in school I really liked research and I thought I could do a PhD in computer science some day. I saved up a bunch of money while working and I can easily “afford” to take a few years off to complete the PhD now. Also, with the pandemic and WFH I had some time to actually complete and send out applications to several highly ranked schools.<p>Now that the acceptances and interviews are slowly trickling in, I’m having some doubts about doing the PhD. I’ve heard horror stories about abusive advisors, mental health struggles, low stipends, burnout, and lack of support systems. I don’t think the PhD will boost my career too much since I’m already in a R&amp;D role at FAANG. Of course I already knew this before sending the applications, but as decision day (April 15) gets closer I’m doubting whether my personal goal of doing a PhD is worth the $1 Million+ opportunity cost and other downsides.",
