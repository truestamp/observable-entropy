      "text": "Google has removed the &quot;Permissions&quot; link on the pages of apps both in the Google Play app (latest version as of 2022-06-07) and on the Google Play website.<p>Not shipping a sample link so I don&#x27;t get accused of trying to promote my app. Go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com and check any.<p>This also applies when trying to install app updates so you cannot easily notice if an update introduces new permissions. (Previous Play versions would even mark new permissions with a green &quot;New&quot; indicator, which helped a lot.)<p>The &quot;Permissions&quot; link was replaced with a &quot;Data safety&quot; link which merely contains something like a privacy policy, not the actual permissions the apps will request.<p>As a consequence, installing an app and using Android&#x27;s own UI to view permissions is the only way to determine the perms now.<p>This implies that if bad apps upload private data right after installation they can frontrun the user&#x27;s chance to review their permissions:<p>The Internet permission does not require manual consent via a popup, and certain permissions which reveal private data such as your phone number&#x2F;identity and accounts on the device also do not require consent. So frontrunning is possible.<p>(IMHO this is not a theoretical scenario: The last time I searched for &quot;flashlight&quot; on Google Play there still was a flood of &quot;flashlight&quot; apps which wanted access to lots of private data, even though a flashlight shouldn&#x27;t need any data at all.)",
