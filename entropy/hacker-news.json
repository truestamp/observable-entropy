Or if the server&#x27;s bandwidth is slow, people from other country will have hard time reading&#x2F;changing the note. or if the server&#x27;s network is banned in certain countries like north korea&#x2F;china people from that country cannot read thenote<p>as the note is stored in a smart contract on the blockchain, no one can change it for 1 hour and anyone on earth can read&#x2F;change it without any third party interference.<p>I&#x27;d love any feedback you have and if you think of anything it doesn&#x27;t have that it should, I&#x27;d love to hear that too.",
