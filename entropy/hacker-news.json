      "text": "I&#x27;m with T-Mobile and I just received a phone call on my mobile phone from another number where everything except for the last 3 digits was exactly matching my own number. I found that suspicious, but I was curious enough to pick up the call. The other person greeted me with &quot;We are very important this is Interpol!&quot; in seriously broken English, so I suspected a spam call and hung up to try to call them back. That didn&#x27;t work because the phone number they were calling me from does not actually exist. Like I immediately get the T-Mobile announcement informing me that this is an invalid number.<p>Now I am wondering:<p>- How can a spam caller call me with a source phone number that does not exist?<p>- Shouldn&#x27;t my mobile phone network verify that the caller - which was also inside their network - is a valid subscriber? Otherwise, how can they bill someone for this call?<p>- How does this kind of scam call work technically?",
