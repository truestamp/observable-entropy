      "text": "I wrote a JavaScript compiler &#x2F; low code framework that can build single page apps pretty quickly in what I believe to be a unique way. I know it has some uses in the real world, but I am unsure how to monetize it or show it off in a way that can land me a better paying job in the future.<p>It has it&#x27;s pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s like most frameworks. It&#x27;s not designed to be the fastest, but allows people to build internal like apps&#x2F; forms quickly with very readable code. I&#x27;m looking for advice on possible next steps I can take to create the best possible outcome without being taken advantage of. (I have heard tons of stories about open source maintainers driven to burnout because of the demands of the masses).<p>If anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks.",
