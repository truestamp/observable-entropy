      "text": "There has been a lot of talk about a historic hot job market for software engineers, but anecdotal evidence suggests that new grads and those with under a couple of years of experience are finding it impossible to break into the industry. It seems like every company wants skilled and experienced engineers and is ready to pay top dollar for them, but no one is willing to invest equivalent resources towards training and mentorship.<p>As someone who is speaking with a handful of people stuck in this situation, what direction should I guide them towards? Are there any job boards for such positions? Does anyone know any companies out there (YC or otherwise) that gives these recent graduates a shot?",
