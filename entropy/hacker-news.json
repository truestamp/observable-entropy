E.g. if the issue we are facing is that &#x27;the performance of the engineering team has degraded over the last X months&#x27; - (not an actual issue just an example) how would you approach identifying and subsequently solving such a broad issue?",

For example on iOS, I don’t have to use third-party libraries for HTTP requests, because URLSession class is enough.<p>On Android, new developers have to choose several HTTP libraries, plus they will encounter different arguments on which one is better and more robust. There is Ktor, Retrofit, Fuel, etc.",
