Specifically, I&#x27;d like to do my part in taking active steps to help fight climate change.<p>I do stuff outside of programming for the environment (not as much as I&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s a bit of a separate issue), but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has thoughts on ways I can use my skills to contribute a cause that is matters a bit more.<p>I&#x27;ve considered contributing to OS projects - but I have no idea what might be impactful and useful to the world generally. Anyone have thoughts on projects &#x2F; specific ways I can put my free time to use programming in this direction?<p>Thanks for any thoughts :)",
