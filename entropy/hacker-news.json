      "text": "Startup founder here and I just want to say that I have gotten so much value from YC, without even getting in. From their videos, articles e.t.c. Even from content from YC affiliated people like PG&#x27;s essays, Michael Seibel, Garry Tan and Justin Khan videos, just to mention a few.\nI am not American and where I come from their aren&#x27;t many people who have done startups and can give you lessons from what they have experienced. Just having access to YC and other great american companies&#x27; products makes me really grateful. What products you ask? Well just to list a few: Stack Overflow, Aphabet&#x27;s products, AWS and many more.\nGetting all this value from all of these companies makes me realize just how much technology can transform lives at scale with way less resources that it would have been otherwise done. As Peter Theil says, &quot;Technology is doing more with less&quot;.\nNow I cannot help but wonder, if I have gotten all these value from YC, from the outside, what about founders who have been accepted into YC? How is it?",
