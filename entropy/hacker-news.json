That is, it pastes the text in with things like the font color and background color, and the font type itself, which then become the styling for the rest of the email if you keep typing as well.<p>Who came up with this? It makes absolutely no sense that anyone would want to transplant styling&#x2F;formatting into an email, where there is no guarantee (indeed, little chance) that it will  mesh well. It&#x27;s just baffling.",
