      "text": "Context: I have been working multiple SWE jobs, remotely, since early in the pandemic. None of the companies know I am doing this. It&#x27;s been very time demanding, but also financially and intellectually rewarding. Some of the companies are FAANG.<p>I want to start a company, but I&#x27;m worried about the potential legal&#x2F;ethical fallout from what I have done. I&#x27;ve kept a low profile so far, but obviously if I start a company I will need do a lot of networking, and people will need to know my background. If my work history is publicly known, there is some risk of litigation from the massive-cap companies that I have worked for.<p>I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve done anything ethically wrong. I work 80hrs most weeks, and received feedback and promotions from each of the companies. I have never breached any NDA or employment agreement, except for the obligatory clause in most salaried contracts: &quot;don&#x27;t engage in any other employment, not even as a cashier at Taco Bell&quot;. That said, it is a legal grey-area, and a well-funded lawsuit could drag on for a long time.<p>The company I want to start would be creating a software product which plugs into, or perhaps replaces one of the products I currently work on (it&#x27;s a very old piece of software). I don&#x27;t believe this would breach any contracts, since other competitors were born out of similar circumstances (minus the overemployment)<p>I wanted to get some other perspectives on my situation. Is it salvageable? Or did I ruin my chances by having a non-conventional work history?",
