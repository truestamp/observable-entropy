It seemed like bad design, but then I went to the same webpage on Safari and noticed that the download button was prominently positioned on the same page multiple times (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adlock.com&#x2F;adlock-for-macos&#x2F;). Do you think this is due to a design issue on the website, or Google actively making it harder to block Adsense?",
