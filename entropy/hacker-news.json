      "text": "I tried out a 30 day trial of Oracle Cloud, decided it would work for my needs for a new company I&#x27;m starting. When it came time to upgrade my account to the paid version, the payment verification failed (I tried multiple times with multiple different cards, they must have blacklisted me).<p>Anyway, thinking it was an error, I tried chatting the support: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;dlf2wQP.png\n(you need a paid account to chat with support, even if you want to chat about paying for your account)<p>Then I tried emailing to see if they could assist: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;T9jkKx7.png<p>I guess this is the type of customer service Oracle provides for customers trying to pay them money (only around $300&#x2F;month to start, maybe not enterprise enough for Oracle).<p>Decided with that last email reply that it&#x27;s not worth starting a new company on Oracle Cloud platform if this is the type of response you get from support.<p>Oh well, back to AWS I go!",
