Downdetector.com and Thousandeyes.com showed an increase in issues for several services around that time.<p>A few hours later, some tunnels haven&#x27;t returned to to service and we&#x27;re experiencing slow connections.<p>I can not find a single status posting or report confirming an outage.<p>Is any one else experiencing issues today?",

      "text": "I&#x27;ve seen a lot of healthy skepticism around web3, and a failure of web3 proponents to provide clear use cases. So I&#x27;d like to provide one: a decentralized exchange, or DEX. A DEX is an exchange in which order matching and execution occurs via smart contracts on-chain, rather than through a centralized entity. That gives DEX’s the following advantages over CEX’s:\n- instant (minutes depending on the chain) and transparent settlement \n- transparent price discovery\n- anyone can provide liquidity and receive a percentage of trading fees, rather than just the exchange getting those fees \n- anyone can list any asset\n- you can custody your own assets<p>However, there&#x27;s a long way to go before DEX&#x27;s are ready for mainstream use. That will occur when: \n- most people receive salary and payments directly to their crypto wallets, so no fiat onramp is needed \n- fees reach parity with CEX&#x27;s due to L2 improvements\n- liquidity reaches parity with CEX&#x27;s \n- social logins are trusted and&#x2F;or a there&#x27;s an optional thin - centralized layer on top of the DEX to help with lost credential recovery\n- impermanent loss risk can be 0 depending on your risk&#x2F;return tolerance  - DODO PMM seems to have solved this? \n- robust risk management algorithms minimize the risk of cascading liquidations during high market volatility \n- chain infrastructure can support millions of TPS during high market volatility<p>Thoughts? Open-minded skepticism welcome!",
