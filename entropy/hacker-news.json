But to my rather security-naive self, it seems like you could just put a TLS public key directly in a domain record, and have browsers read that. I&#x27;m confident there are good reasons this won&#x27;t work, and I can even guess at a few, but I&#x27;m looking for good resources that explain the ins and outs of the security implications here.",
