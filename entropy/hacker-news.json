Or if the server&#x27;s bandwidth is slow, people from other country will have hard time reading&#x2F;changing the note. or if the server&#x27;s network is banned in certain countries like north korea&#x2F;china people from that country cannot read thenote<p>as the note is stored in a smart contract on the blockchain, no one can change it for 1 hour and anyone on earth can read&#x2F;change it without any third party interference.<p>I&#x27;d love any feedback you have and if you think of anything it doesn&#x27;t have that it should, I&#x27;d love to hear that too.",

      "text": "I get a lot of bot traffic to various potentially sensitive endpoints on my blog. Stuff like Wordpress admin or other endpoints that could allow a site to be compromised if they existed. It&#x27;s really common so that part doesn&#x27;t surprise me, but I noticed I get quite a bit of this traffic with &quot;binance.com&quot; listed as the referrer and got curious.<p>My first thought was that someone is spoofing the referrer. I don&#x27;t know much about crypto exchanges, but it seems like Binance is a pretty &quot;legit&quot; one, which is what made me think they&#x27;re not sending this traffic (plus, who would do this and leave their actual referrer exposed?). I thought maybe it&#x27;s a homoglyph phishing attempt, but it seems to just be the legit binance domain string.<p>I&#x27;m curious anyone would choose to spoof this domain specifically? Most of these bots report no referrer, a few report google or bing. What may be the motivation for using the binance domain?",
