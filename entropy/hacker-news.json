I can rather build something on my own using a React Native app with a spare iPhone that I have but I rather get some recommendations of some (at least) secure baby monitors.<p>Saw some recommendations on reddit but seems like baby monitors manufacturers are not so privacy oriented.<p>Any advice&#x2F;recommendations?<p>Thank youuu! :)",
