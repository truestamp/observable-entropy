      "text": "Hey HN!<p>I built unitunes to take control of my music. unitunes is a CLI tool that can transfer songs between services and keep playlists in sync. It is a free open source alternative to paid services such as Soundiiz and TuneMyMusic.<p>unitunes stores your playlists in plain text, allowing you to version control your music. Playlists can be pushed and pulled from streaming services. Tracks from one service can be searched on another.<p>Currently spotify, musicbrainz, and youtube music are supported. I hope to add support for all kinds of &quot;services&quot;, such as local files, musescore, osu!, beatsaber, genius, or anywhere else music exists in some form.<p>I&#x27;m looking for collaborators to help add more services and improve the search algorithm!<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;platers&#x2F;unitunes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;platers&#x2F;unitunes</a>",
