      "text": "Problem: GIven a frame from a mobile camera&#x27;s video stream, I need to pick a reference image (from a corpus of images) that the given frame most closely resembles.  Input: Mobile frame, Output: file name of reference image.<p>I can constrain the problem further. I can make sure that the mobile camera is positioned at about the same angle that the reference images were taken; but the mobile used to capture the reference may not be the same as the one &#x27;in the field&#x27;; given the differences in resolution, lighting, different types of mobile camera specs etc, the images are bound to differ.<p>Second, it is possible that some part of the image to be identified is occluded (like a hand or a paper weight).<p>This needs to work on Android (which I am new to), and I don&#x27;t have much of a background in image recognition. Ideally, if there is a way to fingerprint&#x2F;hash the image in a way that is resistant to occlusion, rotation etc, and perhaps even the angle it is viewed from, that would be nice.  I have thought of using Unity+Vuforia or OpenCV, but if there is a simpler way, please let me know. Thank y&#x27;all so much.",
