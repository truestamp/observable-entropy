From an initial look, these applications seem little better than malware. After reviewing their various terms of service, it seems like there is no way to have your data removed from the system, etc.<p>My school is forcing the install of this application on machines that the kids will be using. Beyond the various security&#x2F;privacy concerns of these applications (what data they will capture, how it&#x27;ll be stored, how it&#x27;ll be used) I&#x27;m also conscious of the social aspect of teaching the kids that they will always be monitored (or at least setting the expectation).",
