But each time I pick up a book I think I can probably do a little bit of work or practice some interviewing skills like leetcode rather than reading which is not going to give any benefit. Secondly, books are overly verbose so I tend to read 10 min summaries which obviously don&#x27;t convey the material as nicely as the real book. Anyone find this familiar? How do you commit yourself to a healthy reading habit? (I prefer physical books than another digital device like Kindle).",
