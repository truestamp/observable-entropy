      "text": "I realized today that I really enjoy learning new programming languages. something about the unexplored useful tools you&#x27;re about to find. Almost like starting a new character in a video game, a world of possibilities and spells and swords ahead.<p>I also realized why I haven&#x27;t been doing this as much as I&#x27;d like... because I saw it as doing &quot;free work&quot; for my employer. To an extent I was right. I&#x27;m put on tons of new projects&#x2F;languages&#x2F;frameworks at work, it seems like more than others... I think because I express interest in them, and am at least willing to take a shot at it, even if it&#x27;s difficult or new. After awhile I resented all the time I needed to put in to keep up with it. It wasn&#x27;t fair. That made me feel that I shouldn&#x27;t put in more time, even if I want to.<p>How do you think about self-study? Do you just try to manage your work life the best you can and follow your interests wherever they lead (weather or not it overlaps with work)? Do you have strategies or suggestions around this kind of thing?",
