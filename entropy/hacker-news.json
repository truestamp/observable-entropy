      "text": "Hi HN,<p>Should I upgrade my development and business workstation from Windows 10 to Linux (instead of upgrading to Windows 11)?<p>I&#x27;m extremely intimidated in taking the leap.  I&#x27;m very familiar with Linux without a UI, and feel very comfortable with managing linux servers.  I setup and run a cluster of RHEL servers for a private-cloud OpenStack deployment (kvm hypervisor).  Familiar with apache web servers, and I run my own Asterisk PBX phone system, and have in the past done my own email server.  Networking, iptables, etc.<p>But I&#x27;ve never used Linux in a desktop UI environment.  Ever.  Always been an MS Windows guy.  But Windows 11?<p>I think my biggest fear are driver issues and having to convert a ton of files over to new formats for things I use to run my business.  (Lots of MS Excel files for example).  I use Microsoft Office (Word, Outlook, Excel) and Microsoft Visual Studio (F# Development) heavily.  Excel is my biggest worry.  And fighting with driver issues.<p>I&#x27;m familiar mostly with RHEL (CentOS, and I guess now &quot;Rocky Linux&quot;).<p>Anyone here convert from Windows to Linux?  What kind of issues did you run into?  Should I do it?<p>Perhaps most importantly:  Which Linux distro should I choose, and which desktop environment?<p>-AMD Ryzen Threadripper 2950X 16-Core 3.50 GHz<p>-Aorus X399 XTreme EATX TR4<p>-128GB RAM<p>-NVIDEO GeForce RTX 2080 (Gigabyte)<p>-(Two) 1TB NVMe Samsung SSD 970",
