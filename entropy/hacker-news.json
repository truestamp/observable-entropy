      "text": "About me: I&#x27;m already proficient in C, C++, Javascript, and Scala.  I&#x27;m expertly adept at Java, Go, and Bash.<p>I am sold on the idea of Rust, it&#x27;s awesome.  With that said, I&#x27;ve played around with Rust and love it conceptually and philosophically.  But whenever I go to learn it or actually start hacking on it, I&#x27;m put off and frustrated by the steep learning curve in terms of being able to read and understand Rust programs.  The syntax is relatively complex compared to the other languages I know.  I consistently end up overwhelmed and give up in frustration.  This is just for fun, there isn&#x27;t a professional driver pushing me to learn it every day.<p>I&#x27;m hoping for something better than &quot;just push through it over and over until it becomes familiar&quot;.  Learning Go was a pleasure back in 2012, and I wish learning Rust felt similarly empowering.<p>What is the most efficient path to gaining proficiency in Rust?",
