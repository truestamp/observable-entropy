      "text": "Like many others during the pandemic I began speculating on various cryptocurrencies in the past year. I had some modest success earlier in the year but the past few months of have been a whirlwind thanks to a lucky trade where I was able to turn a $5000 NFT purchase into $1.5mm. I have also had good success running various bots to profit from arbitrage opportunities across various blockchains and exchanges, and after scaling up the volume of this activity have made around $500,000 from this in the last half of the year.<p>I am a software developer in a mid-size, medium cost of living city in the US making ~$150k&#x2F;yr with around 6 years of experience. I&#x27;m in my early thirties and recently got engaged to be married in the next year. I own my home outright, have saved 20-30% of my income for my entire career but do have ~$100,000 student loan debt between myself and my future husband. Since I live in a high tax state I can expect to take home maybe a bit over $1mm after taxes, with a net worth of around $1.3-1.8mm at that point. Most of the money I&#x27;ve made in crypto last year is held in stable coins (USDC, DAI, USDT etc.) but I also hold low six figures of ETH and various other tokens. I&#x27;ve pulled out around $200k to my traditional bank account.<p>I&#x27;ve been making an effort to not change my lifestyle despite this new wealth, aside from updating my personal office, computer etc. since I will be able to take those expenses as tax deductions. At this point I feel like I am almost losing money by keeping my day job, since I haven&#x27;t been able to optimize my bots&#x2F;capitalize on opportunities that I would have otherwise. On the other hand, I have no idea how long I will be able to continue to make money from my bots as it continues to become more competitive. I&#x27;m working to find tax and legal professionals but I&#x27;m not sure where to start really and it&#x27;s hard to find someone who will work with me given the nature of my income. My current job has begun to feel like a bit of a dead end, and I get along fine with my co-workers but don&#x27;t feel a strong connection to anyone. On the other hand my current job is very flexible and I can do many of my responsibilities on &quot;autopilot&quot; giving me the bandwidth to to pursue my side projects while holding down my day job. At this point it feels like my options are:<p>- stay at current job but reduce hours\n- find a new job, maybe in crypto\n- quit job and go full time into crypto<p>Is there anything I&#x27;m not thinking of or advice that folks who have been at a similar crossroads can impart? Thanks in advance, I apologize for the length of this post and I hope I distilled all the relevant details here.",
