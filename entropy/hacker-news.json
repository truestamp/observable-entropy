      "text": "Like many others here, I have a LinkedIn account. Recruiters at my company want to join my network to generate leads. If I thought someone was a good choice to bring in, I’d refer them myself and get the employee referral spiff. By opening it up to someone else, I’m giving up that spiff for free.<p>This is a very tangible case in which personal data has clear monetary worth.<p>Has anyone thought up a model where my economic incentives and my employer’s are more aligned? If I have equity, the impact of successful hires on that equity needs to be pretty large to equal the referral spiff.<p>Of course there is the possibility of unintended or detrimental side effects from the economic results. E.g “bonus” for access could really be “docking” for employees that don’t share.",
