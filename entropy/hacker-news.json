We have a few data backends (including SQL and Spark), and I&#x27;m looking for an easy way to write reports that get surfaced up to our end users, but with all the niceties like PDF generation, good printing support, templates, etc. I know Tableau and Looker have white label solutions, but they&#x27;re pretty expensive - any good recommendations for a smaller startup?",

      "text": "One of my best friends is a retired US army Captain (commissioned),combat veteran,ranger,Spec Ops. He has masters in political science and has experience commanding 100+ men in combat. Has extensive experience working as military attache. Currently, he works as a manager for an event company and he is the best manager they have, but there is zero career growth. I would like him to get into IT management, but I have no idea how to help get into this field, given his background and zero experience in IT (he know how to use computer). On top of that, he has music degree and has excellent writing skills. Knows German, English, Russian and understands Spanish very well. In the past, he had top secret security clearance. \nThank you !",
