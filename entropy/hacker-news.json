      "text": "I&#x27;ve found a vulnerability in the authentication protocol of a domestic solar inverter. Essentially it allows anyone having access to local network to change any parameters and disrupt the system operation, damage it or, possibly, even cause a fire. Considering that in most cases people use potentially insecure WPA2 networks it may be kind of an issue...<p>The manufacturer told me that they don&#x27;t care.<p>At one hand it may be convenient for end users because the manufacturer refuses to provide them any administrative access to the devices.<p>At the other hand I kinda feel that it&#x27;s not a good idea to let these devices to run as they are.<p>Any advice?",
