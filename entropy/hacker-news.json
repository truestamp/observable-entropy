      "text": "A Cyber Deck is a creative computer design.<p>Cyber Decks come in all shapes and sizes.<p>Cyber Decks are unusual and interesting and futuristic, or retro, or cyberpunk or steampunk.<p>People obviously love Cyber Decks.<p>Here&#x27;s some examples of Cyber Decks:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=%22cyber+deck%22+computer<p>There&#x27;s a Reddit devoted to Cyber Decks:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;cyberDeck&#x2F;<p>There&#x27;s videos of Cyber Decks:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;results?search_query=cyber+deck+computer<p>BUT..... you can&#x27;t buy anything like a cyber deck.  Search Amazon, eBay, Google Shopping - nothing.<p>All hardware manufacturers make is the same old rectangular boxes.  There&#x27;s a very small number of unusual shapes, including one pyramid.  But for the most part even these &quot;unusually shaped&quot; cases are basically the same old design, pretty much a box with a motherboard in it, with unusual angles on the box.<p>Why is there so little innovation in computer design when the hobbyists are clearly showing what people like and are interested in?",
