      "text": "Ive been working on a Neovim plugin that fixes my current frustrations with code reviews in the GitHub web UI.<p>Its called &quot;gh.nvim&quot; and is a full featured GitHub integration for performing code reviews in Neovim. \nIt takes a &quot;commit-wise&quot; approaching, which is useful in most professional OSS projects where commits are the defining structure of the pull request.<p>Theres a good amount of initial features outlined in the demonstration video.<p>Gh.nvim is very new, and probably has a fair amount of bugs still, however I use it daily at this point. Could use some testers to find bugs&#x2F;report issues&#x2F;contribute fixes etc.<p>Code is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ldelossa&#x2F;gh.nvim<p>Demo is here: \nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;hhrWwYfMK1I",
