      "text": "We all love to drink coffee, right? Of course, but you want to delay your first caffeine intake to 90 to 120 minutes after you wake up. This is because adenosine, one of the factors that induce a sense of sleepiness in your system, is likely to be very low in the morning. If you do drink caffeine earlier, you will block adenosine from acting on the aficionados receptor. This will help you feel very alerted first, but it will also cause an afternoon crash from caffeine.<p>One of the best ways to ensure a caffeine crash is to drink a bunch of caffeine early. It blocks all those adenosine receptors. Then, by early or late afternoon, when that caffeine starts to wear off and gets dislodged from the receptors, previously stopped adenosine creates a greater level of sleepiness. Then you will need another cup of caffeine which will cause problems with the sleep quality later today.<p>What you want to do is to let your cortisol naturally come up in the morning and avoid drinking caffeine until about 90 minutes or two hours after waking. Delaying caffeine intake optimises the relationship between adenosine and wakefulness and sleepiness in a positive way that provides a friendly, consistent arc of energy throughout the day and brings the energy down as you are headed toward sleep and falling asleep.<p>Sign up for the closed beta launch. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prdikt.co",
