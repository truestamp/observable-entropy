They spend a lot of time and energy working on the system and expanding it and given that they are a publicly traded company it isn&#x27;t just because they heart Open Source so darned much.<p>I think that the recent efforts to make Visual Studio Code run in a browser are the first steps in MS making a modern &#x27;Java&#x27; that not only allows you to build Mac, Windows and Linux apps but also web apps that look and act like desktop apps.<p>MS has Typescript and via Github it has Electron. So it has a language and a &#x27;platform&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t control Node or Chromium though so the entire delivery chain isn&#x27;t under their control but it looks as if they are working on a system that will let them promise &#x27;write once&#x27; by removing the underlying OS.<p>What does everyone else think? Likely?",
