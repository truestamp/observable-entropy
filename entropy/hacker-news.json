      "text": "A while back there was an HN discussion[1] in which I asked whether there&#x27;s a consensus that it makes sense to use a VPN while traveling and using public wi-fi in places like airports. The answer I received was pretty consistently that there&#x27;s no point.<p>But the NSA has released a document that says: &quot;Accessing public Wi-Fi hotspots may be convenient to catch up on work or check email, but public Wi-Fi is often not configured securely. Using these networks may make usersâ€™ data and devices more vulnerable to compromise, as cyber actors employ malicious access points (Masquerading [T1036]1), redirect to malicious websites, inject malicious proxies, and eavesdrop on network traffic (Network Sniffing [T1040]).&quot;[2]<p>So, I&#x27;m still unsure about it. For instance, suppose I accidentally use a malicious public wi-fi service masquerading as the one supplied by an airport. I try to go to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.somewebsite.com. Would the malicious wi-fi service be able to supply a phishing version of www.somewebsite.com that also uses https? If not, why not?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28643650#28643995\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.defense.gov&#x2F;2021&#x2F;Jul&#x2F;29&#x2F;2002815141&#x2F;-1&#x2F;-1&#x2F;0&#x2F;CSI_SECURING_WIRELESS_DEVICES_IN_PUBLIC.PDF",
