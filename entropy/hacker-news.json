      "text": "I just wanted to thank HNews and provide anecdotal experience of something shared that has been working for me.<p>&gt; Jul 6, Breathing exercise lowers blood pressure better than working out, medication - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27747943<p>I have High Blood Pressure (HBP), ~140-145&#x2F;90-95 non-medicated, ~130&#x2F;85-90 on 40mg Amlodipine.<p>I&#x27;ve had HBP for about 12 years now. Up until this article, my strongest levers were controlling salt and alcohol intake. I regularly exercised at one point in the past 12 years as part of a fitness company and that didn&#x27;t really move my medicated needle.<p>Per the article&#x27;s recommendation I went and bought an IMT device on AliExpress (happy to share which one, but I don&#x27;t want to plug a specific device).<p>I&#x27;ve been using the IMT device for 10 days (first 3 days using to ramp up) and I use an Omron HEM-7280T for BP monitoring. This is the first time it&#x27;s gone so low on a trailing 7 day average, ~110-115&#x2F;80-85 on 40mg Amlodipine.<p>In the past, I&#x27;ve tried so many other things, Beet root, juices, running, but while healthier in general it hardly affected my BP.<p>I 100% can believe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been a weak breather in general and this was tackling a core problem my body has. Taking deep belly breathing is much easier now (a key to relaxation?). I usually breath with my chest, even for deep breaths, but now I can do it with my belly. To be fair, that&#x27;s literally the point of IMT. Be specific, I fit the target group the study (in the Jul 6 article) was aiming for - HBP and relatively low exercise.<p>With that, I can&#x27;t say IMT for everyone with HBP, but I do believe it&#x27;s worth spending $30 to see if it does anything since it&#x27;s non-drug, non-invasive.<p>This is not medical advice. Just saying it worked for me. Please talk to your doctor!<p>If these results stick for 30 days, I&#x27;ll speak to my doctor about lowering my Amlodipine dosage. First time ever in 12 years.<p>Thanks HN, Justin",
