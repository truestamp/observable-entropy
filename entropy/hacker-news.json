Conversely there are a lot of people who are writing if off due to the scams and bubbles in the space.<p>I am interested actual use cases for cryptocurrency based technology where it adds real value. I am aware of some for eg. censorship resistance, hyper inflation due to increasing money supply etc.<p>Appreciate any input. Thanks.",
