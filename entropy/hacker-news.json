      "text": "A pal asked me to do a modest amount of contract software work over the next few months. They of course want to pay me on a 1099. But I want to minimize the hassle of that. Paperwork is not my forte. What solutions do folks here use and like?<p>Previously I&#x27;ve outsourced the problem to vendors. Most recently it was MyBizOffice, which later rebranded as MBO Partners. They&#x27;d receive the 1099 income, take a 4% cut, and then let me pay it out to myself on a W2, optionally buying benefits along the way. They&#x27;re now apparently out of that business, or I&#x27;d still be using them.<p>If I have to, I&#x27;m also willing to set up my own entity. But if I do, I want a minimum-labor way to do that such that I don&#x27;t end up in trouble with the IRS for failing to file something or other.<p>Those are my needs, but if yours differ, please post them in the comments, as I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of niche needs and solutions.",
