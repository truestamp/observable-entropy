      "text": "Something I&#x27;ve noticed, a lot later than most of you I&#x27;m sure, is the death of audio outputs on most hardware: laptops, PCs, media streamers. Years ago I bought a Shuttle PC barebones kit that just required CPU, RAM and a hard disk. The tiny motherboard had integrated  sound with 6 channels output (3 x 3.5mm jacks) and optical (spdif&#x2F;toslink). My old 2015 Macbook Pro even had optical output built into the 3.5mm headphone jack. Practically every computer I owned for over a decade provided at least one way to get surround sound: separate amps, a 5.1 PC speaker setup , an AV receiver...  Something for every budget!<p>All of the newer surround sound formats that emerged from Dolby are HDMI-only because it&#x27;s got built in content protection. This brings a bunch of problems. Do you have the right version of HDMI cable? Will you AV receiver play music when the 200watt TV is switched off?  &quot;Maybe&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m perfectly happy with 5.1 sound. I&#x27;m not going to wire up  two more speakers for Dolby Atmos. So why should I upgrade my receiver? And if I don&#x27;t, what other options so I have in 2021?<p>Answer: Not many.",
