      "text": "Hey HN! For Hacktoberfest this year, we wanted to do something that was geared towards the ML community, and we decided to create an open-source catalog of  audio datasets.<p>The response has been truly amazing! We received 40 dataset contributions, which are now publicly available, and viewable on DagsHub. They cover various tasks, languages, and sizes, and you can use them all for your projects.<p>If you want to check out the list of datasets: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dagshub.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;hacktoberfest-2021-open-source-audio-datasets&#x2F;. I can&#x27;t wait to see what everyone builds with these.<p>A huge THANK YOU to everyone who participated! You are what made this possible! The fact that Hacktoberfest is over doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t continue contributing. We&#x27;d love to see more datasets, both in the audio domain and others.",
