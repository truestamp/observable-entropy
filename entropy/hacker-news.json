      "text": "Angularis is a game similar to Tetris, but based on triangles instead of squares. Which is why it also has diagonal movements.

You kind of have to get used to &quot;think diagonally&quot;.<p>Maybe it can be a nice little challenge for you.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to receive some feedback. Thanks!",
