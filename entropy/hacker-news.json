      "text": "I currently work as a software dev. I am on a 2 week break.<p>I am going to a remote hilly area, reason because I want to be away from my home, city for a while, to &quot;reset&quot; and dont wanna look at my screen.<p>Some advices I got as to what to do:\n1. Don&#x27;t do anything tech. Don&#x27;t code (for fun), or read tech (blogs, etc.)\n2. Also dont seclude yourself in your remote home, just get out. (i love exploring anyway, so I&#x27;ll be out)<p>I&#x27;m not planning to read any (tech or non-tech) books but personally I&#x27;d love to read Data Intensive book.<p>So during this time, what do you suggest I do? I can&#x27;t reveal my location, so you don&#x27;t have to suggest any location-specific advices, just any general ones you feel like.<p>How would you or how did you spend a break like this? What should I (or not) do?<p>Thanks for your time :)",
