The book goes through following topics based on the comments of these &quot;microfounders&quot;:<p>1) How to come up with a <i>good</i> idea?\n2) How to find your first customers?\n3) How to continue finding customers later?\n4) What&#x27;s their advice in general for devs wanting to build a profitable solo internet startup?<p>I&#x27;ve been talking to many many founders like these and I&#x27;d be happy to give my perspective on any questions you may have.",
