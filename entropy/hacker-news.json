      "text": "Roughly once a week, HN will feature a link to a new web-based UI framework&#x2F;toolkit. These seem to build upon a history that, briefly stated, seems to go: HTML -&gt; HTML5 -&gt; JS -&gt; Node -&gt; React -&gt; [ a lot of stuff ]. Obviously there are things that branched off at various points along the way.<p>As a purely native desktop application developer, whenever I read about these frameworks, they seem to contain almost no trace of any of the programming models&#x2F;designs&#x2F;lessons that were learned between (say) 1980 and 2005 in the domain of native GUI toolkits (both platform-specific and cross-platform). There&#x27;s almost no trace of any of the vocabulary, but also very little sign of any of the fundamental concepts (widgets, &quot;classic&quot; MVC, etc.)<p>So I&#x27;m asking without (much) predjudice: what&#x27;s so different about UI&#x2F;UX in web-dev that justifies throwing away all these design lessons? Or are they really still in modern web frameworks and I&#x27;m just not seeing them?",
