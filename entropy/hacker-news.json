      "text": "Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m putting together a structure for an MVP, the guts of which should be pretty straightforward(and just using a Flask&#x2F;React stack). But we&#x27;re very likely going to target some large enterprises as initial customers. We had a call with our advisors last night, who urged us heavily to use Spring from the start, and that it&#x27;s important to get the architecture &quot;right&quot; from the start.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking around the internet, and I&#x27;m curious if there are any references I could use to ground myself in terms of what they&#x27;ll require, what the interaction is like, what we should have ready before even showing something to them.<p>Our advisors mentioned that they tend to dig into the architecture, wanted portability for datastores (this was confusing, they mentioned wanting to swap postgres for spanner, for example), understand uptime, security, and so on.  Is there some literature&#x2F;blog post somewhere that I could reference?",
