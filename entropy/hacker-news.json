      "text": "I tried switching from jetbrains to various modal editors (neovim, doom-emacs, kakoune, helix).\nThe fast startup time and continuity when working in a terminal environment was very appealing,\nas was the promise of increased code editing effeciency.<p>I liked the fast startup time and having the same keybindings to edit system config files but\nI am not impressed with VIM style text editing. First of all programmers don&#x27;t really edit text,\nwe edit code. VIM&#x27;s grammar does not acknowledge this. It is centered around lines, words etc.\nCode is a tree. IMO, you want to keybinds which traverse the tree, expand&#x2F;shrink selections etc.<p>Of course I can install tree-sitter and setup structual editing based bindings but am I really\nusing VIM at this point? In summary, I don&#x27;t think the VIM grammar is the future of code editing.\nI think it is a bit overrated. I think editor designers should work on developing a grammar&#x2F;keybinds\nthat center around structural&#x2F;tree based editing.<p>I think this concept could even be applied to source control ie. git stores an tree-sitter like\nrepresentation of code instead of text. Your text editor handles formatting.",
