They then called the movement &quot;No More Blacks&quot; and had giant posters&#x2F;banners&#x2F;articles &quot;No Blacks&quot; &quot;No More Blacks&quot; and came out with recommended css file called &quot;noblk.css&quot;<p>Sure, the intent itself has is not racists but the result seems less clear. Everytime I see &quot;No Tofu&quot; it sounds like a diss against my entire culture than just a declaration of &quot;no more undererable characters&quot;.<p>Lots of non-asians dislike tofu so of course they&#x27;d declare &quot;no more tofu&quot; is the prefect ralying cry, tofu is gross. Which is a fine opinion, I don&#x27;t like every food ihe world&quot; but it&#x27;s less okay to me to have that feeling embedded in &quot;Noto&quot; Fonts and a movement that posts articles &quot;No More Tofu&quot;.",
