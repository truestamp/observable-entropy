I feel like if I say anything to anyone else it might jeopardize my candidacy.<p>Ever since I was passed off to a second recruiter for the onsite interviews things have been a nightmare. I passed the interviews and moved on to team selection but the process has now been dragging on for over a month and a half. For instance I had matched with a team but the recruiter took so long to reach out to the legal team about immigration that the team moved forward with another candidate. The recruiter is now taking days to reply to emails and has taken weeks to get feedback from other teams I&#x27;ve had intro calls with.<p>I&#x27;d love to work for this company but this is past the point of absurdity. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I&#x27;ve considered sending an email to the initial recruiter asking if he can take a look at what is going on.",
