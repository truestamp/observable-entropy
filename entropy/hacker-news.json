She sees math in everything she does. She tries to hide this from her friends, because she thinks it&#x27;s too geeky. Missy hears that the school math club needs more members, but she&#x27;s worried about what her friends will think if she joins, and she&#x27;s already committed to joining the fashion club.&quot;<p>The book is about &quot;Gain an inside perspective on what it&#x27;s like when you love math and science and happen to be a girl.&quot;<p>Is this true?
