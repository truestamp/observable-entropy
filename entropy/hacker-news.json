      "text": "Hi Everybody,<p>I made 4 mindmaps using the key takeaways from the book “The Epic Guide to Agile: More Business Value on a Predictable Schedule with Scrum”, and would love to share them with all of you.<p>Some of you may have read this book or heard about it. It was published in 2019 and it’s a modern guide on how to use Agile, specifically Scrum, in the most effective way. After reading this book I loved it so much that I decided to make a mindmap to help myself understand and internalize the key information better. There are 4 parts and 30 chapters in the book and the author Dave Todaro provided some key takeaways at the end of each chapter. I ended up making a huge mindmap with all that information so I broke it down into 4 smaller mindmaps, each containing the key takeaways from one part of the book.<p>Here is the book’s Table of Contents (my mindmaps are structured in the same way):<p>Part 1 (Mindmap 1): Understanding Scrum Fundamentals<p>Chapter 1 - Introduction to High-Performance Teamwork\nChapter 2 - Scrum&#x27;s 10 Guideposts\nChapter 3 - The Product Backlog\nChapter 4 - User Stories\nChapter 5 - The Sprint\nChapter 6 - Scrum Ceremonies\nChapter 7 - Scrum Roles\nChapter 8 - The Sprint Backlog\nChapter 9 - The Product<p>Part 2 (Mindmap 2): Understanding Agile Software Construction<p>Chapter 10 - Introduction to Agile Software Construction\nChapter 11 - Creating a Shippable Increment Requires Team Test Environment\nChapter 12 - Managing Source Code Properly Avoids Pain When &quot;Life Happens&quot;\nChapter 13 - Automated Unit Testing: The Foundation of Code Quality\nChapter 14 - Acceptance Testing: Making Sure Everything Works Together\nChapter 15 - Agile Architecture and Technical Design<p>Part 3 (Mindmap 3): Laying the Groundwork<p>Chapter 16 - Here Be Dragons: Preparing for the Challenges You&#x27;ll Face\nChapter 17 - Forming Your Pilot Scrum Team\nChapter 18 - Your Team&#x27;s Path to Excellence\nChapter 19 - Creating the Initial Product Backlog\nChapter 20 - Estimating the Size of the Product Backlog\nChapter 21 - Creating an Initial Schedule Projection\nChapter 22 - Splitting User Stories for Increased Momentum\nChapter 23 - Final Preparations Before Your First Sprint<p>Part 4 (Mindmap 4): Building the Product<p>Chapter 24 - Determining Sprint Logistics\nChapter 25 - Planning the Sprint\nChapter 26 - Orchestrating the Daily Work of the Sprint\nChapter 27 - A &quot;Zero-Defects&quot; Approach to Dealing with Bugs\nChapter 28 - Providing Transparency and Getting Feedback with the Sprint Review\nChapter 29 - Driving Continuous Improvement with the Sprint Retrospective\nChapter 30 - Confidently Releasing Your Product into Production<p>In this Dropbox folder you will find the 4 mindmaps (in PNG image format).<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dropbox.com&#x2F;sh&#x2F;jxzxbnb0em8h1x5&#x2F;AAC-2U2D-bLBnqIv42gx9ztra?dl=0<p>I also included in the folder the original XMind files that I created (XMind is a desktop and mobile app for mind mapping). This way you will be able to edit the 4 mindmaps to suit your own learning. To be able to do that, I included the XMind desktop app installers for both macOS and Windows in the Dropbox folder as well.<p>I can honestly say that these mindmaps (and the process of making them) helped me tremendously in absorbing the key information from the book, and it is my hope that you will get some value from them too.<p>Finally, if anyone is hiring, I&#x27;m currently seeking a remote Scrum Master, QA Tester or Customer Support Representative job..<p>My LinkedIn profile is at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;qing-wang-sync&#x2F;<p>Thank you so much everyone for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this and&#x2F;or check out my mindmaps, and please stay safe and healthy during these challenging times..<p>Gratefully yours,\nQing",
