Should my YAML tag names, some of which are several word,  use mixed case for readability, or all lowercase, or what? Surprisingly, the standard (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yaml.org&#x2F;spec&#x2F;1.2.2&#x2F;) is silent on how to represent identifiers, although most of their examples are all lowercase.<p>One option is embedded caps with hyphens:<p><pre><code>    Exclude-Dirs:\n    - *.css\n    - *.go\n    - backup\n</code></pre>\nOr all lowercase, for consistency and ease of typing? It&#x27;s a bit harder to scan in a long listing.<p><pre><code>    exclude-dirs:\n    - *.css\n    - *.go\n    - backup\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m going to avoid the programmery compound words, like this, because I&#x27;m angling somewhat for the power user, as opposed to programmer, audience:<p><pre><code>    # Nope\n    excludedirs:\n    - *.css\n    - *.go\n    - backup</code></pre>",
