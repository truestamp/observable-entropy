      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m looking for advice on calculating the market value for my business.<p>At the beginning of this year, my partner and I decided to part ways and sell our business that started as a side project in October 2013. Over the years we received several offers but never seriously discussed this option. Unfortunately, last year the pandemic changed our priorities. I have to mention that we live in Eastern Europe.<p>Let me briefly describe our biz - it&#x27;s a SaaS project that has generated over $2.5 million to date. 99% of the revenue is subscription based – mainly B2B. Refunds under 1%. Everything was processed through PayPal from the beginning - same account.<p>The problem is, we never incorporated a company for this project. So everything was done in our name.<p>How can I figure out our market worth?<p>Thanks for your help!<p>Edit: I have no experience selling a business, that&#x27;s why I ask.",
