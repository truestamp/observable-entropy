      "text": "Hey, I am Merijn! I am currently making a project called Office Portal for my internship.\nI am currently doing the study software developer (2nd year). I am still a beginner in writing code so contributors are welcome on the GitHub page!<p>In these times of covid people usually work in separate rooms to prevent the spreading of the virus. When your colleagues are working in separate rooms the office can feel very lonely. So we came up with the idea “Office Portal” and make the project accessible for everyone on GitHub. Office Portal is inspired by the game Portal from Valve. With this project, we are creating 2 portals using a raspberry pi, television, and a camera module.\nthen hang both portals in 2 separate rooms and you will be able to see the other room “through” the portal. With this project, we hope to bring your colleagues a bit closer and make your office feel a bit less lonely.<p>I’ve written the instructions step by step so everyone even with little experience with a Raspberry pi can follow them.<p>All the instructions and necessary code to make this project are available on GitHub:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;merijndewit&#x2F;Office_Portal<p>All the instructions for making your own Office Portal are written there from hardware to software. For the software, I made a GUI to make everything a bit easier. This program will help you install all the necessary dependencies and help you setting up the stream. It also has a few extra features: use an led strip or digital portal mast to make it look more like a portal. \nFor the hardware I’ve written in detail what you need and where you need to look out for when buying parts, and how to install everything to make an awesome portal!\nI’ve tested the program a lot and I was able to stream at a resolution of 1080p with a delay of around 400ms while receiving a stream from another raspberry pi.<p>I’ve Had a lot of fun making this project. One of the biggest challenges was streaming the video of the camera and receiving the video from the other pi in decent quality and low delay due to hardware limitations. Luckily I’ve found a way to do it with omxplayer and GStreamer. \nIf you just want to stream video from one pi to another without using the python program (doing everything manually) then follow the instructions on this readme:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;merijndewit&#x2F;Office_Portal&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;Other.md<p>I want to say thank you to my internship supervisor: Rens \nAnd the company where I did my internship: Rapide<p>Thanks for reading!",
