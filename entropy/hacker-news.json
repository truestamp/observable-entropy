      "text": "What is the main motivation for creating autonomous vehicles? Take delivery drones for example, what problems do they trying to solve? If we look at it from money perspective -- delivery jobs are among lowest paying. And that&#x27;s the segment that all those autonomous drones&#x2F;trucks are trying to take now. So basically billions of dollars going into research to solve non-existing problem.<p>More concerning is what comes after adoption of this technology. And this adoption almost surely will come, either due to dumping strategies, some government restrictions(&quot;Roads are Not for People&quot; act) or, most likely, both. As a consequences, ability to find a job will loosen for majority of people. Of course, liberals(that will become only more popular, broken folk loves &quot;free money to all&quot; policies) will be happy to write all those people some money checks out of squeezing middle class pockets. Small businesses will not win either, since maintenance costs will be hardly much lower when summed up. The only winners -- are elites. Billionaire investors and bribed politicians.<p>Future looks gloomy to me. Any opposite opinions?",
