Do you actively select smaller companies when looking for a job or size does not matter to you?\n2. Do you find companies&#x27; size and funding information useful on a job board?\n3. I found that there are very few companies with size 251-500 employees. For those looking to work in smaller companies, do you find 250+ employee companies too big?\n4. Would you sign up for a weekly newsletter that send you the most recent jobs for selected categories?\n5. Would salary range be useful to you as a candidate?<p>---<p>Question to broader HN community, how would you go about gathering salary information for biotech companies without crowdsourcing from employees?<p>Thanks!",
