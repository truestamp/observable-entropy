      "text": "I keep needing a way to run long-running resource intensive tasks after one another. Normally, I&#x27;d write a script which loops over the items, but not knowing what needs to run (I pick files as I go through a folder), I knew it&#x27;s time I create something to scratch my own itch. So, I&#x27;ve created this utility to queue up commands.<p>It captures command, args, env and working directory and puts it in a queue, and runs it when it&#x27;s time. \nAt the same time, it spins up an RPC server to receive commands from other instances. If there&#x27;s no server available, it becomes a server itself and waits for commands or shuts itself down after idling for some time.<p>This is my first (published) Golang project, so guidance &amp; review would be appreciated.",
