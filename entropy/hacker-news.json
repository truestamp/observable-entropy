The mindshare of web3 today is dominated by cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFTs, metaverse ... but my focus is on challenging data monopolies and simplifying users fractured internet experience. To give an idea, here are some products I am currently tracking: anytype.io fission.codes inrupt.com login.xyz museapp.com textile.io brave.com&#x2F;themis&#x2F;<p>If you have any groups (discord, lobster, matrix...) or people that are engaged in this space please share them below. Also if there are other products I should track drop a share those as well.<p>Thank you, \n-Yonz",
