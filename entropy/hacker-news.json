      "text": "Hi All,<p>I recently changed jobs and joined company B for better pay, and learning&#x2F;growth opportunity. It was a good move for my career in my opinion.<p>My old employer, company A, recently reached out asking if I would be willing to consult for them. Basically when I left, all of the knowledge of a particular product was gone. We have not worked out a contract yet.<p>My concern is that when I joined company B, I signed a contract which included a clause stating that &quot;I will not engage in any business that is in competition with company B&quot;.<p>Since both companies are in the same industry, but not in the same technologies, I&#x27;m worried that if company B ever found out, they could terminate me or I could face legal action.<p>So my question is, should I ask my new manager if it is alright to consult for company A? Or should I not tell them and just continue forward with consulting?<p>Scenario 1: I don&#x27;t tell my new manager. Everything works fine in the end, I make some extra money and things move on.<p>Scenario 2: I don&#x27;t tell my new manager. Company B somehow finds out and terminates me or I face legal action.<p>Scenario 3: I tell my new manager and he is fine with it.<p>Scenario 4: I tell my new manager and he says no. And now doesn&#x27;t believe I am committed to this job. I dont think he will think that. I know others on the team have side hustles (I looked them up on LinkedIn).<p>I am in the US in software, but the industry is not software driven.<p>Thanks!",
