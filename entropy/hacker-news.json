      "text": "A woman slammed into me at an intersection last year and smashed my nose.  I&#x27;m getting ready for surgery to have it fixed and had to do pre-op testing: blood work, a chest X-ray, and EKG at Norton Hospital in Louisville.<p>They use Epic online software so I take a look at the test results and as part of these tests, someone coded that I have a chronic sinus infection.  I don&#x27;t.  There&#x27;s a link to request chart corrections, so I do that, describe the chart error with an online form, then get the response back that chart requests have to be done in writing, with some kind of proof that the correction is &quot;correct&quot; and some kind of official copy of my record.  WTF??<p>This is so broken.  Some clerk or computer systems sticks something in my permanent health record not even related to what I was doing and now I can either ignore it and have every doctor from now on have incorrect information about me, or I have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get it fixed.  What a joke.",
