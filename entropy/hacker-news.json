      "text": "Hi all.<p>It&#x27;s Monday and I&#x27;m feeling sad. A perfect combination to sit down and write a long-read with a question. You are probably reading &quot;New&quot; section of HN out of boredom, let me try to entertain you and ask some questions along the way.<p>---<p>Some background first.<p>I&#x27;ve been working as UI&#x2F;UX&#x2F;product designer since ~2000, and I taught myself everything I needed to develop a personal website - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vlad.studio - including html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js&#x2F;php&#x2F;mysql&#x2F;bash. Soon after, I started selling access to &quot;premium&quot; content of Vlad.studio (the definition of &quot;premium&quot; has changed multiple times, as well as business model - 4 different plans, then yearly subscription, etc - currently it&#x27;s simply one-time purchase).<p>In 2010s, I was &quot;freelancer&quot; (read - no &quot;real&quot; job) and there has been a couple of years when Vlad.studio accounts were my main source of income (2000-3000 USD&#x2F;month). Good old times! Then, one thing led to another, I got kind of depressed, then got swamped in a stressful job, then another one. Until maybe 2019, the website was almost abandoned.<p>Recently, with only some part-time projects, I&#x27;m feeling the need to breathe more life into the old friend of mine. Vlad.studio has always been special for me - a place to express myself, a place where I have no lack of positive feedback of my art. This is truly inspiring!<p>The profits, however, are less and less. Which leads me to my question:<p>---<p>Is it even possible to turn such personal hobby website into a stable business?<p>I&#x27;ve been reflecting about whan makes people send me real money. My main theory is - a user has been enjoying my art for quite some time, and at some point, they buy an account to show appreciation (similar to Patreon, Buymeacoffee, etc).<p>There is no real &quot;value&quot;, however. I&#x27;m not an app. I do not simplify your workflow or make you more productive on a daily basis.<p>---<p>Some ideas I am considering:<p>1) add more features. What features? I feel I already have plenty. You can send any picture as an e-card (almost not used), play a puzzle, set as facebook cover. I recently introduced a New Tab extension for Chrome, as another way to deliver my art to my users&#x27; screens. I use it myself and find it useful, but it&#x27;s not enough :-)<p>2) change business model (again). Bask to monthly&#x2F;yearly subscriptions? I&#x27;m not sure I can justify them. Unless I publish a picture a week, maybe.<p>3) start spending money on marketing. I have never spent a dollar on marketing before! Was it a mistake? Is it too late? Maybe. In 2010s, vlad.studio was #4-5 result on Google when you searched for &quot;desktop wallpapers&quot;. Those times are long gone.<p>---<p>Some stats if you&#x27;re curious: Vlad.studio receives ~1000 visitors daily, and the average income for 2021 is $360&#x2F;month.<p>P.S. Thanks for reading this. I guess I&#x27;m reaching out to HN community because that&#x27;s the one website I read daily, and I almost always skip the links and read the comments instead.",
