      "text": "My SME employer has been working on a deal with a client for the last year or so to host a long-term project. To prepare for this, they purchased 30 enterprise-grade servers (plus supporting equipment) and hired a small team of ops staff to maintain and manage this new infrastructure.<p>For the last few months the client has been dragging their heels and using the pandemic as an excuse to drive down the price on the project, but costs still would have been covered and they seemed pretty happy with the new price on offer. Work was started in good faith to help hit a specific deadline set by the client, and everyone was collaborating well.<p>Until earlier this week, when the client pulled out of the deal completely and has shut down their side of operations. So my employer is left with a bunch of hardware idling and is now looking to rent them out to other clients.<p>Now, there&#x27;s enough cash left from the initial investment which gives the business about 6-months of &quot;runway&quot;. So this got me thinking what cool things could be done with these servers to jump on the next bleeding-edge tech and start to recoup costs and eventually turn a profit.<p>In this situation, given 30 6-month-old enterprise servers, a small team (3), and 6 months, how would _you_ make best use of these resources to build a business?",
