      "text": "Hi!<p>I&#x27;m trying to launch a new product.<p>Translation management for small development teams is time consuming task, even minor changes mean developers have to stop working and merge translation files. This is a problem I see pop-up over and over again in all the companies I have worked.<p>There are already some solutions in the market, but I find them cumbersome and over-priced, they also don&#x27;t focus on actually solving the problem for small teams, but just selling you translation services.<p>I would like to turn this around and create a tool truly focused on enabling collaboration and easy editing of in-app translations.<p>I would love to hear back from you guys:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;farspeak.co<p>Many thanks!",
