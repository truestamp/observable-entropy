      "text": "I&#x27;ve seen some posts here about preparing for a nuclear attack, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m prepared mentally for war of any kind.<p>I grew up in the UK during the 90s so I&#x27;ve obviously had a very sheltered life. The two most difficult things I&#x27;ve ever gone through is losing a job and having my heart broken. If nuclear war happened, assuming I survived I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to cope with the real suffering that would follow. I&#x27;m also not sure how I&#x27;d cope if I was drafted into a more conventional war. The idea of being cold, dump, tried and hungry for weeks on end seems unbearable to me. I also have no idea how I&#x27;d cope without seeing my partner for what could be months not knowing if she&#x27;s safe, or even still alive.<p>I&#x27;m terrified that the world I was raised for will not be my future. I am scared and I&#x27;ve not been able to focus on anything else since this conflict started. I don&#x27;t know how to mentally prepare myself for what might come and I&#x27;m not the kind of person who can just switch off and distract themselves at times like this.<p>Is there anything I can do to better prepare myself mentally for what might come?",

Some of their regional offices seem to have shut down in the wake of the Ukraine invasion but there have been no news reports of censorship of the website itself, or that it&#x27;s offline.<p>Can anyone still access it? Do you guys know what their IP is? Been wondering if the DNS resolving has been messed with.",
