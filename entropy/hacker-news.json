      "text": "Riven began with a simple question between longtime friends Fatima (the dentist) and Jay (the wellness geek); why hasn’t anyone tried a different approach to achieve better oral care outcomes?<p>The majority of bacteria found in your mouth is actually good bacteria helping your gums and teeth stay healthy and strong. Instead of trying to get rid of all the bacteria, why not add more good bacteria already found in your mouth (just like the gut)? A seemingly simple concept, we couldn’t find any products in the market that worked with your oral ecosystem. So we built it.<p>We worked with microbiologists, formulators, scientists to create the best possible formula supported by science and backed by research to build a mouthwash using probiotics to help you achieve fresher breath and healthier gums.<p>Nontoxic and Vegan\n  Science-Backed &amp; Dentist Formulated\n  Plastic Free\n  Woman Founded \n Charitable Giving",
