      "text": "Hey everyone,<p>recently I have been thinking of how to manage risks (and improve my communication skills) when interviewing with foreign companies.<p>Is there anything you would recommend to do, improve or look out for?<p>Risks I see are changes in schedule due to country policies and cross-cultural communication, especially in a corporate setting, which can be challenging. Examples can be the target country closing due to corona on short notice, necessitating a new apartment locally or flight cancellations.<p>------<p>Long story motivating this question, as this is born from my frustration around my own naivety:<p>I wanted to move abroad for (at least) some years for quite some time, and last summer when finishing up my PhD I started interviewing all around the world. I got an offer from a company in Tokyo via relocate.me which was good enough for me at the time. The recruiter was upfront: Due to the pandemic, I should not cancel my job or lease, as the process would take quite some time and that last time it took them ~6 months.<p>After getting the necessary documents and certificate of eligibility and a lot of back and forth with new required documents by japan&#x27;s government, I got somewhat lucky: In November the country opened up. The company instructed me to find a flight and book it for January. So I did. I also cancelled my lease as there is a 3 month cancellation period - although I didn&#x27;t communicate this with the company at the time and I did not book travel insurance for flight cancellations, only a flight that can be changed to another day.<p>Unfortunately, omicron hit right after this and japan closed down, the communication from the company seemed to slow down and become more one-sided, but finally, I got the info that there was nothing going to change before the end of January - no new date for the flight in sight.<p>As I didn&#x27;t want to end up homeless and reduce further losses from missed wages and flight tickets I decided to find a different job and a new apartment, cancel on the company and ask if they&#x27;d be willing to refund the ticket anyways. They told me they would look into it and I got in contact with a representative of the company. After some back and forth they stopped responding to me and I asked the recruiter if anything went wrong communication-wise. I was told the representative (who also received and responded to my cancellation email earlier) thought I got a different job and therefore stopped responding and that the managers decided the company was not responsible for my lost 1k$ of the flight, but they&#x27;ll look over it again.",
