      "text": "Hello HackerNews!<p>I started my SWE career in 2016. I&#x27;m in a team which develops an enterprise SaaS-Application. Now I got the opportunity to transform into a leader role which focuses on DevOps, Tests, QA, Documentation and related topics.<p>So far, we set goals and start to introduce the team (around 5 people) into that topic.<p>My question is - are there any good books, articles, podcasts, ... which can help me in this &quot;challenge&quot;? I already got some basic (practical) knowledge in leading people and managing a product.<p>Stay safe!",
