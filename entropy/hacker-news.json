      "text": "Looking for someone who can escalate a query through Stripe (I know a lof of of Stripe are reading here including pc).<p>We process about 5-10M a month through Stripe since 2018 without issues. On the 27th of December they have given us 48 hours notice, whilst the entire company is being ran on a skeleton support crew to completely get off stripe and switch to another processor.<p>We&#x27;ve been in touch with them recently and this was never brought up. We&#x27;ve already started the process to switch do an actual acquiring bank rather than a PSP like Stripe but there&#x27;s no way this can be completed now in 48 hours, IN BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NY.<p>This seems to be in line with the race to the bottom support from Stripe but pulling something like this is a new low.<p>So hoping that someone here can escalate.",
