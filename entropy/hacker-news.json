      "text": "Could be anything - dev tools, blogging platforms, SaaS...\nMine would be some (hypothetical) way of making it so I could see what accounts I had with any given service (Trello, GitHub, etc), what signin methods they used (password, social, etc), and could merge&#x2F;rename&#x2F;delete accounts and signin methods without going through tedious confirmation processes or support tickets. Something about having a fragile web of interconnected user&#x2F;password combos and email accounts makes me anxious whenever I think about it or create a new account somewhere. Almost every service I&#x27;ve used seems to make big assumptions behind the scenes about what to do when someone invites you to a team using email, for example, and you already have an account using GitHub signin - so you end up having either two different accounts or merged accounts when you don&#x27;t want to.",
