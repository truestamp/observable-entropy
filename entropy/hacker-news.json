Search now actively drives you to Apple Music subscription, old playlists won&#x27;t sync to my phone, my library that used to be a carefully maintained list of songs I love has become a mess with incorrect album art, album names and collections.<p>Is there something that gives us what iTunes was 8-9 years ago that I can export my data and go to?
