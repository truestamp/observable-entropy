      "text": "In preparation for a meeting with my team and management tomorrow morning, I&#x27;m looking for (beefy) articles by well-known, respected people&#x2F;publications that I can use to back up a point I intend to make: that constant demands for progress and&#x2F;or status &quot;updates&quot;, multiple daily meetings for &quot;progress reports&quot; and super-tight deadlines harm productivity, and may be forms of micromanagement.<p>Some quick Googling shows some basic, cursory-overview stuff, along with tons of linkbait &quot;articles&quot; by HR&#x2F;recruiter trash websites (e.g. LinkedIn, indeed, etc.), but I was hoping for something with more substance and credibility, and I&#x27;m not seeing that for some reason.<p>Are there any well-known articles or research papers about this out there (that I&#x27;m obviously not aware of)? I&#x27;m just looking for something I can link to and say &quot;here&#x27;s the proof&quot; when I tell them they&#x27;re micromanaging and not only harming our immediate productivity, but also our long-term sustainability via the acute pressure being created right now.<p>Thanks for your help!",
