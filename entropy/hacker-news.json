      "text": "I was looking at writing a guide to migrate to another identity provider from AWS Cognito and was surprised to learn that there is no bulk export functionality containing passwords.<p>I found this doc, which might be helpful for a user by user migration: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;cognito&#x2F;latest&#x2F;developerguide&#x2F;user-pool-lambda-migrate-user.html You could run this and create users in the new IdP.<p>I found this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;latest&#x2F;cognito-user-profiles-export-reference-architecture&#x2F;cognito-user-profiles-export-reference-architecture.pdf which is good for profile data, but explicitly excludes passwords. I suppose you could bulk migrate everyone using this approach and then require everyone to reset their password?<p>How do people migrate their user data off of AWS Cognito?<p>Full disclosure, I work for a Cognito competitor (link in my profile) and the doc I&#x27;m working on will be published on their site.",
