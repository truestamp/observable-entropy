      "text": "New technologies like GitHub Copilot or OpenAI Codex use public code to train their models to generate code.<p>Is there a license to enforce open source upon output trained from public code? Is there a new license in the works? I don&#x27;t want to prohibit training.<p>I previously thought that current GPL compatible licensed code was enough but I&#x27;ve seen some cases of it being violated under the guise of fair use, with models outputting code without any attribution and relicensed in non-compatible ways.<p>AGPL added a requirement to close the server-side loophole, is there a license that covers the new &quot;AI scraping&#x2F;training loophole&quot; or a new clause perhaps be added to account for AI-training? (i.e. if you train a model using the given code, your model must also allow others to download the source code&#x2F;training set&#x2F;model corresponding to the output)",
