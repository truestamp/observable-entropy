      "text": "I listen to a lot of audiobooks—some of them ripped straight from CDs in lossless quality—on a pair of Airmotiv 4S speakers. While these are far from the best speakers money can buy, most reviews consider them to be high quality studio monitors, appropriate for professional audio engineers (which I am not).<p>I would generally expect these speakers to be overkill for spoken-word content. However, although audiobooks sound quite good, I can definitely tell they&#x27;re being played back on a pair of speakers. I would never mistake them for a person physically in the room with me.<p>Why? Is it possible to create an audio setup for spoken-word content which is indistinguishable from a real person? In other words, if my eyes are closed, I shouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference between a recording and a real person reading out loud in the room. What would it take? Does it come down to the speakers, or how the audio is mastered, or something else?",
