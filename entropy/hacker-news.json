      "text": "Ever since college, I&#x27;ve been used to sleeping very late (we&#x27;re talking +2 AM). Sometimes I would even pull an all-nighter esp. for exams or because I was depressed and would keep myself busy online. I always thought if I say awake a bit longer I can finish this piece of code or answer this homework problem, but I always secretly knew that it&#x27;s not efficient as I wouldn&#x27;t make much progress late at night (my performance after 11 PM is almost 5%).<p>Also, waking up early has been almost a challenge for me, and I can&#x27;t say how many opportunities I&#x27;ve missed because of that. I&#x27;m almost 30 now and I clearly see a huge reduction in my energy, yet I still sleep very late and wake up late.<p>There has to be a better way. As a kid, I used to be up for school between 6:30-7:30 AM and I would go to bed before 12 AM. I believe going to college changed lots of my good habits. Now I&#x27;m in grad school and seriously need to correct my sleep patterns. I appreciate any tips or help from my fellow HN&#x27;ers.",
