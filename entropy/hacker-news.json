      "text": "It was the best of times: Science™ delivered in record time a perfect vaccine for a newly-emerged super-virus. Millions promptly lined up to get protected from the super-virus. The go-alongs got their jabs as the months progressed not because they were worried about the super-virus, but to do their part in getting the government to let life get back to normal.<p>It was the worst of times: a vocal minority refuses to get vaccinated, and are successfully throwing their sabo [0] into the public health machine. Some of those who are <i>In Rebellion Against Science™</i> consist of airline pilots, nuclear scientists, soldiers, police officers, teachers, doctors and other medical workers, people who&#x27;ve already recovered from COVID-19, protestors against &#x27;vaccine passports&#x27;, etc.<p>I proudly count myself among the vocal minority. I suspect I have an auto-immune condition already, think the jab could possibly finish me off, and have obtained the anti-serotonin drug cyproheptadine in case I happen to catch SARS-CoV-2.<p>Got myself another -4 HN comment recently by trying and failing to preach my own understanding of settled science. I noticed a single upvote before a brigade of Dark Helmet Downvoters [1] arrived.<p>Decades ago scientists figured out that excess oxygen is toxic &amp; invasive ventilation harms lungs [2]. There is a simple antidote for oxygen toxicity. While ventilators are sometimes useful, they are known to not help with pneumonia. There would&#x27;ve been no need to worry about SARS-CoV-2 if Medicine™ hadn&#x27;t forgotten best practices for patients whose oxygen levels are low.<p>I am submitting this as a Poll so the silent minority can anonymously share what they really think, without risking getting downvoted.<p>[0] Sabo&#x2F;Sabotage &amp; Star Trek VI - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cKLIivrA3g0<p>[1] Space Balls reference -  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=o8XddGIaLaU<p>[2] <i>The Folly of Medical Hyperventilation</i> - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxiwars.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;06&#x2F;folly-medical-hyperventilation.html",
