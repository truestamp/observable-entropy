      "text": "Hi folks,<p>I work at a Series A startup with a B2B SaaS product.<p>We have 8 employees and about 12 months of runway. I’m the only person doing sales &amp; marketing full time (the founders do the pitching and I do most everything else. I’m somewhere between a overpaid BDR and underpaid director of SalesOps&#x2F;MarketingOps).<p>Right now we have one very large customer and they love us, but in the 9 months I’ve been there we haven’t closed anything new. Although I’m concerned we aren’t doing enough to close that second customer the founders don’t seem very concerned with our speed of growth or my performance.<p>I’ve heard this “if we build it they will come in good time” sort attitude is fairly typical with VC-backed startups. How does it typically play out? Where is the inflection point at which things start to get nasty?",
