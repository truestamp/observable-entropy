      "text": "A few years back I read an article or essay posted here on HN about an American Author&#x2F;Poet(?) who deeply valued his solitude living out in the boonies (he did have electric and telephone I believe).<p>As he grew older (possibly into his 80&#x27;s) I think a medical condition or two required him to accept assistance now and again. But even after a few hours of help with cleaning or otherwise he couldn&#x27;t wait for this valued help to leave him despite his appreciation.<p>It feels like an Atlantic or New Yorker piece but sadly the search engines are now poisoned due to COVID &quot;loneliness&quot; SEO and I can&#x27;t find this article&#x2F;essay.<p>I have a rough date range when I think I saw this on HN on the front page which would be 2011-2014.<p>Any help would be appreciated.",
