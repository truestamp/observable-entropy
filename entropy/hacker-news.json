      "text": "As my partner and I raise our nearly 1 year old child we are constantly looking for her to reach milestones. The prescribed advice from our doctor as well as reasonable online resources has us tracking development in stints that seem to go about a month each. And it is stressful, not unlike pressure of software development. My partner, who is not a software engineer, finds the process almost overwhelming. As we are getting near the release of version 1.0 (her first birthday) I have to wonder: is this right? Frankly it is not what I was expecting nor would wish for. I do not want to raise a daughter like a scrum project. It seems that child development ought to be paced more naturally.",
