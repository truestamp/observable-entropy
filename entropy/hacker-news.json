      "text": "I&#x27;ve been writing Typescript in a shared repo lately. I&#x27;ve noticed that rather than using classes, many opt for functions and data (which is the &quot;FP way&quot;).<p>I can&#x27;t help but want OOP for situations where encapsulation is helpful. Creating boundaries around code with similar level of abstraction is useful. The opposite is what we have in Typescript - every file is a bag of functions and data with no clear distinction between parts that may do file IO and business logic.<p>After re-reading my whining, maybe this is more of a &quot;Tell HN&quot;. lol.",
