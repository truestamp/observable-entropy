      "text": "I&#x27;m 33 and since I started working I&#x27;ve went through 6 companies - the shortest tenure was an year, the others in the 1.5-2.5 years range. I&#x27;m at a stable place right now for about a year, leading a small team at a BigCo with nice colleagues and learning. Despite the fact that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with this current place, friends talked to me about opportunities paying 50% more in teams led by amazing people and I&#x27;m tempted. I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;ll apply, I just wanted to give some personal context and ask HN if:\n- job hopping hurts long term career growth at management level and above \n- it&#x27;s better to find a good spot and stay there as long as possible given the incoming stagflation&#x2F;high rates &#x2F;recession scenario \nThank you!",
