      "text": "I don&#x27;t know where to go from here.<p>A life changing (and semi brain-altering) event happened to me around 2-3 years ago. The gist of my current situation is that i&#x27;m trying to fix my mind and body while also trying to catch up professionally. I&#x27;ve been in the software industry as a programmer since 2014, though I don&#x27;t have a CS degree. In terms of my skills&#x2F;resume, to a company&#x27;s eyes, I have an in-demand technical skillset (&quot;Web UI&quot;) though I feel like i&#x27;ve been stagnant for the last 3 years due to being demotivated about my physical and mental state during this time. I did not work on very successful projects at work (unsuccessful due to business, not developers), and also did not work on any side projects. I do not have any public examples of work.<p>I second guess myself in technical interviews to an embarrassing level. My current position has me as senior level, but I just don&#x27;t feel &quot;senior&quot;. I would say my actual experience level is that more of a mid-level, with how my skills have degraded over the last few years.<p>I&#x27;d like to return to a product company rather than continuing being a contractor.<p>Has anyone felt like they needed to take a lower salary role for less stress?<p>Reading over how disjointed my thoughts are just really set in how much work I still need to do. I would honestly really appreciate any and all advice I receive on anything i&#x27;ve mentioned in this post.",
