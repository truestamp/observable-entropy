      "text": "I recently aquired a safety deposit box at my local bank and would like to use it to store some items. After doing a few searches regarding the boxes, I found several accounts of unauthorized access occurring from bank employees.<p>I was wondering if anyone knows of or has ideas for a device that I could leave inside the box that would keep count on the number of times the box is opened.<p>It would have to be non resetting and reliable enough to not give false counts.<p>Ideally a low power device that could operate for  months or years without the need to change the battery that would record a time&#x2F;date stamp of each time it was opened and closed.<p>My only idea so far is some sort of light sensor tied to a data logger arduino setup with simple encryption but I am concerned the power consumption of an arduino may drain batteries too quickly even in sleep mode.<p>Thoughts?",
