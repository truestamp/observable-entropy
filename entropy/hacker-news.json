      "text": "Hello!<p>I am working on a text classifier but at the moment im quite lost on what to do.<p>The classes form a tree with three levels, for example: class A (level 1), class A.1 (level 2, subclass of A) and class A.1.a (level 3, subclass of A.1).<p>I have a lot of texts but without labels, also its hard to create a set of labeled data because of the big number of classes.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at word embeddings, clustering algorithms, topic modeling, keyword extraction algorithms and other approaches but im not sure whats would be a good way to proceed.<p>Also im not sure how to evaluate the success of the classifier, maybe i could build a small dataset but i wanted to know if there was any other option<p>At the moment the idea that i like most is classifying by the level of the class, for example: given a text t, get the first level class of t, lets say B, then get the second level class of t (only taking the subclasses of B), lets say B.4, and finally get the third level class of t (only taking the subclasses of B.4), lets say B.4.c, and finally we could say that the class of t is B.4.c.<p>So i wanted to ask here for advices to continue on this classifier and evaluate its success, thanks! :)",
