      "text": "So I got an Android (Samsung A52S 5G, $200 deal) for the first time ever since growing up on iPhone (I think I was 15 and got a 3GS, time flies!) a couple of months ago. I do Software development &#x2F; Web Development for work, so you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be a harder target to be messed with... But here I am rotating passwords, knowing damn well theres too much data to change to feel certain nothing has been leaked.<p>Long before, when I first played around with my Android, I&#x27;ve noticed the Twitch.tv app played in the background just fine. Nothing unusual right? Thing is, it also did that whenever I closed the app through the app switcher.<p>Fast forward to today and I am still in bed, it was 7am when I heard two men say my name out loud -- through the speakers of my phone. Me having just woken up this moment, I figured i misheard something. I pick up the phone, look at it and hear my name again. This time with a subtle laugh going on in the background. I was shocked, turned off the phone, factory reset just now with a couple of important passwords changed via my laptop.<p>I am not sure why I am posting here, I just needed to vent I guess. I feel horrible right now.",
