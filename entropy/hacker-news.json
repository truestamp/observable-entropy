      "text": "I’ve been hopping around a number of large non-FAANG enterprises for the past few years. In each, I keep observing a pattern - people seem uninterested in writing System Design &#x2F; Architecture documentation.<p>I struggle to grok a system if I can’t read about the context. What are the goals&#x2F;antigoals? What constraints was the system built under? What big architectural choices were evaluated? (e.g Serverless vs Containers)<p>Digging deeper I also see a lack of consideration for non-functional attributes like Performance, Capacity and High Availability.<p>Cloud paradigms can help to an extent with auto-scaling etc., but I feel there should still be a model for the expected Perf&#x2F;Capacity, given the selected SW+HW stack.<p>In the case of High Availability, I continully see teams running critical Prod services without clearly documenting the expected behaviour if an Instance, AZ&#x2F;Datacentre, Region or  an external dependency goes down.<p>All of these observations have been in highly regulated industries with significant tech budgets.<p>So HN:<p>Do you teams document these architectural designs?<p>Have I perhaps lost touch with modern practices?<p>How do you grow teams (or defend the design from Mgmt &#x2F; Auditors) if this information is held in peoples heads?<p>Appreciate your input and apologies as English is my second language.",
