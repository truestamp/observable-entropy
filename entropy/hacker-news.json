      "text": "I want to setup a search engine that only shows me results from sites I want to see to use occasionally. I found programmablesearchengine.google.com which seemed good, added a bunch of sites (couple of subreddits, blogs of thoughtful people, HN etc.) but I am disappointed with the results.<p>For one, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have advanced features like &#x27;search only for results between those dates&#x27;, for another the results it gives aren&#x27;t good. E.g. when I google &#x27;favorite sites&#x27; it returns 1 result (which is from HN) but when I google &#x27;reddit slatestarcodex favourite sites&#x27; (with either normal or the programmable google) it correctly returns a bunch from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;slatestarcodex&#x2F; even if the &#x27;reddit slatestarcodex&#x27; part seems redundant as it&#x27;s already in my list. This obviously makes it much less useful because I don&#x27;t get the results that well unless I specify the site.<p>Is there a better alternative? Another search engine that offers you to setup larger lists of sites (rather than just doing site:..) or something else built on top of Google?",

But guess what, there&#x27;s a certain industry that&#x27;s still clinging to the usability and security standards from the desktop era of the 2010s. Poorly designed UIs, bombardments of ads, random popups, scams, etc. This industry operates in such a shady way that we as users rather keep their products in incognito mode.<p>We say no more and offer you the following solution:<p>USER EXPERIENCE<p>- Mobile first and native-like UI design.\n- Beautiful dark mode that&#x27;s easy on your eyes.\n- Instant navigations, smooth scrolling, touch gestures.\n- Can be added to the home screen for fullscreen and quick access (PWA).\n- No annoying ads and popups.<p>PRIVACY PROTECTION<p>- All data is stored locally in browser storage.
