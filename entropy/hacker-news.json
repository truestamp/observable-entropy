      "text": "I am a generalist and have worked in early-stage startups thus having done various roles: Developer, Dev Rel, Sales, Marketing, Success, Operations, etc, across different industries, learning being my key skill.\nWhile I am grateful to have worked in various roles, there is a certain joy I get while programming. I am not the best programmer anymore but can learn and get stuff done. In the last 5 years I have worked on an iOS app, a Web app &amp; scraped and parsed 100K plus pages for a friend, built a Google sheet addon, partly built and manage a data pipeline &amp; Dashboard, and am dabbling with Unity right now.<p>I want to transition back to Software development by going into a developer advocate role so that I can leverage all my client-facing experience and code on a daily basis. I am hoping that this will allow me to build a micro SaaS in the next few years to set up a parallel income stream or become a CTO with a strong product &amp; strategy mindset in a few years.<p>I am probably going to lose the option to be a product executive in the future, but I feel I will get bumped out of the PM role anyway. I am very confident in my Product &amp; Strategy skills, I have correctly predicted changes in many of the industries I have worked with (but my employers did not)<p>I am guessing I can be more relevant to organization at the intersection of Technical and Business roles, thus I am also inclined to work for an org which has developers as their TG.<p>Side note<p>1. This is a throw away account, and I surprisingly don&#x27;t have imposter syndrome.<p>2. This is a repost as my first post probably got flagged",
