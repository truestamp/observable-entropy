These 2 frameworks not only provide a good developer experience, but they also allow you to create fast ecommerce storefronts. This provides users with a good experience when using an online store.<p>In addition, as Medusa is a headless commerce platform, developers can create a custom storefront with any frontend framework of their choice. They just need to interact with the REST APIs.<p>If you were to create an ecommerce storefront and had full freedom to choose which frontend framework to use for the storefront, which would you pick and why?",

It was 5th product of the day and it went way better then I expected (107 upvotes) . The github repository got 61 stars and is growing. The website itself got 40K requests, 4.8k unique visitors. Most of the traffic came from HackerNews and ProductHunt. I did not do any marketing other than posting on these social media channels.",
