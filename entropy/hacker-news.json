      "text": "Im a professional tattoo artist and and I&#x27;ve been collecting pictures data in particular pretty extensively for over a decade... I have roughly 2tb cloud storage on each cloud service.. One drive and Google drive. Photos and videos and various graphic file extensions like.. Psd .Tiff .Actn etc... I&#x27;ve grown a bit professionally and so now instead of just dumping new art and photos of my tattoos and marketing graphics etc... I&#x27;m in desperate need of spring cleaning I plan to metatag all photos running them all through lighten cataloging them all and maintain upkeep moving forward from there.  As you know both these services are as useless as tits on a bull, but it is what it is I have to work with one or the other or both. \nFolder to Folder transfers need to be fast or this is going to be impossible  ... Should I do all moving around if files folders etc. On an external HD? then re upload? And please for the love of God someone tell me that there is a tool service or software or poor unfortunate slave out there that can be used to automatically Catagorize photos... One that optically, can analyze each one and determine if it&#x27;s a photo of a tattoo on a person&#x27;s body, differentiating from photos of graphics, artwork, objects... Etc. Please help!! my poor habbits have ruined my digital existence.... MUST LIVE AGAIN!!",
