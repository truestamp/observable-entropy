      "text": "I&#x27;m a one man show on a startup for a SaaS I&#x27;m about to launch. I&#x27;m having the most trouble not with any of the technologies I&#x27;m delaing with, but with the work I can&#x27;t do myself. I am not sure in other countries but in Spain, someone will adevrtise himself as master of its craft. Then he is hired to do 10, he will deliver 5 and not even with enough quality. This applies for lawyers, graphic designers, tax attorneys, etc. Then I will need to  find another lawyer, to go after the initial lawyer for not delivering quality work, and the cycle could go on and on. Professionalism is totally lacking everywhere, and it is very difficult to draw the line and get serious about anything because no one expects that the work to be done should have better quality. It is gotten so bad that I delay reading new incoming emails from these kind of freelancers since I know it will be crap and will ruin my mood for the day. Anyone has similar issues, any advice?",
