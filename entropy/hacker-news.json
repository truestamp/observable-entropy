      "text": "Hey HN, I&#x27;m looking for books on techno-dystopias, I have this idea on my head I can&#x27;t get out and I am sure someone out there has thought about it before and chewed on it enough to make it readable.<p>I hope I am wrong but the future of tech looks grim, it looks like we&#x27;re headed to a Caves of Cud type of future. Anything you could want has already been designed, built and distributed for sale. There was a before-and-after event, some catastrophic event, and literally nothing is usable now, because the people that made it are gone, everything has DRM software in it and trying to use it without a license (prohibitively expensive) or edit it is worth capital punishment in some justice-dispensing-robot&#x27;s brain somewhere, so we&#x27;re back to being basically in 1836, but poor and irradiated.<p>I&#x27;m not well versed in the science fiction literature, have you read such books? What are your favorites? Do you know of any that fit the above description?",
