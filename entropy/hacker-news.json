      "text": "1) Would the fact that the particles interact with the wall edge at the slit affect the results? What if the wall thickness were thinner? Does this affect the resulting pattern? To generate a fringe pattern the slits have to be very small so there is clearly some wall-particle interaction. Wouldn&#x27;t there be atomic interactions that affect the particles?<p>2) If photons, for example, are generated from the same source would they be correlated? Would the same results occur is each photon were generated by a different source? When the photon is &quot;measured&quot; by striking the wall it could affect subsequent measurements.<p>Does anyone know of source papers that address these questions?",
