I assume that logins on the web are based on websites, and since google.com and youtube.com are two different websites, Youtube should not be able to access my Google login.<p>So how does Youtube do it? If this were Chrome, I would assume that it’s some sort of Google integration, but this is Firefox, so there must be a standard web API at work here.",
