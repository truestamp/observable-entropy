      "text": "Product Hunt can be a crap shoot, and having it be worthwhile is tough. You can drive your own audience there but if your product isn&#x27;t applicable to the individual consumer and is more of a business use case, getting noticed is tough.<p>I wrote this in hopes to help inspire new founders that posting on Product Hunt is just like any other marketing campaign. Targeting, messaging, channel, and timing should all be taken into consideration, and you can&#x27;t play scorched earth for upvotes.<p>To avoid ruining our email list with email after email and likely unsubscribes, we focused on our social media, chat apps like Slack and Discord, and mainly LinkedIn 1st degree connections by inviting them to an event on their platform. This is the least intrusive way to see if someone is interested in what you are doing, and their notification architecture is fabulous for keeping the attendees informed.<p>We went about this as respectfully and delightfully as possible. We try to practice conscious notifications at Courier.<p>Let me know what you think,\nMZ\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-notifications-strategy-that-put-us-in-the-product-hunt-newsletter",
