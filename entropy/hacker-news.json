      "text": "Slack&#x27;s nebula VPN is a great networking tool with a focus on performance, simplicity and security based on the Noise Protocol Framework.\nHowever, for many people it is difficult to set up their own VPN, as a Lighthouse server is always required.<p>That is why I started the public Nebula VPN Lighthouse Servers project [2]. This project aims to provide public Lighthouse servers for everyone.\nIt consists of a python based snap app [3] that acts as a web server and allows anyone to use the public servers as a lighthouse for their own VPN.<p>Snap&#x27;s confinement is used to secure the server and users of the service should make sure to lock the Lighthouse out of the network [4].<p>If any of you have the ability to run a public Nebula VPN Lighthouse server, I would appreciate it if you would add your server to the server list [5].<p>As a nebula VPN user, the servers in the list [6] are available to you as public lighthouses.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;slackhq&#x2F;nebula<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manuels&#x2F;nebula-lighthouse-service<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapcraft.io&#x2F;nebula-lighthouse-service<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manuels&#x2F;nebula-lighthouse-service#blocking-out-the-lighthouse-from-your-network<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manuels&#x2F;nebula-lighthouse-service&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;server-list.html<p>[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmlpreview.github.io&#x2F;?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manuels&#x2F;nebula-lighthouse-service&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;server-list.html<p>Disclaimer: This project is not affiliated with Slack Technologies LLC or nebula.",
