      "text": "Dear HN,<p>We just launched a small micro-financing fund for startups and businesses that deal with inventory&#x2F;physical stake.<p>The project is known as Comenda which is a classic form of financing that was used in Europe during the Renaissance. We&#x27;re aiming to revive this.<p>There is currently upto Â£200k ($250k approx) available for startups that meet the funding criteria.<p>The great thing about Comenda is that there is no equity stake required by the investor and there are no interest repayments.<p>Comenda is centred purely around using the inventory as security&#x2F;collateral.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in getting a capital injection for your startup, please check out the website and fill in the form<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comendafinance.com&#x2F;",

      "text": "Hi HN,<p>As the Covid is slowly fading away and the meetup&#x2F;conference season is starting up again, I needed a quick tool to generate various business cards as QR codes. A good excuse to learn about contact card formats (vCard, MeCard).<p>So here it is: you can generate QR codes using the online form, and embed SVG&#x2F;PNG QR codes wherever you like (Website, Markdown, Slides, GitHub README).<p>The app is FOSS and code source is on GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rclement&#x2F;business-card-generator\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rclement&#x2F;business-card-generator</a>",
