      "text": "Hi!\nI&#x27;m hoping to get some feedback on a start-up we&#x27;re working on.<p>Anyone that wants to start a nonprofit fundamentally wants to accept donations, issue tax receipts, and store their donations in a bank account.<p>Currently do all of this, it can take a few days to incorporate, 8-10 months to get a 501c3 from the IRS, and on average a week to get a bank account.<p>.NGO is fintech company that&#x27;s building the infrastructure for the modern internet nonprofit. With our technology, you can skip waiting months and instead start fundraising for your nonprofit, automatically issue tax receipts to your donors, store your funds in a bank account and have an unlimited number of virtual debit cards in order to pay for the expenses of your nonprofit.<p>We have a beta of our product over at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dot.ngo<p>Would love to get some feedback on the idea overall and anyone to try our platform if it interests you.",
