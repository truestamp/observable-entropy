      "text": "Hey HN<p>When looking to start up some sort of business or startup, one thing that comes up is to do a &quot;feasibility analysis&quot; before you invest heavily in making the business go: that is, how feasible is the business? how profitable could it be? how many people are looking for this type of product.. etc.<p>When I look on google for &quot;SaaS feasibility analysis&quot;, I can see many results on conducting one yourself, but is there anyone that can do this as a service that I can pay for? Not only do I feel like I could easily fall victim of my own confirmation bias, but I also want to save a little bit of my own time, and be able to write down some ideas to send them off and a get a report that I can reflect upon later.<p>I&#x27;ve recently been reading &quot;start small stay small&quot; by Rob Walling, and he suggests at minimum doing some search terms and keyword analysis to see how often other people google for these type of things, and how you could show up on the web easier in a niche; there&#x27;s software that can do this for you, or you can spreadsheet this up yourself. Many of the software items seem either abandonware or be wanting to tie in to an already running business..<p>Is setting some tracking analytics on a landing page and email lists the only way to do a feasibility analysis for SaaS ? is it possible to find a professional service that can really do a deep dive on the idea for me?",
