      "text": "I found the recent paper &#x2F; article about data collection by iOS &#x2F; Android very interesting ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28741262 ) and I was trying to find something similar for Windows 10 &#x2F; 11.<p>Aside from anecdotal evidence and lots of scare-mongering &#x2F; click-baity post I failed to find an actual 3rd party privacy audit &#x2F; research paper that goes in-depth in a similar way (do a standard setup of Windows 10 &#x2F; 11, disable any <i>available</i> checkbox for data collection during setup, and MITM all traffic).<p>Yes, I know Microsoft documents the data fields ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;required-windows-diagnostic-data-events-and-fields-2004 ), but we all know documentation trails actual code by quite a bit. The research documentation also includes URLs which are very nice if one would want to &quot;disable&quot; some of the &quot;required diagnostic data&quot; using DNS filters (AdGuard, Pi-Hole) or firewalls. Again, I know Microsoft documents the endpoints ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;manage-windows-11-endpoints ) but the description is overly broad.<p>My goal is to get a general idea of how Windows compares to iOS &#x2F; Android in terms of data collection as well as come up with an updated DNS filter for my home network that preserves functionality I want (Windows Update, Xbox GamePass, OneDrive and Office) while blocking functionality I don&#x27;t want (gratuitous data collection).<p>If such a thing doesn&#x27;t exist, any tips for how to go about DIY-ing would be welcome (I presume a VirtualBox installation with pcap or MITM with pre-installed certificates - I&#x27;m a software engineer with barebones network &#x2F; security knowledge, so more accessible is better).",
