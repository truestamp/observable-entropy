      "text": "Every time I want to try DDG, I find it inconvenient to type its name and press Enter. Try it yourself; the word is not easy to type because of two reasons: (1) It&#x27;s rather long for a search engine, (2) The letters are located on keys that don&#x27;t allow for a smooth typing experience.<p>Call me old fashioned, but I think there have been times that I resorted back to Google just because it&#x27;s easier to type than DuckDuckGo (Bing is even easier).<p>For all the hate Google receives, I think at least their search engine &quot;name&quot; is not as poor of a choice as DuckDuckGo.<p>Edit 1: I know you can add DDG as a search engine in your browser, and I know that you can assign shortcuts to it. But I&#x27;m afraid, that&#x27;s not what 99% of people would do. The name is just weird, hard to type, and long.<p>Edit 2: If you Google DDG, it&#x27;ll show the American rapper instead of DuckDuckGo. They could&#x27;ve come up with a name that&#x27;s not already popular.",
