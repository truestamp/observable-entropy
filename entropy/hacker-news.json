But for me it&#x27;s going crazy sometimes.<p>In the last 12 months I&#x27;ve been doing the following for one company:<p>- architecting software\n- leading an offshore dev team\n- writing PRD\n- wire framing ecommerce website\n- specifying dev portal\n- participate in research meetings\n- rubber duck debugging with AI developer\n- organise MLOps\n- made countless presentations proposing problem solutions\n- writing software (less and less)\n- interviewing candidates\n- gantt charting a roadmap<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with that, but it seems like I&#x27;m going into the direction of a super generalist. I don&#x27;t know what am I good at anymore.<p>Actually I think I know, I can do quick prototypes, know how to sell online, can write decent software. But how does these skills fit into current job market?",
