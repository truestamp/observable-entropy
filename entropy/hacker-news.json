      "text": "Just noticed that an item that was heavily Google searched on one device in my home was now showing up as an advertisement on another device that was using Internet Explorer. This device is purely used for work and that has never once been used for searching for this item or anything remotely related to it. I find this very disturbing, albeit highly coincidental, and I cannot draw any other conclusion (additionally, no other devices pair or interface with the work device in question).",
