      "text": "Hi HN<p>I&#x27;m a web dev, but learned to program android apps in Kotlin this year. I&#x27;ve built an app that lets me send SMS from the web, like google messages or push bullet, for example. I submitted it for review with a video explanation ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;p3SDfcEGexc ) but the rejection  I got was really not helpful :<p>&quot;Unable to verify core functionality of app: Video Error\nWhen you submitted your app, you specified your app&#x27;s core functionality as follows: Cross-device synchronization or transfer of SMS or calls. However, we couldn’t find evidence in your video that the app offers the declared core functionality &quot;<p>I don&#x27;t get it, because to me the video clearly shows what my app does and why it needs access to contacts and SMS. It feels like they didn&#x27;t even watch it. Should I make some of those permissions optional ? Is it just random, and I should resubmit with minor tweaks ? Is it because I&#x27;m a new dev account with no other app published ? Overall, this interaction with Google feels awful and makes me regret the hours I invested into learning Kotlin.",
