      "text": "I have an interview with a company where I would very much like to work. I was planning on taking a month or two to prepare (while having a full time job), but a recruiter happened to contact me before I started prep. I scheduled the interview out two weeks, but I do not feel well prepared. There are algorithms and design sessions during this interview.<p>If I pass the interview, I feel it will be by sheer luck. (getting problems I&#x27;m familiar with)<p>This is a medium to large sized start-up.<p>If I go through with the interview and do poorly, I have no way of knowing when or if I would be given the chance again.<p>I don&#x27;t believe another week of prep would have me in a much better position, so postponing probably wouldn&#x27;t help that much.<p>If I cancel the interview entirely, I&#x27;m not sure how that will come across and if I will be able to try again at another point.<p>Today is Friday, the interview is this coming Tuesday.<p>Long time lurker. Happy to receive feedback from the community.",
