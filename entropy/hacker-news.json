      "text": "I&#x27;ve been using Bitwarden for about 4 years now and cannot understand how a Password Manager does not export attachments when backing up your data. I understand this was the case when the only export format was a CSV file, but now with JSON files I can&#x27;t get my head around the fact that I almost missed crucial SSH keys had I not checked the output. A simple solution would be to b64 encode each file and add it into an array!<p>It&#x27;s even mentioned on their Help page - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitwarden.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;export-your-data&#x2F; but I still think it&#x27;s a bit unacceptable that there isn&#x27;t even a warning in the GUI about this.<p>And yes, I know there are ways to manually export the files, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.",

It all seemed fine, but there was one line like, &#x27;also we can use your information in ways that are in our interests ( or third parties can) if it&#x27;s not not in your interests&quot; which basically leaves the door open for anything they decide to do. What is the point of having any other clauses? What can be done about this madness.",
