Want to get wild with it and check out some of the newer technologies that have been released. I don&#x27;t mean things like redux-toolkit necessarily, but things more like Svelte, Vite, Tailwind, anything like that.<p>Friend&#x27;s project a custom Shopify frontend with SEO requirements, so I&#x27;ve been debating checking out Gatsby or Next&#x27;s new e-commerce stuff.<p>I&#x27;m also just interested in new ideas in frontend that I may have missed. Remix looks kind of interesting, but it&#x27;s not a massive leap from Next from what I&#x27;ve seen.",
