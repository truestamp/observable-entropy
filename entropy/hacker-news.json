The documentation suggests that you can arrive at a port of entry and have the visa approved there. Is that still the case?<p>Do you need to go through a immigration lawyer for the paperwork, or can you provide all the necessary documentation&#x2F;offer of employment letter yourself?<p>Is it possible to receive health insurance from the company you will be working for if you are only there for 6-12 months?<p>Thanks!",
