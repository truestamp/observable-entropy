      "text": "I have been in charge of hiring practices for a while now, but the CEO wants me to make them more inclusive.  I don&#x27;t think my previous practices were non-inclusive. But I do agree with the general idea.  Currently we pre-screen candidates with a phone call and we do some basic problems like &quot;Suppose you had an almost perfectly balanced binary tree with 1023 elements, how deep could it be at most?&quot;, etc.. Then we have an on-site and ask some background questions, do a bit of whiteboarding, and ask about some of their previous projects(or if they have none, then talk general tech and let them lead).<p>My thoughts are currently to remove the whiteboarding and replace it with a more free flowing problem solving session, give an example of a recent issue we have solved and ask their thoughts.  I just don&#x27;t have any great ideas about how this could be better.  Most of our problems are getting pretty in the weeds with very specific technical issues, and ideally the problem solving being tested would be more general.<p>If anyone has any suggestions as to how to make hiring more inclusive without using whiteboarding, take-home assignments or things like that, I would be very happy to hear them.",
