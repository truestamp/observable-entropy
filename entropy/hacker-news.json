      "text": "A few weeks (?) ago I came across a website for drawing and sketching which smoothes everything. So instead of an oneven clearly hand drawn result, all lines become smooth.

But now I think it is useful for drawing logo&#x27;s by hand.<p>I think I saw it on HN, maybe even as a Show HN, but I am not sure and cannot find it. Maybe someone else knows?",
