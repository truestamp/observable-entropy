Might be despite my STEM degree I&#x27;m not good enough, but the lack of interviews I&#x27;m landing means I&#x27;m being filtered out from the start.<p>The way people make it out to be here, those jobs are handed out.<p>So are companies BSing? HN comments BSing? or who is getting these URM jobs?<p>Does anyone have any advice or willing to provide some mentorship?<p>Thanks, on a throw away because this is embarrassing.",
