Inflation in Russia looks to be high but similar to the one in Lithuania for example. Ukraine inflation is lower which in my dilettante view doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>It looks like it&#x27;s business as usual and war doesn&#x27;t really have any impact on global economy at the moment. Prices were going up before Feb anyway.<p>So what&#x27;s going on?",
