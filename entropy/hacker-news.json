      "text": "This may seme like a vague question, but how do people figure out anything related to computer science, such as coding or command line, on their own. It&#x27;s just so unbelievably hard doing the simplest of things. I get tons of error messages or nothing works, even with following a tutorial exactly. The problem is not following the instructions, it is that when you follow the instructions it still does not work. This happens so often.  The problem is made worse by unique system setting, having a different versions of windows, etc. How do people actually learn this or get things done? How is anything done when the guides are so infective? At the pace things are going, I cannot imagine ever actually doing anything useful.",
