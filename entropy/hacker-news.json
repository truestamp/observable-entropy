      "text": "Until recently, i never saw any ads on YT.  This was because of a combination of VPN, strict stealth mode browsing on only YT, fully deleted history on browser exit, and ublock origin js blocking.  We used to never see ads presumably because YT didnt have a solid enough profile on the user that it could bid out CPM.<p>It seems that recently something has changed since we do now see ads.<p>I dont recall specifically but suspect this happened when youtube started to break if user had all js fully blocked (using uBlock).<p>I can tell YT still doesnt know who we are since on the homepage we still get the same clickbait for an unknown profile, which we saw before they started servind ads<p>Are you experiencing the same change?",

      "text": "I bought a $59 USD license for a Windows Desktop program two years ago but did not purchase the optional support at $15&#x2F;year. My PC disk drive crashed and I do not have a backup of the installer for that program. I emailed vendor support and was told my license is perpetual but only for the purchased version and without the support subscription I cannot download the latest version and they do not provide downloads for older versions. It does state in their online support policy that customer is responsible for backing up their installer. So my only recourse is to purchase another license. I guess this is why purchasing support is worth it.<p>Is this normal&#x2F;typical for paid  licensed software?",
