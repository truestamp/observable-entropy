For the last six months, we&#x27;ve been navigating the startup waters and building and improving.<p>We&#x27;re thinking of building a platform that enables teams at mid&#x2F;large sized companies to build, run, and scale applications in AWS (and soon other cloud providers) without forcing developers to become cloud experts.<p>Practically speaking, our product would be your internal developer platform where you (DevOps&#x2F;Platform&#x2F;Site Reliability Engineers) can build boilerplates &#x2F; templates for your teams that meet your business requirements. Then, the developers can quickly deploy&#x2F;launch these templates&#x2F;boilerplates in an &quot;App Store&quot; type of fashion with the &quot;Heroku&quot;-like experience. The end goal is avoid having developers install unnecessary CLI tools or managing kubernetes clusters.<p>Building this solution would help developers move at their own pace and give Platform&#x2F;DevOps&#x2F;Site Reliability engineers more time back.<p>Before we continue to pour more effort in to this, is it something that you think you&#x27;d personally setup and give to your developers?",
