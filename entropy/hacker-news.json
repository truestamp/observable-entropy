      "text": "Unfortunately, a close acquaintance of mine is being stalked on Facebook by a troubled person they were once friends with. We suspect they are utilizing this method of temporary deactivations:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;id&#x2F;wbna46808719<p>Basically they can&#x27;t block them or even see if they are friends with them unless they happen to be online long enough to search.<p>The easy answer is to not use Facebook but unfortunately Facebook is desired for posting and sharing photos with international family members and friends.<p>What is the next best way to solve this problem? Can we get in contact with someone at Facebook somehow to get a setting that simply unfriends people that deactivate their accounts repeatedly?",
