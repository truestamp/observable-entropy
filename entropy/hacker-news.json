      "text": "Context: I&#x27;ve been working on what started as a side-project with a few really smart and creative folks for around a year. They&#x27;ve recently decided to go full-time on this project since we&#x27;ve honestly created a stellar product and looks like getting funding won&#x27;t be a big problem for the seed round. Even though I&#x27;m super passionate about this project, given the US H1-B regulation and the fact that my day job is sponsoring my green card application, I can&#x27;t leave my work or even work for another company while being employed by my current employer.<p>Question: So, how do I go about negotiating some equity for all the work I&#x27;ve put in over the past year and what would be a reasonable number to ask?<p>tl;dr Side project is turning into a startup and I can&#x27;t legally work on it anymore because of visa rules. How do I go about negotiating equity in this startup?",
