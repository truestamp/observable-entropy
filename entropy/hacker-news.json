      "text": "Does anyone want to work with me and engineer or market a $5,000 tiny home — the blueprints will be open source, but also manufacture at scale if there is demand. This home would have a solar roof, small battery, water tank, will arrive in a IKEA-like box worldwide. It should allow a 6.5 ft person sleep comfortably and should be movable with a forklift. Think a next generation home for the homeless. Should withstand regular weather for 20 years. DM me. I could invest some $50k to start this venture if we can form a team.",

      "text": "Merry Xmas and happy holidays HN. I rarely post here but would like the community&#x27;s help.<p>In short, my high spend (platinum, on track to be diamond?) 7-year-old Uber account was banned yesterday, and I have been trapped in a Kafka-esque, situation with support saying they will&#x2F;cannot do anything.  Support did drop a hint that my account has seen suspicious activity.<p>I am turning HN for help, e.g. if someone could get me in touch with more sympathetic&#x2F;&quot;human&quot; channels. (From experience, it seems like sometimes HN could get Uber&#x27;s attention in cases such as this.)<p>Thanks all!<p>--<p>The timeline of events is the following:<p>1. I got a new phone, and setup my credit card in Apple Pay, but didn&#x27;t enter the CVV code.\n2. Uber App on the new phone defaulted to the new card (seems to be a bug on Apple&#x27;s end). \n3. Payment was rejected, which is probably the suspicious activity trigger.<p>I reached out to support and subsequently was told my account was banned. Further communications were stonewalled.",
