Unlike other spaced repetition apps, we&#x27;ve (really) prioritised making Save All as simple as possible - minimalist design, no distractions, and minimal cognitive load placed on users.<p>We achieve this simplicity by using machine learning (e.g. large language models like BERT, GPT) to reduce the number of decisions users have to make.  You don&#x27;t have to decide whether you remembered a card, we know whether you did. You don&#x27;t have to decide how to be quizzed on your information, we&#x27;ll decide for you.<p>We&#x27;re VC funded &amp; growing fast but would love to hear HN&#x27;s critical feedback. Tell it to us how it is!",
