      "text": "Last year the redit group WallStreetSilver attempted to put the squeeze on the silver shorters  by buying paper silver. This failed and it became very apparent that the paper silver markets are heavily manipulated through spoofed short sells and derivative quantities of paper silver being traded between the banks to drive spot markets down.<p>Fast forward to this year and it seems there is a new approach to squeezing the market but this time it is being attempted through the hoarding of physical silver rather than paper warrants.<p>Apparently Bank of America has a 300 million ounce short position on silver that is coming due on Jan 30th and there is a belief that the COMEX does not have the physical silver to cover this.<p>So the question is: If the price of silver begins to rise, at what price point do you think it would be worth selling off the heirlooms?<p>PS: It seems the values of antique silver things are already quite high!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifranks.com&#x2F;silver-tea-sets",

      "text": "I would be interested to see the behavior for other users.  This seems to be the case with any search under my account.  For example, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=programmer tells me there are 234 million results on page 1, but returns only 3 pages.  When I get to the 3rd page it reports that &quot;Page 3 of about 236 results&quot; and that is the end of my search.  This truncated search results behavior occurs with every search term I have tried and I have noticed that if I log out I can continue to see page after page of results.  What is even stranger and somewhat unsettling is that I get different results depending on who I am logged in as.  If I log in under a relative&#x27;s under-used account they see 274 million results and can view all pages as if they are not logged in.",
