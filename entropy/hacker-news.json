      "text": "I&#x27;m considering pursuing a marketplace business idea that would involve facilitating ACH payments directly from customer A to customer B (without my company in the middle). For a few reasons I can&#x27;t just use Stripe&#x2F;Dwolla&#x2F;etc.<p>There&#x27;s some good info online about this (see Gusto&#x27;s helpful post [1]) but for the first step of partnering with a bank, they all basically just say &quot;You have to find a bank willing to serve as your ODFI.&quot;<p>So my question is, does anyone know what that process is like, and how hard it is? Do I just make a business account with Wells Fargo or SVB and then request this service? What are my chances of approval? Anything else I can expect from the process? Any advice would be much appreciated.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.gusto.com&#x2F;how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-1&#x2F;",
