      "text": "I&#x27;ve been sick two weeks ago and had lots of time to spare while laying on the couch. I used that for viewing too much stuff on YouTube.<p>Here are some findings (German user) and I&#x27;d like your experience on this. Maybe it&#x27;s anecdotal but I&#x27;ve got the feeling YouTube is really going down the drain.<p>- _lots of_ ads everywhere<p>- I got unskippable 15 second pre-roll ads on 17 second videos<p>- I got three pre-roll ads regularly, even on short videos and smaller channels<p>- I got lots of post-roll ads, too<p>- I&#x27;ve got lots of video ads where pharmaceutical companies are promoting to &quot;talk to your doctor about the vaccine for XY&quot; - wtf, is this even legal?<p>- Ads load better than the video<p>- In-App ads are directly from the shady&#x2F;scummy section: &quot;get rich quick&quot;-schemes&#x2F;courses, cartoonish erotic apps, phone optimizer apps, &quot;lose 30 pounds in 30 days&quot;-fitness apps, &quot;free&quot; book downloads with signup pages from hell, probably fake IPO signups, crypto investment apps... the list goes on...<p>- after reporting too many of those ads, I&#x27;ve lost the function to report any ad at all. I&#x27;m not kidding, the menu item is just gone.<p>- recommendations are showing me lots of videos I&#x27;ve watched before OR are totally unrelated to what I&#x27;m interested in<p>- recommendations are often filled with videos from 6 to 10 years ago<p>All in all YouTube seems to be a total shitshow and it feels like they don&#x27;t care anything at all about the user experience.<p>With all those scummy ads I felt like 15 years ago on some crazy &quot;free movie downloadz&quot;-website but not on THE biggest video platform of the world.<p>Does Google&#x2F;YT care so little? Have they automated and laid off everybody who could veto against all those &quot;create your sexy arabian princess and play with her&quot;-apps or all the &quot;phone optimizers&quot; who are going to do god knows what with your phone?<p>What&#x27;s your experience on YT these days? Is it similar to mine or totally different?<p>I really like lots of the content, but the surroundings...",
