Seems like a bunch of fantastic engineering challenges. However, outside of some home arduino and esp32 projects, I&#x27;ve never done any embedded development.<p>Is anyone working as an embedded engineer, in or out of the space industry? How can I learn more and see if it might be a fit for me? Do you like what you do?",
