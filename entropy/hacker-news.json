      "text": "I built this websocket game with the intent of learning the actor model with Actix, and getting better with Rust. The front end is made with Svelte, though I&#x27;m not really a frontend person, so if you poke around it&#x27;s bound to be clunky. I&#x27;ve tested it with with Chrome, Firefox and Android, but not iOS or Safari. If you find errors with those, I&#x27;d appreciate a quick note.<p>I have yet to clean up the frontend, but you can find the backend source <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kilroyjones&#x2F;game-server\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kilroyjones&#x2F;game-server</a>, if you&#x27;re curious. This could have been built with socket.io, but who doesn&#x27;t want to spend more than double the time building a higher performance server to push around 100 bytes of JSON?<p>The game is cooperative because I enjoy cooperative play more than competition, and wanted to build something that pushed people to work together. There&#x27;s no in-game communication, so you really need to pay attention to what your teammates are doing.<p>If you want to see what the game is like, but players aren&#x27;t there, you can load up four windows and it&#x27;ll work fine as well.<p>Advice, comments and criticism are welcome.",
