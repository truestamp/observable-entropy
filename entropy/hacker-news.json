      "text": "Hi all,<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a new programming language called Blade for a couple of months now and think it&#x27;s time I introduced it to people and get reactions and feedbacks. Plus, I need people to test it and find the bugs in it.<p>The repository is at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blade-lang&#x2F;blade and the documentation is in progress and going great at bladelang.com and even though I wanted to wait to write everything before I do this before, I think it&#x27;s best to get started with letting people know about it now.<p>There are lots of tests in the repository and experienced developers can basically pick up the language looking at those tests and by reading through the bundled libraries.<p>There&#x27;s also a Visual Studio code extension for easy syntax highlighting in the VS code marketplace (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=blade-lang.blade-vscode).<p>Also, I am greatly wishing that I&#x27;ll find some contributors through this post who can fix some of the things I might be missing on and who may as well be interested in contributing libraries to it. The process of doing so is really straight forward and I&#x27;m available to guide anyone through the process.<p>Feedbacks are highly appreciated and treated with upmost priority.<p>Thanks all!",
