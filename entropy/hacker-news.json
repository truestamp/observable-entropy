Right now I&#x27;m using Clickup and Airtable–when it comes to Social Media Posts Approval–but I&#x27;m looking for better solutions.<p>Basically, once my customer subscribes to one of our tiers, he&#x2F;she will be redirected with instructions on how to submit all the requests.<p>Customers may do this by Email (Using Zendesk) or Clickup, maybe Airtable. What do you think is the best option when it comes to Web Design and Development? Please, leave your comment of your suggestion and experience.",
