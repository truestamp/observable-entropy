For further information see Teams&#x2F;Dpkg&#x2F;MergedUsr(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.debian.org&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;Dpkg&#x2F;MergedUsr).<p>So every recent Debian installation is broken?\nIf so, why no one talks about it?",

      "text": "Hi, I&#x27;ve been developing an HTML5 MMORPG game where people can submit code to play a game, like collect items, destroy defense towers or kill monsters, etc.. I&#x27;ve been working on this for over 1.5 yrs (all my spare time) and now it&#x27;s ready for preview, does anyone want to try it out? It&#x27;s mostly opensource (and the rest will be opensource sooner or later)<p>Please access it with PC, it&#x27;s an HTML5 game: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bytelegend.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bytelegend.com&#x2F;</a><p>I really want it to expand to more languages, but right now I&#x27;ve only finished Java part. I wonder if anyone can help me with other languages. Besides, I&#x27;m not a good game story designer, but I really really want it to be a game with a fantastic story. Any help will be appreciated.",
