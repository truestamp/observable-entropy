      "text": "My team and I are building something really interesting for homebuyers. Here in Ireland we have a problem with housing demand and the market is pretty hot. People need information around the bidding process like never before. We can provide this. The problems we solve can be seen the world over but Ireland is a particularly good &quot;petri dish&quot; to ensure good PM fit.\nWe have interest from lenders (B2B revenue) but investors, including our government&#x27;s investment vehicle, Enterprise Ireland, are quite shy of B2C risk. We have solid plans for getting users but as a result of the reluctance of investors to come in to the first round, we have pivoted to a more B2B start, helping property developers derisk construction finance in a manner so as to help us get users also. Hopefully things work out on our new path - it&#x27;s looking good.<p>However, I am curious. When presented with something disruptive as we are creating, with the benefits and obvious help for the consumer as I hope the reader will trust we bring, for the sake of discussion, are US based seed investors shy of B2C risk, even with verifiable interest from B2B revenue partners?<p>It feels like our second round will break records, but the first is very difficult (or has been before recent pivot at least.)<p>- We don&#x27;t have a requirement that we hit say 20% of buyers before we provide benefits to our users. We provide tangible benefits even to one user buying one home.\n- We can roll put in a manner so as to maximise the chances of having good user interactions on a per-property basis so as to give a good user experience from the get-go, even if not universally available in a market until user numbers are good\n- We have the team we need at this stage\n- We require small capital to get rolling and would attract significant grant funding, crowd-funding interest, etc",

      "text": "I&#x27;m preparing a ≈20min talk about opportunities in software to give at a London school with students aged 14-18. I want to give insights into the software industry which are relevant to the decisions students will be making: which subjects to study or focus on at school, whether to go to uni, but more generally how to invest time well by learning valuable skills and discovering what their strengths are and what they might like to do in the future. As part of my preparation, I&#x27;d like to collect some real examples of journeys people make from their teens into professional software roles, but also how programming skills may have served you well as a hobby or in roles that aren&#x27;t primarily about developing software. What&#x27;s your story?<p>Some questions I&#x27;m interested in are:\nHow did you first get into programming? Were any books, blogs, forums, or people particularly helpful for your growth? What is it about coding that got you hooked?<p>What is your experience with university? Did you get a degree, was it worth it, do you think it helped you find work, what did you love&#x2F;hate about uni?<p>How did you get your first paid work (family &amp; friends, internship, freelance, full-time)?<p>What do you do now and what do you love&#x2F;hate about your job?<p>------\nI work back end in Golang at a fintech, but I got into programming when I was homeschooled with ROBLOX and making iOS games with cocos2d before doing an MEng in Computing at Imperial College London. I really like making things, intellectual work, and collaborating with other people. I like the pay, that I can find remote work or move country if I want, that I&#x27;m always learning, and I have enough time and energy to pursue various hobbies. Sometimes work is tedious and I don&#x27;t like sitting at a desk for 8 hours, but overall I love my job and want to help others find their way into similar roles if it&#x27;s right for them.",
