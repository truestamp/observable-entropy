      "text": "It’s been known since https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1904.09828 that you could build a turning machine from Magic The Gathering (and it’s sort of obvious anyhow), but I was wondering if you could create an actual playable 52-card-deck game that played like the essentials of a TM. I started doing this - deal each player 5 cards then deal 10 for the “tape”, and had some starting rules for how you write a program from your five cards (incl moves and put&#x2F;take). The cool part is of course that you can use the “read” (captured) cards in your program! (Sort a 1&#x2F;2 UTM), but didn’t get very far. I thought this might make an interesting HN challenge.",
