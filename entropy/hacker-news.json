      "text": "That mirrors the collective expertise and lower noise ratio that exists here. Subreddits like &#x2F;r&#x2F;gamedev are mostly novice posts and people venting. gamedev.net mostly exists for posting questions. VFX&#x2F;game art subreddits are really cool, though mostly exist to show off. It&#x27;s good all of these places exist, and I&#x27;m not complaining about them. It&#x27;s just that it splits the community into individual secs and there&#x27;s little crossover (that I can tell).<p>There are many disciplines that coalesce together to create a video game, and there are around 300,000 people working in the field.
