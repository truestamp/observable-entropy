      "text": "It&#x27;s often hard to summon the constant motivation needed to single-handedly build a web app or bootstrap a startup. When I&#x27;ve run out of my personal reserves, what are some movies and TV shows that will recharge them? I&#x27;m not talking about media that&#x27;s just <i>about</i> tech. I&#x27;m thinking of movies like The Social Network and (the first) Iron Man, and TV shows like Silicon Valley and Halt &amp; Catch Fire - media that  captures the spirit of coding, building or engineering something. Alternatively, sales films that aren&#x27;t technical but capture the &quot;soft skills&quot; needed to build something to profitability, like persistence and hard work, eg. The Pursuit of Happyness.",
