      "text": "When I got into this industry 10 years ago, the world was a completely different place. Bootcamps weren&#x27;t a thing. Computer Science programs were still something just for the nerds. And the industry was almost entirely autodidacts like myself who grew up immersed in technology and did it for the joy of it. Fast forward, and now literally everyone and their uncle wants to be a software dev, and CS programs are churning out hundreds of thousands of graduates. The thought of competing against someone credentialled with 4-5 years experience vs. myself with 10 years and no credentials, seems hopeless. It almost seems like the path I took would be completely impossible today.",
