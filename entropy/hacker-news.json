      "text": "Hey guys, I&#x27;m starting with Rails, I&#x27;ve created some random easy projects and still learning and improving my skills on Rails. I&#x27;m learning Rails cuz I&#x27;m so interested in entrepreneurship so I wanna be able to develop my ideas. Recently I&#x27; ve been following a guy who is called Johnny Boufarhat, he is the founder and CEO of Hopin, an events platform that allows people attend events remotely, and due Covid, Hopin just blowed up. In an interview of Johnny Boufarhat, he said that he developed the entire first version of Hopin himself. His background is mechanical engineering, so he doesn&#x27;t have any degree from computer science, but he is a self-taught coder. First version of Hopin was an app like zoom&#x2F;skype that allowed more participants, up to 100,000, he has had dealing with some technologies like webrtc and so on. In the same interview he said that he built first version of Hopin with Rails, Amazon, PostgreSQL, which most people pretty much expect from a startup. But, is is true that only one person is be able to develop such product without any external help? Is Rails so powerful that can allow people to develop such heavy projects like Hopin and build it without any help&#x2F;team?",
