      "text": "sha1 hashes are not secure, and collisions can be practically produced by attackers.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if these attack strategies could one day be used to find collisions for the pieces in a bittorrent archive to effectively &quot;recover&quot; the data that was originally used to create the bittorrent archive.<p>Let&#x27;s say the piece size is 4 KiB, that means there are 2^(8x4x1024) possible combinations of bytes for each piece. That is a number with almost 10 thousand digits. Could these sha1 collision attack strategies be used to cut down on the number of combinations we&#x27;d have to comb through to find the matching 4 KiB of binary that original produced the hash?<p>Either way, I&#x27;m interested to learn more about how this works. Thanks.",
