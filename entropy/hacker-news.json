It&#x27;s our family home from when I was growing up, 2 stories and my dad currently crawls his way up the stairs each day to use his computer. He won&#x27;t even consider moving down to the first floor (stubborn).<p>I have my own young family and my partner and I have jobs, so I&#x27;m basically looking for how you juggled your way through this part of life and if you have any pointers.
