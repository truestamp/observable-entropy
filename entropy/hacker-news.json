      "text": "I received an offer at a Series C startup as the &quot;Director Data Science&quot; reporting to VP who reports to C level. Company was pre money ~450M in last round in April. Here are the details:<p>Salary: 205\nBonus: up to 18%\nBenefits: Solid affordable health care and &quot;uncapped&quot; vacation \nStock: 18k options. No details in offer about the value. But i have access to research and the preferred stock price is around $8.<p>I&#x27;m pretty happy the the title, cash, bonus, and what the company is doing. But i feel that the shares for the responsibility i would have is low. My question is this. One, am i right to think the share amount is low? Two, I have some FANG interviews coming up for Data Science roles. I&#x27;ve been studying LEET code for a while and think i have a good shot. Should i hold out to see what they would offer me?",
