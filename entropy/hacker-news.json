When I click on the link it sends me to a Russian shopping website that has nothing to do with my search[0,1].<p>I have seen some scam&#x2F;spam search results in the past that are unrelated to my query, but usually I find through CMD-f that they have a ton of random words, many of which match my query, in the same color as the background of the website and so I figured that&#x27;s how they tricked Google.<p>But here is different, in the Google cache[2] of the page there is a totally different html result&#x2F;url than where I am taken - it is almost entirely filled with SEO keywords, and it is a different URL then clicking on the Google result takes me too.<p>I assumed there was some redirects along the way but trying to track the requests using online redirect tracking tools like Redirect Detect [3] just yields 404s.<p>How are these websites able to do this? And how is a company with the resources of Google not able to detect such blatant spam like this? I understand how SEO websites get the top search results when they are topic adjacent - but it baffles me that Google is unable to detect websites that take users to a completely unrelated page.<p>Original Google Result [0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abb-renovation.com&#x2F;csep&#x2F;kitty-keybindings.html\nWebsite that it actually takes you to [1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop1.onlinefactory2022.ru&#x2F;category?name=marcas%20de%20vestidos%20de%20coctel\nGoogle cache of result [2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webcache.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;search?q=cache:6f6lnaOYGPEJ:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abb-renovation.com&#x2F;csep&#x2F;kitty-keybindings.html+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us\nRedirect site I tried [3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redirectdetective.com&#x2F;",
