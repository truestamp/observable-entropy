      "text": "I want to show an early version of PickCode, a visual coding environment for students to use after they&#x27;ve learned Scratch. PickCode is designed for use on desktop and tablet, and supports creating chatbots, visual designs, and 2D games. There is plenty of functionality missing - you can&#x27;t add media to games for instance, but the current version shows off the foundation of what I&#x27;m aiming at.<p>As of now, there are sample programs to play with and an editor which saves your programs to local storage. Full user accounts, tutorials and administrator accounts for teachers to organize assignments are on their way soon. If you&#x27;re interested in using PickCode in a classroom or want to discuss feedback, send me an email at charlie@pickcode.io",
