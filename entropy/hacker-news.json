Since the processes involved were themselves tiny, startup and teardown costs were marginal, at least for some workloads.\nI believe one of the core ideas was that classic C&#x2F;Unix programmers thought in terms of &quot;shelling out&quot; to C when needed from a bash script but the core application logic was in the script and not in the (relatively) clunky language of C.<p>Anyway, if you know what blog post this is I would very much appreciate being pointed back to it. Hopefully others can benefit from finding things too!",
