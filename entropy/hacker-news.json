      "text": "I&#x27;m looking for a SaaS solution where I can send 10msgs a day per endpoint, but with &lt;1s latency to deliver.<p>I need the ad-hoc, independent queues to be trivially created based on a shared publisher&#x2F;consumer key and I don&#x27;t care about persistence - if a msg is not delivered immediately, it should be dropped. All endpoints are behind Nat, so some polling is required.<p>Is there a service that would help me here? SNS almost works, but creating&#x2F;restricting individual queues ad-hoc makes it more work than I want to deal with. Can something else provide a trivial &quot;send(secret, queue name, message)&quot; and &quot;listen(secret, queue)&quot; functionality?",

      "text": "I&#x27;d like to remove Google from my life as much as possible and the final step is to install an alternative OS onto my phone (either LineageOS or GrapheneOS). I&#x27;ve seen many suggestions to switch communication apps such as WhatsApp out for Signal, however I&#x27;ve not seen much discussion around banking apps. Many banks tend to have their own proprietary apps, with many important (verifying transactions&#x2F;login attempts, acting as &quot;security keys&quot;) and convenient (viewing transaction history quickly) features. I know some banks offer physical &quot;security keys&quot; which can replace the app but this does not apply to every bank, with some only offering their core services through the app and a stripped back version on web&#x2F;desktop.<p>Have you experienced anything similar? What have you done to get around this? If I can&#x27;t find an alternative method to access these utilities I&#x27;ll probably just bite the bullet and keep Google around for a little while longer (or until I can switch to a bank that offers a web-only experience - tangentially, are their any banks like this?).<p>Thank you for your time!",
