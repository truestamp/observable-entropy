      "text": "I&#x27;m curious if there are any technology based non-profits that are cater to direct consumers where their primary business is a website&#x2F;web business. The biggest one I can think of is Wikipedia; they are successful and have a very popular set of websites. Mozilla is another successful non-profit, but its primary business is not a website but a web application (Firefox). I&#x27;m not sure if Patreon is a non-profit or community benefit corporation. Do you know any others?",
