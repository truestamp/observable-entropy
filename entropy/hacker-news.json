I wanted to achieve the feeling that these libraries &quot;should be built into React&quot;.<p>Key features:<p>100% Typescript with state types deduction<p>Efficient and hook-based<p>With extra static access to core functionality (without hook)<p>No centralized providers (decentralized states and events)<p>Tiny - max 2.5kB<p>These libraries force, in my opinion, the cleanest way to design code architecture in React projects.<p>The libraries are production-ready and this week I introduced them to fresh React-Native commercial projects in my company. We will see them on the battlefield :)<p>BitAboutEvent: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bit-about&#x2F;event<p>BitAboutState: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bit-about&#x2F;state",
