      "text": "Hey folks!<p>I track time for 4 years already...<p>Usually, remote work isn&#x27;t demanding when for an engineer in a non-early stage startup. When you like your job and are excited about career growth, putting in extra hours can payout.<p>But for some folks working enough hours and doing something on the side could be a better strategy. When you think of time as an investment, you may distribute it properly between a day job, side projects, and hobbies.<p>How do you think of your time in the era of flexible work? Do you treat it as an investment, or do you go with a flow?<p>P.S.

      "text": "I&#x27;m a Swiss citizen, 38-years old. I&#x27;ve been based out of Southeast Asia for close to ten years. During this time, I&#x27;ve mostly survived on past savings and odd online jobs. However, for various reasons, I&#x27;m no longer able to stay here and have to return to Switzerland.\nI have little financial resources left, so I need a job fast. I will do anything within my capabilities. In the (distant) past, I worked in IT, but my tasks were mostly confined to simple code maintenance &amp; bug fixing. I also dabbled with Ruby on Rails during my free-time. That said, I didn&#x27;t touch code in several years. However, I would be totally willing to try and get back into it, even at minimal pay. I would also consider related jobs, like IT support or DevOps.\nIf anyone has any pointers or tips, that would be greatly appreciated!\nThanks\nSteve",
