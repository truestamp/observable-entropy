      "text": "I&#x27;m on a quest to decouple my online&#x2F;digital presence from my actual person as much as possible.<p>I&#x27;ve started using Qubes OS on an old Dell laptop for my daily computation needs. Email is a lost cause since most of my traffic will pass through google&#x2F;MS at one point. Started using password managers and throwaways etc but I still haven&#x27;t figured out a sane way of reaping the benefits of having a smartphone without compromising my security&#x2F;privacy.<p>I was thinking of Apple despite their business practices but I have soured on them with the last debate and probably it wasn&#x27;t a very good idea from the start anyways due to lack of control on the hardware. Have alternative OSs (Calyx, Sailfish, Lineage or mobile linux distros) for android hardware reached maturity? Is it even possible to have closed source hardware not spy on you? Is my best bet buying a nokia 3310 and just listening to music on an mp3 player?<p>Let me know what solutions you use to keep your privacy.",
