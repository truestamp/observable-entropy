      "text": "Generally in media, FOMO refers to person missing important information about important incidents, occasions related to friends and relatives(ex: parties, firstborn of your sister). I am okay with that, I do not like Facebook culture much.<p>But I am interested about scientific, technical, dev related news like new libraries &#x2F; products &#x2F; research articles. I have FOMO for those things. I want to stay updated about those things, since those new things(libraries, products) can help me to save time in my work. I mostly use HN, Reddit to get news, updates. But I cannot keep watching those platforms for every day since my ADHD loves stimulating things and I keep running into rabbit holes where I do nothing for the rest of the day. I was thinking about only visiting those platforms once month, but a lot of content have gathered during the month and I may have a lot of  missing things too.<p>I know new libraries &#x2F; products &#x2F; research may get outdated, discontinued, invalidated quickly, but there can be things that last a while which I may be interested. Furthermore, I know with information is exploding on the platforms I mentioned and no one will be able to keep update about every thing and most info are of poor quality. What I want is to keep up to date about the domains I am interested on those platforms.<p>Currently, I use RSS feeds to keep up-to-date with things I am interested, but I have no solution for platform like HN, Reddit (I know there is RSS for those platforms, but they are not smart enough to recommend what I am interested) Is there any solution for this?<p>Or are there any practical tips to tackle this FOMO issue?<p>Or should I accept that I will miss things, it is okay, check those platforms when I can?<p>Any advice highly appreciated!",

When the very public accounts of the terrible culture started to come out, I remember hearing&#x2F;reading about the damage to existing employees should they decide to go work elsewhere.<p>Is this still the case for Uber employees?  Ultimately, I&#x27;m trying to decide what the long-term costs will be if I decide to take this mediocre offer now vs. start interviewing at more reputable companies (weighing the bird in the hand is worth 2 more in the bush yada yada...)",
