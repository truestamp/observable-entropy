I have experience with using static code analysis tools to identify and fix vulnerabilities found in the OWASP Top 10, and I&#x27;d like to make a transition into Application Security full-time because I&#x27;m really interested in this field.<p>I&#x27;ve had a few AppSec interviews but most of the time my job applications are ignored. At my current job I don&#x27;t have the opportunity to work on anything security related and I&#x27;m not sure what I can do to gain more security skills and make my resume marketable for AppSec roles, not just SWE. Of course I&#x27;ve been taking Udemy classes and watching YouTube videos on OWASP vulnerabilities but it seems silly to put on my resume that I merely took some classes.<p>I&#x27;m located in the Bay Area but have also been applying to remote roles.",
