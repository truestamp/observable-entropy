      "text": "In my opinion Plaid is one of the worst things to ever happen to individual data &amp; financial security. Beyond creating the single greatest target for attacks it goes against one of the most fundamental rules: never share username &amp; password with anyone.<p>Handing your password over to Plaid gives them every bit of data accessible from your bank&#x27;s web account. They can get as much information in the time it takes to screen scrape your account as the credit bureaus have collected on you in years. Their TOS lets them get everything available as far back as your bank will let them go and does not contain any financial guarantee whatsoever for when they are inevitably hacked.<p>But now apps are being approved that use Plaid without even confirming to the user that they are talking to Plaid because it&#x27;s all being done in-app! No one can tell if they are sending their bank login (username, passsword, sometimes security questions &#x2F; answers &amp; one-time-passwords) to Plaid or a random third party because it happens outside of a browser.<p>Why is Apple approving apps that use Plaid?",
