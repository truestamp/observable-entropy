      "text": "Hello HN!<p>Here is a little game I made, colorful tiles must be placed next to other tiles and match in symbol or color.\nThis game is inspired by Passage 3 and similar games like Qwirkle, Rummy or Dominoes.\nThere exist some browser-based versions here and there, but I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with any of them, so I made my own.\nThis is optimized for a broad range of screen sizes and auto-rotates the playing field for narrow (portrait) viewports.\nAs I&#x27;ve discovered with my own parents, folks who enjoy playing Solitaire, Hearts and similar games might enjoy this as well, so gladly spread the word.<p>Have fun and feedback is appreciated! :)",
