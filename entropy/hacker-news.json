      "text": "Hello HN,<p>Wondering what people with almost no distribution channel manage to validate their ideas!<p>I&#x27;ve built and published many apps throughout school without validating the idea, but they received 20K+ installs in a short span.<p>After reading tons of books and articles, I realized people validate their ideas before spending too much time on them.<p>So I decided to build a landing page with a waitlist for my product and posted it on Twitter and Instagram.<p>Though a lot of people I spoke to sounded &quot;excited&quot;, I got very few signups. \n(They&#x27;re not my target audience, so I didn&#x27;t ask them if they&#x27;d pay for such a product)<p>Now I&#x27;m wondering if my idea is bad or if my distribution is awful.<p>What am I doing wrong?<p>(P.S I&#x27;m working on a creator SaaS product)",
