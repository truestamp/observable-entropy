      "text": "Hi everyone,<p>I have been working with AWS with many years and the service over the years has been outstanding. A few months ago I started the migration of (yet another business) to AWS, and we had an incident. This made me think that maybe AWS is starting not to be good any more.<p>I would like to share the postmortem report with the community, and please comment on what you think. I would like to know if we made a fundamental mistake or if AWS is actually degrading.<p>Times are UTC. Personal opinions are removed from the report, just facts are stated.<p>----------\nPOSTMORTEM REPORT<p>The project consists on moving several services to AWS. The system consists  Services in 1 autoscaling group, and a PostgreSQL Database in RDS.<p>- Sunday 4.30 am: we migrate the PostgreSQL database to RDS. RDS is configured with 200 GB in the disk, the database size is 15 GB.<p>- Sunday 10.17 am: RDS detects that we are running out of space, and decides to grow the database from 200 GB to 999 GB. The RDS auto scaling event starts<p>At this point the performance if the database is degraded. Alerts are triggered.<p>A test performed from the VPC network with the query &quot;SELECT now()&quot; took 20 seconds and 248 milliseconds.<p>The database performance is that bad that many of the services goes down.<p>- The RDS auto scaling event finalized at 14:39.<p>After contacting with AWS Support (see details below) we decided to roll back.<p>We contacted with AWS Support (Business). The points more important in the transcript are:<p>- The fact that RDS decided to grow the disk from 200 GB to 999 GB, when the actual database size is 15 GB, it is not a problem.<p>- In the actual auto-scaling event a performance degradation while the auto scaling event is operational is expected. As &quot;sessions&quot;(1) are not being drop, from AWS the database is considered online so it is working as per expectations.<p>- Pointed out the example of a SELECT now() taking 20 seconds. This did not change the fact that the database is online and all is good.<p>- When asked for an estimation of the duration of the event, it was stated that could take &quot;from several minutes to several days&quot;.<p>- The objective of AWS Support is to communicate what is happening (implies that you should not expect them to help you to fix the actual problem)<p>-------<p>Opinions ?",
