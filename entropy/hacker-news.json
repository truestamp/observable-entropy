This is what I compressed:<p>- MacOS: FileVault2<p>- Linux (which I don&#x27;t have): luks&#x2F; dm-crypt<p>- Windows: Bitlocker<p>- Hard drives: VeraCrypt (TrueCrypt back then)<p>Is this fine these days? Are there other, better (and user-friendly) options?<p>Protecting myself against three letters or anything is not the requirement here. I want my diary, notes, pictures, etc. safe from people (not institutions).<p>[1] Ask HN: How do you encrypt your laptops?
