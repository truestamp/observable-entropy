I.e. purely a function of upvotes and time?<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that almost all the stories that mention the invasion of Ukraine seem to be quickly dropped from the front page even though they have a great many votes, and I&#x27;d like to still be able to see them.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is people trying to avoid politics somehow, or people with ties to Russia who are trying to avoid the war being so visible.<p>I really value the unique perspective of the HN community and am sad to see it so easily stifled when it seems clear that this is subject of great interest to many hackers with many topics where the war overlaps with technology and business.",
