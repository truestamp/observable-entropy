They even correctly identify my company when I visit them from my home desktop. How do they get this information?<p>They say their algorithm works to identify and validate matches, based on Clearbit&#x27;s processing and application of machine learning to hundreds of millions of new data points each month, along with multiple signals from traffic patterns, geolocation, manual QA and more. (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clearbit.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;ip-intelligence-for-remote-work). \nI really struggle to come up with what these data points are.<p>Anyone else have any ideas?",
