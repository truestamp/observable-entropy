      "text": "I have never really had a good memory - short term or long term. My working memory is pretty good, but that&#x27;s about it. I have always envied people who have the ability to remember a relevant quote&#x2F;figure or recalled the reference to a book&#x2F;film&#x2F;tv show etc in conversation. I read frequently but struggle to remember the characters names and plot points. I watch films&#x2F;TV shows and struggle to describe the plot a day or two later.<p>Is there anything I can do to improve this type of memory or is this just a reality of my mind? How do people of HN remember things? Any particular tools, techniques or resources used?",
