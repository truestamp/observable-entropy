      "text": "I&#x27;m not serious about learning Hindi, but I need to mix it up a bit with my neverending job search.<p>Any sites other than Duolingo?<p>I was kind of hoping someone tried something really new and interesting -- the kind of thing you could make if you didn&#x27;t have to worry about selling it immediately, or ever.<p>Weird snafu with Duo that prompted me to post this now instead of a few minutes from now -- parts of the first lesson had me thinking I was going crazy -- the letter shown on the screen would be a &#x27;ka&#x27; or &#x27;kha&#x27;, but the sound associated with it would be a &#x27;ga&#x27; or &#x27;gha&#x27; (and vice-versa).<p>The app actually speaks it to you automatically in some cases, and you can click the little audio button to hear it again -- which was good in this case, because &#x27;ga&#x27; and &#x27;ka&#x27; (and &#x27;gha&#x27; and &#x27;kha&#x27;) are pretty darn similar if you&#x27;re not hearing it in context, or if you don&#x27;t now Hindi.<p>It&#x27;s the very first lesson, and multiple questions. It makes me think Uber is entering the language learning game and doing some more sabotage.",
