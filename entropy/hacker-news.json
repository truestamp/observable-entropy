      "text": "Pre-covid, I was traveling full time to teach ReactJS to corporate clients. My students (mostly developers at banks and insurance companies) would ask me &#x27;What&#x27;s a good React book?&#x27; and I would struggle to recommend something, knowing that all the books sucked or were really out of date. When all my face-to-face training work dried up and I really didn&#x27;t want to do online training, I magically got a contract to write a book.<p>I started by reading all of the best-selling books on React, and, yeah, they were all really out of date, incomplete, or just wrong.<p>As I started writing what I hoped would be a really good React book, I also wanted the website to be something useful and a notch above a typical book website. So, I tried to have working examples of the code listings on the site and to organize them in a way that would make them useful for when I started teaching again, or for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to buy a book and just wants to see how things are done.<p>The book just came out today! The website isn&#x27;t perfect or done, but here it is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactjsfoundations.com .<p>How&#x27;d I do?",
