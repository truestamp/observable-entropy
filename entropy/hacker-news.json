      "text": "I recently read the (rather excellent) Murderbot Diaries series and realized that it isn&#x27;t just social interactions that tend to assume that people are extroverts, but that most fiction does too.<p>I recall reading as a kid any number of mystery stories where the protagonist was shut-in for some reason (agoraphobia, for example), and misanthropes abound in anything with a hint of noir, but introverts per-se seem to be rare (which strikes me as odd, since authors are often introverts).<p>So, any recommendations? I&#x27;m personally interested in science fiction and fantasy, but mysteries or (techno)thrillers will do as well. Not really into horror, but don&#x27;t let that stop you, I&#x27;m sure others here will be interested.",
