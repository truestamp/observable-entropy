      "text": "Writing is easy to the extent that you are interested in what you are writing about.\nMost of the challenges with writing stems from the *process of writing no the writing itself.*\nTypical challenges consist of the following\n* Figuring out what to write about\n* The stress of sitting down and typing a thousand words in to your computer\n* How good is this content for your target audience\n* Overcoming obstacles such as writer&#x27;s block\n* And so on.\nThese are some of the challenges. The goodnews is that *with the new improvements in technology such as artificial intelligence, writing today is so much more easy than it has ever been in history.<p>Artificially intelligent systems has made it incredibly easy as a content creator to manifest your creativity more fully without barriers.\nThe former walls that the great writers of the past had to deal with has been overcome by AI.<p>The issue with these systems is that they are expensive and require significant investment.<p>There are others that are free and very easy to use.
