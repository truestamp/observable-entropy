      "text": "Hello, my name is Marwan. I am glad to show you what my team were working on during the past year. TowerBI is a simple programmable business intelligence tool that gives you a platform to build data collectors on, monitors store, and a simple way to represent the data.\nIt all started out of our frustration with current BI tools. You will notice (after the store gets more monitors) how simple the monitors are, and how not using charts (yes, no charts) is better most of the time.<p>Right now, there is no way to connect to databases, only monitors that get their data using HTTP, and monitors that use data collectors (docker containers) can be developed.<p>We hope we start to develop more monitors with you and build the next generation of BI tools.<p>Happy to answer your question if you have any.",
