      "text": "I&#x27;m currently building software that I would like to see turned into a business. However, there is plenty of evidence that companies will not pay for what software they use until they realize that there is a problem, such as log4j, OpenSSL, and probably plenty others.<p>Then there are the cases where companies are outright violating licenses such as the violations of the GPL with regards to OBS Studio by TikTok, among others.<p>And then, of course, Copilot might be used to launder code.<p>That leaves me with the impression that companies will not pay if they can get away with it, and getting away with it might even include breaking the law since the little guy does not have resources to sue.<p>However, there seems to be a glimmer of hope: copyleft licenses with the option for companies to purchase a commercial license. (This is an option for me because I&#x27;m writing the code from scratch.) Based on some previous comments (like [1]), it seems that even this may not work, which would be sad. But I thought I would ask before I throw in the towel.<p>So I would like to hear your thoughts and experiences about using copyleft with commercial licenses.<p>Does it work? Do companies pay?<p>By the way, by &quot;effective,&quot; I don&#x27;t mean that <i>every</i> company follows the license. All I want is for just enough of them to purchase a license and&#x2F;or support to pay 2 times the typical developer salary. (I need 2 times the salary for tax purposes.)<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29524103",
