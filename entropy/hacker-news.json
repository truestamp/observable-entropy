I’m targeting small business owners and going out to talk to people is hell for me. My heart races, I speak in a low voice, have an awkward grin and my attempts to talk to people has been a disaster - most people find me uninteresting and want to just go on with their work.<p>I also have ADD, so I’ve to or feel like I’ve to try very hard to listen and which makes it very difficult to think on my feet and ask meaningful questions or make the conversation interesting. I’ve taken the usual medication for ADD, but those make my anxiety worse. I’ve been on some kind of anti depressant for the last 18 years.<p>Can you give me some tips and or something from your personal experience to overcome this issue. Getting a co-founder is not a viable option for me as I don’t have that big of a friend circle.<p>Thanks for reading!<p>Edit: changed some wording",
