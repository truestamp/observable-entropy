      "text": "Hi Hacker News!<p>It&#x27;s safe to say that we all enjoy some quality apps on our phones. But guess what, there&#x27;s a certain industry that&#x27;s still clinging to the usability and security standards from the desktop era of the 2010s. Poorly designed UIs, bombardments of ads, random popups, scams, etc. This industry operates in such a shady way that we as users rather keep their products in incognito mode.<p>We say no more and offer you the following solution:<p>USER EXPERIENCE<p>- Mobile first and native-like UI design.\n- Beautiful dark mode that&#x27;s easy on your eyes.\n- Instant navigations, smooth scrolling, touch gestures.\n- Can be added to the home screen for fullscreen and quick access (PWA).\n- No annoying ads and popups.<p>PRIVACY PROTECTION<p>- All data is stored locally in browser storage. No personal information is sent to servers.\n- All functionality is available without sign up or other personal identification.\n- No Google Analytics. Instead, we use the privacy-focused Fathom Analytics (usefathom.com).\n- No URL paths that expose information in the browsing history. Forward&#x2F;back navigation still works perfectly.<p>INCLUSIVITY<p>- Only personal (and verified) accounts allowed. No studios or brands. This means that all available content has been approved by their actors and was created consensually. - We welcome all types of sexual orientation and try to provide the best possible service to all of our users.<p>Please note that this product is only intended for persons over the age of 18.<p>Happy swiping!",

We’re super excited to officially launch PSPDFKit API [1].<p>PSPDFKit API is a collection of HTTP APIs that enable you to convert, generate, and edit documents without running any service on your infrastructure.<p>What differentiates our API from others is that you can chain together multiple “actions” as part of a single API request. For example, you can convert, OCR, watermark, edit, and flatten a document — all in one call.<p>Available actions [2]:<p>- PDF Generator<p>- PDF Converter<p>- Image Converter<p>- OCR<p>- Watermark<p>- Merge<p>- Split<p>- Duplicate<p>- Delete<p>- Flatten<p>Our documentation includes sample code for JavaScript [3], Python [4], Java [5], C# [6], PHP [7], and the command line.
