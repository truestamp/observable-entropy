The list of things I have failed at my entire life is monstrous.<p>I have failed my way to amazing engineering jobs and then failed out. Either by way of being managed out or by leaving before things got too bad.<p>There was a time when I was fine with this. But now, with a family, I am having some real regrets. I have trained myself to be OK with procrastination in the moment. Always ready to be angry at myself afterword.<p>I am now so self-critical that I get caught in worry loops that keep me doing nothing productive.<p>I started seeing a therapist but it’s just embarrassing to fully say how I feel things are going and how deep this dysfunction actually goes. At this point my therapist is like a paid buddy who hears me vent. He offers many solutions I try but never stick to.<p>I need to break this cycle and I need ideas.",
