      "text": "I run an API SaaS business, where most use-cases you&#x27;d use our API for involve making a fairly-large number of API requests.<p>For business reasons, we don&#x27;t yet have any paid plans (nor any of the infrastructure to support paid plans); so right now we&#x27;re only giving our users access to a <i>rate-limited</i> free plan.<p>For the vast majority of our users, they can build and scale their use-case while staying well under the rate limits our free plan imposes.<p>But some of our users find our rate-limits constraining, and try to evade them by registering additional accounts, to then use multiple API keys in tandem to make their requests. (These users&#x27; apps are usually badly-architected, such that they&#x27;re making 10-100x the number of requests they should be to achieve their use-case.)<p>Deactivating these users&#x27; &quot;alt&quot; accounts as we find them — or even banning these users altogether — doesn&#x27;t help much, as these users just move on to using increasingly &quot;stealthy&quot; account registrations — using real-seeming email providers; registering through VPNs to disguise their traffic origin; splitting their requests by microservice such that their backend IPs&#x2F;request-signatures never correlate; etc.<p>We <i>could</i> force users to go through a KYC&#x2F;AML-like identity-verification process to register, but this would be a pretty massive hurdle to impose in the way of signing up for a SaaS product — and not one our users would expect, given that we&#x27;re not a finance or gambling app.<p>Is there any other way?<p>Have you scaled an API SaaS with a free-tier plan and dealt with this problem? If so, what did you do?",
