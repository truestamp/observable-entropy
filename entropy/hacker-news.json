I&#x27;m not offering to solve specific programming questions, I&#x27;m offering to provide guidance on what to study and how to prepare!<p>Discord invite link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;M8944Xz26m<p>Feel free to share the link with anyone who would benefit.<p>## My Story<p>After 3 consecutive years of Google&#x2F;FB interviews, I finally received offers from Google, FB &amp; others.<p>When I was at FB, I conducted a lot of interviews and I even taught a class around programming interviews to my friends! Those friends are now at Google, Amazon, WeWork &amp; smaller tech companies.<p>I want to help others avoid the mistakes I made and that I&#x27;m constantly seeing others make!",
