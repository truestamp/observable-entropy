      "text": "*Yet Another Gmail Workspaces Alternatives Post<p>I know alternatives to Google Workspaces have been discussed to death recently. And, after looking at a few of the options mentioned in other threads, I&#x27;m leaning towards inbox.eu. They seem to offer the most competitive price for the modest needs I have [Custom domain. Handful of addresses for family members. Not bothered about any of the usual &#x27;businessy&#x27; stuff].<p>Searching HN, I only find user &#x27;malinens&#x27; with much to say about inbox.eu and s&#x2F;he seems to be involved with the company, so likely not entirely unbiased. Searching further afield, &#x27;malinens&#x27; shows up again in most of the positive mentions of inbox.eu I find online.  And all the negative reviews seem to be the same one copy&#x2F;pasted to everywhere inbox.eu is mentioned and presumably by another single individual.<p>So, between those two extremes, it would be nice to find some unbiased opinions from people without a personal axe to grind. So, as the title says; Anyone Using inbox.eu? And, if so, how are you finding it? Also, how much hassle was importing your mail from Google?",
