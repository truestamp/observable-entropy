      "text": "These are glasses that filter blue light from a computer screen. These are purported to reduce fatigue and strain when using computer screens for long periods.<p>There are also &#x27;sleep&#x27; glasses that filter out some of the colour spectrum (in preparation for going to bed).<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me why you would need both? Are they a way to sell more glasses variations, or a genuine difference?<p>Are these glasses based on sound science? Or are they pseudo-science?<p>The cost of these glasses vary wildly from cheap (cheap quality?) no-name products to more expensive brands.<p>BLUblox is one such &#x27;brand&#x27;. They sell glasses for computer use, they sell &quot;mood booster glasses that contain a light-yellow lens&quot; for depression and anxiety. And finally, they sell glasses for a good night&#x27;s sleep that &quot;block blue and green light after dark with red lens&quot;.<p>Have you used blue-light filtering glasses for computer use? Did you find them helpful? Any brand you recommend?<p>Similarly, have you used &#x27;sleep&#x27; glasses designed to help you prepare for sleep?",
