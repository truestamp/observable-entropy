      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m a Software Engineer, looking for ways to contribute to Academic Research. I remember reading on HN how academic researchers struggle to compile and process their research data because of programming challenges. I&#x27;m thinking of creating a platform to connect such researchers and programmers to each other, in addition to helping some of these researchers myself.<p>I wanted to ask the broader community to see if any of y&#x27;all know any platforms that already do this. Or whether you know someone who might be interested in using this platform, either as researcher or programmer so I may work with them re this.<p>Thanks!",
