I’d guess my total comp would be closer to $80&#x2F;hr if I added everything together.<p>In the past I’ve found clients on Upwork but it was pretty terrible and the clients were cheap.<p>I tried going on Arc and got verified, etc. but they only ever send full time jobs.<p>Does anyone have advice on finding part time freelance jobs at a decent rate, like $120+&#x2F;hr?<p>I’m a US citizen, live in the US, etc. Full stack Python&#x2F;Node&#x2F;PHP dev so there should be plenty of demand…",
