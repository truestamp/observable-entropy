      "text": "I would love something like a single text file spec&#x2F;yaml file where you specify the knowledge ‘services’ your team uses. Eg:<p>gdrive:\n  folders:\n    - eng\n    - notion-sync \n      - symlink: notion&#x2F;notion-sync<p>notion:\n  workspaces:\n    - notion-sync:\n      permissions: allow-all<p>slack:\n  integrations:\n    - gdrive<p>Something to that effect. Do docker-compose type configs exist to put all these things together?<p>The real value-add would be being able to expose this information in a processible way, eg allowing documents that can retrieve information from within other sources of knowledge (as well as keeping copies of prev state)<p>Why? Because what if today I have all these sketches of proofs or diagrams or things that don’t really map onto any feature that currently exists in these existing apps, but in a few years some awesome app just for this use-case emerges. I would like to continue sketching w the hope that in the future the work I’ve already done is likely to eventually become integrated into the existing meta-level system.<p>There may be a lot of forgotten&#x2F;lost&#x2F;never-pursued knowledge that could eventually become extremely useful to a different person; simply because the conduits to create that expectation of the eventual free-flow of any medium of knowledge didn&#x27;t exist at the time.",
