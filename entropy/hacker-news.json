      "text": "When I decided to make my portfolio, I started by looking at other developers&#x27; portfolios. I saw many fancy websites, with animations and cool visualisations. But one thing always bothered me. Even after viewing the site, I still had no idea who that person was and what their personality was like. \nI find that a crucial part of a portfolio website. It is important too So when I made my own, I wrote a detailed description for every featured project, some general sentences about me, why I code, how I learn to code, what my ambitions are, and what I am currently working on. On Twitter I got great feedback for this approach. In case you want to take a look at my portfolio, you can find it under:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hendel.vercel.app&#x2F;",
