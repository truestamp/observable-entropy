      "text": "I am interested in so many things that I can never dedicate enough time to just one hobby to get really good at it. Only solution I see is that if I dedicate my free time to just one hobby for next few years until I turn it into business. Then I can quit my job and work on other hobbies while earning money from my business.<p>I don&#x27;t hate jobs, programming is my hobby too, but I hate deadlines and meetings that I cannot decline.<p>So I am thinking of turning one of following casual hobbies into serious hobby.<p>1. Writing fiction<p>2. Blogging outdoors lifestyle<p>3. Photography - outdoors, underwater focused<p>4. Making and remixing music<p>5. Building webapps - too similar to work but highest likelihood of success<p>6. ???<p>What do you think?",
