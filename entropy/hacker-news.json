      "text": "I&#x27;m starting a junior position at a company where I have interned at for the last year. I&#x27;ve requested for a work-machine, but was offered an older, weaker alternative than my personal MacBook (base model, 2015).<p>As a result, I&#x27;ve moved my development to a cloud environment so that it would lift some computing load. This, however, is not possible for graphical demanding programs such as Figma.<p>In the past year, I repeatedly had to work from home to compensate for my machine&#x27;s shortcomings with my desktop. The company has now warned me not to work from home again.<p>What is the proper way to ask for a work-machine? \nWhat is the best course of action if the request is rejected again? \nDoes it make sense to take out a loan to buy one myself?",
