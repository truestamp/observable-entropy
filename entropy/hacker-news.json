      "text": "TL;DR: <i>Consider listing your contact details in your HN profile!</i><p>There are lots of interesting conversations happening here on HN. But sometimes people might want to continue the discussions even after threads fall of the front page.<p>Have you considered listing your contact details on HN so that people can get in touch with you more easily?<p>If you want to do that, please note that it’s <i>not</i> enough to fill in the email field on your profile. <i>Only</i> the HN admins can see that field.<p>If you want others to see your e-mail address etc, you need to explicitly put it in the <i>about</i> text area.<p>Some members want to keep a low profile and I certainly respect that. But please consider what you might be missing. There’s also no requirement to use your main e-mail address. One could also use an alternative e-mail in order to stay pseudonymous.<p>There are just so many interesting people here so I thought that one might not want to miss out on all interesting connections that could occur. For example, interesting job offers are not uncommon here.<p>Just my ¢2 though, do what thou wilt. Peace!",
