I wrote this to auth against Cognito back when the Amplify packages were adding 1.7MB to the bundle size.<p>I just noticed that somebody copied the files from my repo into a new repo, destroying all the git history. This person then added a LICENSE file claiming copyright over all the files.<p>My repo lacks a LICENSE file but it is marked as MIT on the GitHub project page. I would assume the person can&#x27;t claim license over all of my work like that. For jurisdictions: the person appears to live in Norway while I live in New Zealand.<p>I sent them an email and haven&#x27;t heard back yet. What should I do?",
