      "text": "When I&#x27;m trying to get familiar with a new codebase it often takes me a long time to build a proper mental model of the whole system. Even with my own projects, it&#x27;s easy to lose track of all the components and their interactions since they&#x27;re constantly changing, and making hand-drawn diagrams is time consuming.<p>So my questions are:<p>- Why isn&#x27;t diagram generation automated as part of the build process (UML or otherwise)?<p>- Why aren&#x27;t code visualization tools more popular? The options out there seem outdated<p>- Would you want to use these tools? What would be your ideal tool?",
