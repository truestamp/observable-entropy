      "text": "I want to order different groceries. I don&#x27;t want to research various diets or ingredients for seasonal recipes, the reason I don&#x27;t want to is because I won&#x27;t and will instead just get things similar to the prior things I&#x27;ve ordered, which is adequate.<p>From talking with people, who seem to get a joy out of doing this stuff, my experience is seen as absurd and invalid, I see it is as underserviced.<p>Is there a service that lets me autopopulate a grocery list for delivery based on a trending or social recommendation?<p>I want to look at NYT Cooking and have a grocery list that will use one of my local food delivery apps and choose the most similar food item.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> someone&#x27;s startup that I have to sign up for that doesn&#x27;t really do this and doesn&#x27;t cause delivery from the places that Prime&#x2F;Instacard&#x2F;Walmart do. But I am open to knowing about them and the people working on this underserved market, because I get the impression it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Apps I&#x27;ve seen that have any sort of grocery list sharing are limited to your contacts or imagining that its for a family. Its still a &quot;make your own list first&quot; experience and assumption. I want a &quot;here&#x27;s what other people are buying list, buy now&quot; experience.<p>I&#x27;m fine with paying a premium for this.<p>What services have you all seen?",
