      "text": "I just happened to be consulting the website for APOPO, www.apopo.org &quot;global leader in scent detection animals&quot; (founded by Bart Weetjens in 1995), entity which trains rats to detect landmines by smelling TNT - «The rats can smell TNT in low concentrations and even when it&#x27;s buried under the ground (up to 15-20 cm)... from a distance of about 1 meter».<p>As I read that «APOPO’s HeroRATs take around nine months to fully train», the preliminary thought struck, about whether cybernetic deminers, for which training is an &quot;upload&quot;, can be worth considering. Maybe the time to build a robot and its costs are competitive. It seems that the more complex part could really be the motility - the landmine sensor may not be something you train, if the revealing substance remains TNT, or the problem seems to remain deterministic, if achieving a database of all the diverse threats is a goal. On the other hand, other techniques that involve e.g. visual clues and other open factors for decision may enhance the results, and call again for dynamic &quot;training&quot;.<p>Also note that the inspiring entity seems to use automation already in their processes: rats can use automated training rooms (they are rewarded for TNT detection).<p>I find the matter interesting and &quot;important&quot; as an understatement, and maybe some good result could come from opening the topic.",
