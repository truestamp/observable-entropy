      "text": "I tend to think that most of us are not good at telepathy. From here it follows that if you want something, then you should speak about it out loud and if you REALLY WANT then speak out loud and in general to everyone. This increases the chances of getting what you want.<p>This idea is so simple that it seems banal. In the meantime, each of us has people around us who want to get something from you but forgot to tell you about it, so you don’t do this, so they’re pouting themselves  and maybe you are pouting at someone because you think that &quot;It’s clear and understandable that I want this! Does he not understand? It’s obvious.&quot; So it happens in relationships and business. Today is about the last one.<p>Joe regularly records episodes for his The Hustle and Flowchart Podcast, so he is looking for interesting conversations. He collected his Dream 100 sheet. A regular google sheet in which he wrote down 100 names of people with whom he wants to meet and invite to his show in one column. There, among the names, for example, Bezos and Buffett. To increase his chances, Joe adds a link to the sheet at the end of all his emails with the text &quot;My Dream Sheet 100. Do you know anyone?&quot;<p>In this case, I love that Joe turned it into a system that does not depend on his condition and mood. I&#x27;ve been writing 3-5 letters every day. About a hundred letters to people from different parts of the world and fields of activity per month. The chance that someone knows someone on the list is increasing every day. Mindblowing!<p>What other requests can be made like this?  Are you doing something similar for your startup or business? Let us know in the comments!",
