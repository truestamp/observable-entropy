They know a little HTML, but are overwise they&#x27;re complete beginners.<p>Can anyone recommend a course (free or paid) which can help introduce the basics of HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JavaScript alongside React? Or would it be better to focus on HTML, CSS &amp; vanilla JavaScript first?<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this so long I&#x27;m not sure I appreciate how difficult it might be for sometime to jump straight into React. Has anyone got children or family members who were able to pick up React without first learning HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript?",
