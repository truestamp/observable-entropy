      "text": "Hey HN, I often remember bits of either Hacker News&#x27; threads or links I&#x27;ve followed from them that I then neglect to bookmark.<p>I suspect others have the same issue and wanted to make a thread to hopefully connect the resident knowledge-base of people here to those in need.<p>In my case, I&#x27;m cursed looking for a particular blog post in which the author demonstrated a technique for coding complex software in C via leveraging the shell (bash in this case) as a way of avoiding memory management issues. Since the processes involved were themselves tiny, startup and teardown costs were marginal, at least for some workloads.\nI believe one of the core ideas was that classic C&#x2F;Unix programmers thought in terms of &quot;shelling out&quot; to C when needed from a bash script but the core application logic was in the script and not in the (relatively) clunky language of C.<p>Anyway, if you know what blog post this is I would very much appreciate being pointed back to it. Hopefully others can benefit from finding things too!",
