      "text": "I recently received unsolicited mail from a company (I&#x27;m in the US, and the company is also in the US) advertising their service.<p>I don&#x27;t recall ever giving this company my name or address, so I contacted them and asked them to please let me know where they got my information from. They have not responded to multiple requests, so my question is: is there any legal action I can take to compel the company to reveal how they obtained my name and address?<p>It struck me that, while there are now numerous consumer protection laws around the country (and the world) which can require companies to reveal what information they have about you, or to delete your information, are there any laws anywhere which can compel a company to reveal <i>how</i> it obtained your information?",
