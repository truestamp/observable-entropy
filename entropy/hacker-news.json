      "text": "I noticed earlier that ping (mine is from iputils [0]) calls bind():<p><pre><code>    rascul@smarts:~&gt; strace -fe bind ping -c1 google.com &gt; &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null\n    bind(5, {sa_family=AF_NETLINK, nl_pid=0, nl_groups=00000000}, 12) = 0\n    +++ exited with 0 +++\n</code></pre>\nThis confused me, because I didn&#x27;t understand why ping needed to bind(). I understood ping to send an ICMP echo request and time the reply [1]. I wasn&#x27;t sure why ping needed to act as a server for this. This appears to be Netlink related, according to the sa_family in the bind() call.<p>I asked about this on IRC, the #linux [2] channel on Libera [3]. Several people helped do some digging, and it looks like it might come from a getaddrinfo() call, but we weren&#x27;t able to verify that. We noticed that bind() isn&#x27;t called for some hosts:<p><pre><code>    rascul@smarts:~&gt; strace -fe bind ping -c1 kernel.org &gt; &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null\n    +++ exited with 0 +++\n</code></pre>\nNor is bind() called for ip addresses:<p><pre><code>    rascul@smarts:~&gt; strace -fe bind ping -c1 9.9.9.9 &gt; &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null\n    +++ exited with 0 +++\n</code></pre>\nI wasn&#x27;t able to test it at the time, but I was informed that ping from busybox sometimes calls bind() also.<p>I don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s any security implications involved, but mostly I&#x27;m just curious, why does ping call bind()? It would be great if anyone was able to help shed some light on this.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;iputils&#x2F;iputils&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;ping&#x2F;ping.c<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_Control_Message_Protocol<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linux.chat&#x2F;linux-on-libera&#x2F;<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;libera.chat&#x2F;",
