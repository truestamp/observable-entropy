During that time I&#x27;ve accrued a decent amount of technical and domain knowledge about our system, enough that they&#x27;ve placed me as a technical architect working with two teams for an upcoming release whose deadline is about a year from now. Given most of HN consists of tech-oriented folks, I was hoping to get some advice on how to thrive in this new role both from a technical and leadership standpoint, as I feel I am still getting my footing in adjusting to this sudden change.",
