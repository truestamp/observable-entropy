      "text": "Hi Hacker News! I&#x27;m Oscar!<p>I do a lot of react native and web development, therefore I mostly code in JavaScript, however some of the new technologies coming up such as web assembly and the react-native JSI require knowledge of low level languages.<p>In order to leverage this new tech I had to learn C++ and it was not an easy path, a lot of the documentation and knowledge out there is way too hard or in depth for my purposes, I just want to use C++ as fast as I can to achieve my own goals.<p>Therefore I want to make the path easier for other developers, in just a couple of hours I&#x27;m trying to cover the most interesting parts of C++, the 20% that will allow you to achieve 80% of what is possible.  Course is completely free, hosted on youtube, if you like it I would ask you to subscribe or to follow me on twitter! feedback is of course welcome!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YOsCv4_vMgo&amp;list=PLanS_SVm5swgrFrqo-NTITZxud4KRmZgB",

      "text": "I consider myself to be pretty switched on when it comes to privacy, although I’ve began caring less and less as my attention is spent on other things…\nMaybe I slipped to far, because last night I was browsing a website looking for a Human Machine Interface from 4d systems (a relatively niche product)\nToday, it’s the first ad that appears on Instagram. Any idea how it got there?<p>1. Searched for it via DuckDuckGo, in safari on OS X. (Signed into Instagram on that browser, and fake Facebook account which shares no info with said Instagram. Fake facebook account signed in on same iPhone as Instagram.\n2. Instagram and fake Facebook settings have fully disabled all tracking and ad personalisation settings that are possible.\n3. I actively engage ads I don’t care about, and often receive ads for COMPLETELY irrelevant things, I find this fun.<p>How did within a matter of hours this HMI end up on my Insta feed, I’m sure I’m missing something obvious… surely not cookies…<p>Someone shared, or bled data.\n4d systems webpage? Likely - but they don’t know anything about me… AdGuard and safari - couldn’t be a cookie?\nduckduckgo? Doubt it\nSafari? I thought safari blocked cross site tracking?",
