      "text": "Apple did not allow Flash on their devices for a long time, and the only way this problem was solved was when Flash was no more.<p>The same thing happened with BlueTooth, when Apple decided not to allow file transfer over BT. Then they introduced their own AirDrop, which others copied (e.g., Nearby features on Android and Windows).<p>They also have made a ton of drastic design decisions that took the industry by surprise, but in the end, almost everybody followed suit and embraced those changes. For example, they dropped CD&#x2F;DVD drives, 3.5mm headphone jack, many ports on MacBooks, etc.<p>Given such history, I think the only company that can fix the web is actually not Google, but Apple. Given the number of devices they sell and their grip on Safari, they can easily enforce certain protocols on how websites should be developed.<p>What do you think?",
