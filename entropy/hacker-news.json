      "text": "Looking for advice from those who&#x27;ve successfully left tech. I&#x27;ve been in for 3 1&#x2F;2 years (since graduating). In large part my career has felt like it has been failing upwards. Recently, I quit my job and have gotten to a point where I&#x27;m starting to think I&#x27;m not cut out for this. A few comments on this:<p>1. I&#x27;m not really progressing far into interviews, especially in the technical portions.<p>2. Some simple tech questions are now throwing me through a loop.<p>3. With the negative feedback I&#x27;ve gotten my motivation has basically reduced to 0.<p>4. I&#x27;ve traditionally struggled with logic tasks and have had to take more time than my peers to solve them.<p>5. I&#x27;ve had a hard time connecting and relating to co-workers and team members.<p>My resume reads nicely: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arrjayh&#x2F;arrjayh-resume&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;hickok_resume.pdf and I fortunately get lots of interviews but they pretty quickly fizzle out after 1 or 2 technical assessments.<p>I&#x27;m considering&#x2F;looking into the trades. I&#x27;m hoping there might be a trade where I could leverage some existing skills, but I find that unlikely. Would love to get some feedback from any one out there that has pivoted or at least considered it.",
