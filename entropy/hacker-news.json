      "text": "My biggest gripe with 4G is not its speed but rather how frequent I lose signal. The instances where I need speeds as fast as what 5G offers are also rather rare. To add to that, the cost of cellular data isn&#x27;t noticeably getting cheaper so video streaming with 5G is surely going to be expensive. Given that, wouldn&#x27;t it be more difficult to implement wider coverage with 5G compared to 4G since the former needs more sparsely distributed nodes?",
