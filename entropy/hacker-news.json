      "text": "I think the conventional wisdom is to stay at a company for at least 2 years, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is still agreed upon in this market.<p>My job history is as follows:<p>7 months - quit because they needed me to relocate a long distance<p>13 months - quit because we were acquired by another company and the new leadership was toxic in my opinion<p>5 months - contract, decided to not renew<p>7 months - current<p>I am considering leaving my current job, and I&#x27;m wondering if hiring managers would see it as a red flag. I don&#x27;t want to dox myself but the reasons are:<p>1. Low pay. I was actually happy with the pay when I started but rent and everything has increased tremendously since COVID started. My company&#x27;s health insurance plan was also changed at the beginning of this year and my cost went from 0% to 10% of my after-tax take home pay. I&#x27;ve talked to my boss about both these things and she said it sucked. So I didn&#x27;t formally ask for a raise and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be eligible for one anyway, my other coworkers have not yet received one I don&#x27;t think.<p>2. I&#x27;m not happy about the culture. The only people who get any recognition for their work is the sales team &quot;because they pay the bills.&quot; Even my boss (CTO) agrees. My attempts to fix tech debt is shot down because engineering is seen as a cost center to begin with. My team is fantastic to work with but I don&#x27;t like leadership&#x27;s position.<p>3. Related to my second reason, as someone who is junior I want to sink my teeth into a tough and long term project, but management won&#x27;t allow it and they only want us working on short (and buggy) MVPs and shipped to customers. Our time to ship averages less than a day. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m learning many &quot;proper&quot; engineering skills doing this.<p>4. Similar to my last reason, I want to work in a team with other people in my discipline (QA) to learn from them. Right now my company has 5 engineers but I&#x27;m the only one who works in QA. When I ask for feedback on my code the other engineers say they don&#x27;t know how it works so they can&#x27;t help. But the frontend and backend engineers get plenty of feedback from the other engineers because they&#x27;re more knowledgeable. They&#x27;re trying their best but I feel I&#x27;d learn more working in a team of others rather than by myself.<p>Other than _maybe_ the first reason, I don&#x27;t think I have many strong reasons for leaving and that&#x27;s why I think another employer would see this as a red flag. But I also know there are a lot of job openings these days so I&#x27;m wondering if I should give it a shot.",
