It regularly fails to recognize the date and continuously throws this &gt;Quote line that is unescapable. Sometimes it fails to save entries to file at all. Maybe it&#x27;s the ARM M1 chip? Maybe ZSH? I don&#x27;t know but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work as well as it does on my Thinkpad running Pop_OS.<p>Can anyone suggest an alternative CLI journal tool for Mac?",
