I was scrum master &#x2F; team lead at the time, but heavily involved in all parts of the team process - attend meetings, project manage, give status updates, coding...in the end it was too much.<p>I want to deep dive into team management and leadership, however I don&#x27;t want to experience burn out again (even though I am certainly not over last year&#x27;s events just yet).<p>Can stress tolerance be practices as a skill? Is there a way I can increase my stress tolerance? Or maybe I need to practice caring less when something goes wrong!",
