      "text": "Hi Folks,<p>I&#x27;m trying to get back into macOS application development. I used to know the basics of Objective-C and Cocoa stuff back on the early days of Mac OS X with big cat names. At the time, I got a lot of value from the Cocoa Programming book from Big Nerd Ranch.<p>These days, it seems that every book about programming for Apple platforms is focused on iOS. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my iPad, but I&#x27;d rather develop desktop apps.<p>It appears to me that the documentation site has been neglected, and that the search engine algorithms favour returning videos and quick tutorials over books. Anyway, I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out a good recent book about developing desktop apps for macOS. I don&#x27;t care if it is Swift or Objective-C, I like both.<p>Can someone here point me in a good direction?<p>Thanks.",
