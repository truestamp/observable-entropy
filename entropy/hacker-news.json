      "text": "During the climbing qualifiers at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, I saw commentators struggle with calculating the possibilities of which-athlete-advances.<p>That&#x27;s because the &quot;combined climbing&quot; points are a <i>multiplication</i> of ranking from 3 separate events. Most climbers hate this format, but it&#x27;s fun mathematically.<p>So I wrote this little script that calculates the best-to-worst possible outcome automatically:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;piskvorky&#x2F;ce48a4292fdf878f42495d027949ac45<p>I had fun with it during the women and (especially) men finals, calling the medalists early. The &quot;combined climbing&quot; format will be discontinued after Tokyo, so the script is likely utterly useless.",

Our revenue has been fluctuating a lot in the past 9 months, do I just get the average growth from the first month till now? Or is there another better way to calculate the revenue growth?",
