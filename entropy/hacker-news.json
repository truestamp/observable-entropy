      "text": "Hey all! So I&#x27;m a self-taught developer and got my first jr position a few months back. I really enjoy programming, I didn&#x27;t sign up for a bootcamp or follow any &quot;0 to Employed&quot; type course, I just did what I love and eventually got a job doing it - which I&#x27;m very grateful for. Yet... the job isn&#x27;t what I thought it&#x27;d be.<p>I did some freelance work prior to this and those gigs involved me developing a full application for the client. They&#x27;d give their idea&#x2F;requirements and I&#x27;d make it from the ground. up. I <i>loved</i> that. I love being able to see a program come to life in front of me. I love to start with that blank canvas and through sheer will and dexterity forming it into something beautiful. That&#x27;s what I like about software development.<p>At my new job, however, I&#x27;ve been thrown into a massive legacy codebase and am given specific features to add to implement on top of this already incredibly complex monolith that I can hardly understand. The technology being used is actually pretty interesting and novel, it&#x27;s not just another Java enterprise app or massive Angular webapp. But I&#x27;m not able to really create anything. Any productivity I <i>could</i> have is drained by just navigating the existing maze of code. I might get to add a new feature, but there&#x27;s not true creation happening. None of those features are challenging or novel. I feel like I&#x27;m filling in a coloring book rather than painting on a canvas.<p>Not sure what the point of this rant is, I&#x27;m just a little frustrated. I was so happy to have the chance to get paid to do what I love, but I&#x27;m not loving what I&#x27;m getting paid to do. I&#x27;d try to find another job but I don&#x27;t want to have short periods of employment on my resume and my lack of a degree or any other credentials would make it difficult to ever get to the interview stage. Any suggestions for how I can find passion in my existing job or how I could pivot early in my career so that I <i>can</i> get in at projects inception and be a founding developer?",
