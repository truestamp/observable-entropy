      "text": "Dockerized is like npx for unix tools: Run popular cli tools without installation.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>    dockerized npm init\n    dockerized python2 somescript.py\n</code></pre>\nRun an older version of a tool:<p><pre><code>    NODE_VERSION=15.0 dockerized node\n</code></pre>\nUse cases:\n- Maintaining multiple versions of an app\n- Installing without polluting host machine\n- Quickly run some commands you may not have installed<p>Features:\n- intuitive use. Just the original command, but with &#x27;dockerized&#x27; in front.\n- dockerized apps can access the current directory and read&#x2F;modify files, just like native apps.\n- no need to know which docker image this package comes from.\n- support for tools which don&#x27;t have an official docker image.\n- container cleaned up after use.\n- ability to specify the version.\n- version specification per directory (share exact versions with your team mates).<p>The inner workings are pretty simple, it&#x27;s just a docker-compose file.<p>As expected with dockerization, there are limitations related to networking, and file persistence (outside current dir), but it can make life easy for simple scenarios.<p>Pull requests welcome!",
