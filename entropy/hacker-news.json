      "text": "I&#x27;m a relatively late adopter of Bluetooth, having mainly used cables up until recently. I own a pair of cheapish Anker earbuds and now Audio Technica headphones.<p>I find Bluetooth to be a frustrating experience. Almost every day I encounter issues when I&#x27;m trying to pair say, my headphones, with my MacBook. I hold the power button the headphones to turn them on or they&#x27;re already on standby. I do a few clicks to pair them on my MacBook. macOS says it&#x27;s paired but I didn&#x27;t hear the pairing sound. So I try clicking again to unpair. No unpair sound. I toggle Bluetooth off and on and try pairing again. No dice. I power cycle the headphones and they pair with my phone instead. I hold the up and down volume buttons to force them into pairing mode again...<p>Not to mention that Spotify randomly decides to switch devices sometimes and refuses to switch back unless I kill the app. Or it says my headphones are paired even though Android does not.<p>On the London Underground, my music often goes crackly&#x2F;distorted presumably because of interference from the trains and other devices around me. Frankly I never even considered that could be an issue. And it&#x27;s not a faulty product or anything like that.<p>This isn&#x27;t just a complaint about my AT headphones. My Anker earbuds are just as frustrating.<p>It would be so nice if you could just like, I don&#x27;t know, bump two devices together and they use NFC to pair or something.",
