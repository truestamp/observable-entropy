      "text": "I&#x27;ve heard a lot about people who have catch-all email accounts and subscribe a different address to each service. So, these people may have a nice idea of who sold or leaked their email addresses based on the spam they are getting. Are you one of these people? Can you name your spammers?<p>As a side note, I have a friend from not-US who by mistake used a special address only for this country&#x27;s IRS equivalent (he had something like &quot;unit 12A&quot; instead of just &quot;unit 12&quot;), and he would occasionally get physical spam to that address. I remembered that, then decided to ask this.",
