With our technology, you can skip waiting months and instead start fundraising for your nonprofit, automatically issue tax receipts to your donors, store your funds in a bank account and have an unlimited number of virtual debit cards in order to pay for the expenses of your nonprofit.<p>We have a beta of our product over at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dot.ngo<p>Would love to get some feedback on the idea overall and anyone to try our platform if it interests you.",
