      "text": "I&#x27;m fascinated by the role a technological advantage plays in military victories.<p>In other words, I could defeat the best strategists in history (Napoleon, Caesar, Alexander) and their armies if I have a big technological advantage (e.g. atom bomb).<p>There are thousands of strategy books out there, but I haven&#x27;t found a single book that talks about how important (and decisive) a technological advantage is.<p>The closest I&#x27;ve seen is Neil deGrasse Tyson&#x27;s &quot;Accessory to War&quot; (which I loved!), but it was primarily about the relationship between the astrophysics community and the military community.<p>Is there a book that talks exclusively about technology being the decisive factor in victories throughout history? (and ideally gives several examples)\nThis can go all the way back to bronze weapons losing to iron weapons, to more recently WWII being won by the first country who developed nuclear weapons.",
