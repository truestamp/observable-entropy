      "text": "Today, I happen to buy a Haldiram Snacks (Haldiram Soya Sticks). They are one of India&#x27;s biggest Snacks company competing with Lays &amp; ITC Bingo. This was the product I bought https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;R3JW5Js (image)<p>While eating, I curiously checked its cover. It was actually premium than a Lays package or an ITC Bingo Pack. Here are the things I noted, so you could use it on your product, whether, physical or SAAS. \nThe Packing matters..<p>1. The cover was premium like the image shown above. \nThat means, you only get 3-5 secs to make a first impression, so the cover should talk directly to your customers, aka, your UI design should be attractive than your competitors.<p>2. The pack was easy to open with just your hands, and can close it with an inbuilt zipper inside the pack. \n(images: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;dm35m2D , https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;wQH3StD ) \nThe UI of your application should be easy to use &amp; understandable for the customer, there should not be any confusion.<p>3. The product- Haldiram Soya Stick- is super cool and satisfies the customer looking for snacks. \nMeans, no matter what, if your product won&#x27;t solve the customers problem, there is no use. So the product should be great. Make Something People Want!<p>4. Added a text, &quot;Taste of Tradition&quot; &amp; &quot;Indian Snacks&quot; on its cover. \n(Images: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;b71sdsf , https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;jTH55JL ) \nHaldiram clearly knows, its going to compete with Pepsico Lays(which is a US company). And it also clearly knows its customers - the Indians. Indians are proud of their traditions &amp; proud to say &quot;We are Indians&quot;. So it added those text that resonates with its customers and beating their competition.<p>Add something to your product, that connects your users to their inner feelings, something they would be proud of.<p>5. They cross sell their other products on their cover itself, with a writing &quot;You may also like&quot; \n(Image: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;q0VK6bw ) \nCross sell your other services too for a higher payment cycle or to increase your minimum order value. And it should be clear for the customer, like, &quot;You may also like&quot; text on the Haldiram cover.<p>6. And at the bottom of their cover, there is a write up showing, &quot;If you&#x27;re reading this, its time to grab your next pack!&quot; :D ( Image: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;b1qzwHQ )\nThere should be a clear call to action on your product. I have read somewhere that, you need to remind your customer to buy your product, unless they won&#x27;t even care.<p>So do these to your physical or SaaS or any kind of products! \nI&#x27;m going to implement this after eating the snacks :D \n(Just few thoughts while eating)",
