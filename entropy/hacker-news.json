But creating it didn&#x27;t work. No error message, it simply didn&#x27;t get created. At first I thought creating folders doesn&#x27;t work, but then I tried creating folders with other names, and they worked. Also, creating this folder inside another folder works, but not at the top-level.<p>It turns out you can&#x27;t create a top-level folder called &quot;Calendar&quot;, or whatever you call &quot;Calendar&quot; in the language you have set for the UI. If the UI language is Polish e.g., then you can create &quot;Calendar&quot;, but not &quot;Kalendarz&quot;.<p>I just thought it&#x27;s a funny bug, so I&#x27;m sharing it here.",
