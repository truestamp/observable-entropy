My newsfeed lately is a graveyard only populated by ads and some groups I belong to. The only friends left are narcissists or people selling something. I&#x27;m not motivated to post anything because I get much less engagement in the form of likes or comments than I used to. Just curious if this is just me or everyone knows it&#x27;s dying.",
