      "text": "I&#x27;ve tried to learn programming through many MOOCs but failed multiple times.<p>Are there any good resources that are interesting to learn? \nThe problem I face is most of these MOOCs are too boring in the beginning and I usually end up abandoning them.<p>Lately, I came across Project Euler and I&#x27;m having fun solving the challenges on the platform. I&#x27;m planning to learn Python as I like to pivot my career towards the data side and may create some generative art in the future!<p>Some help would be appreciated!<p>To give some context, I work as a Product Engineer developing digital solutions for an energy company. I don&#x27;t code, but I understand the whole software development process at a high level. I currently act as a bridge between the development team and the management.<p>My expertise in programming is limited to the following:\n- I&#x27;ve fairly a good grasp of HTML, something I learned by editing websites.\n- I know a bit of SQL to query data\n- I have some experience in Arduino programming and know how to code basic stuff\n- I learnt C while in college and understand the basics of loops, conditional statements, etc.",

      "text": "I have remained loyal to Firefox since the earliest time (think eff-ing <i>Phoenix</i>) but lately, changes are really going on my nerves (latest: replacing the reload button on Firefox for iOS with a button for the &quot;Home&quot; screen for whatever reason). I am certainly not averse to change but I don&#x27;t like change as a purpose in itself instead of for the better. Unfortunately, a lot of changes nowadays feel like they are solely to keep the UX team employed. Losing Firefox just for that would be a bad bargain. Gecko is the only decent non-chrome&#x2F;ium browser engine that is left and Firefox is the only browser that is using it. We sorely need this remaining bit of diversity! It <i>needs</i> to survive. Despite that, the current leadership of Mozilla is either hell-bent on actively running it into a brick wall or outright ignorant of the fact that this is actually happening for a while already.<p>Do you think they will somehow turn the corner or is Firefox inevitably going to die? I cannot see how they could possibly avoid it if they keep on doing what they currently are doing.<p>(As sad as it is but I wouldn&#x27;t even put it past them to read one day that &quot;sustaining a browser with a low digit marketshare is not a reasonable use of our resources anymore&quot; and that &quot;Mozilla is glad to announce that from now on, we rather focus on the broader mission instead&quot;).",
