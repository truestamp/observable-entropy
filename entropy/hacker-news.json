That instead of sound logic, cars will learn important behaviors exhaustively in the name of safety.<p>How about instead of 1000 cars on the road guessing and sharing “neural information” we have all manufacturers agree to make future cars equipped with a standard communication signaling system. One that describes turning, speed, dimensions, all necessities for safety. Then older cars can be the AI fallback.",

I am thinking of using Brave instead of Chrome. Brave <i>is</i> faster. But I live in my browser and it&#x27;s a big move. I use Windows, iOS and Linux - home, work and school - so I would be all in if I switched.",
