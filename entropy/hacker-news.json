There is so much jargon and cruft around it; planning poker, story points, scrum master etc..<p>Software quality of what is built in the scrum way seems poor as it does local optimization and doesnt focus on long term.. seems like some thing that would work for consultancies the best?<p>Simple Kanban seems more effective, do you feel the same way? Am I doing scrum wrong? Is scrum built to ensure that program managers &#x2F; product managers have something to do?",
