      "text": "Looking to attempt to accelerate reaching a BS in CS.  Having worked as a software developer for decades, I can teach any introductory, intermediate and most advanced programming courses.  Anything from basics to data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, embedded systems, real time operating systems, web development, etc.  I have worked with over half a dozen languages on various systems, including everything from bare-metal bring-ups in Assembly&#x2F;Forth to, robotics systems and Python&#x2F;Django applications.<p>The point is, I know this stuff.  What I know is equivalent to several years of university coursework.  I am now interested in obtaining a degree in CS, initially a BS and possibly going on to an MS.  This is mostly for personal fulfillment rather than a need.<p>What I don&#x27;t want to do is spend three years writing basic code I can write in my sleep.<p>To this end, I am looking for schools where I might be able to take exams to pass courses rather than have to devote entire semesters or quarters to obtain the credit.  I contacted our local college&#x27;s CS department.  While the school does offer credit for prior learning through examination, the CS department is the only one that does not, at this time, offer that option.<p>There are many interesting online CS courses (For example, I&#x27;ve done the MIT 6.00.1x series), yet none of them provide transferable credits.  Does such a thing exist?<p>An alternative would be super-short terms.  If I could take courses that only go for, say, 8 weeks, instead of 20, well, that might be a decent option.  I would not have to study much, if at all.  So, pass a couple of exams every eight weeks and knock out a few years off a degree timeline quickly.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any input on this.<p>Frankly, this is what is missing in online education today.  A degree granting program that is compatible with people who might have acquired the knowledge outside university walls.  Coding is coding.  Algorithms are algorithms.  Theory is theory.  If you know the subject, and you can prove it, it should not matter one bit where you did the learning.<p>Thanks.",
