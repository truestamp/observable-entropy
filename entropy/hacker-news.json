      "text": "The Great Resignation or the Great Reshuffling pretty much started in 2021 and is still going very strong today. It&#x27;s hard not to feel like you could be missing out if you don&#x27;t take the opportunity now to pursue a better job, especially one with better pay and work-from-home arrangements. That&#x27;s how I felt as my coworkers started moving on to better roles, and when the recruiters started hitting me on LinkedIn, I decided to pay attention. Now a month into my new job, I feel like a traitor and sell-out. I had a long tenure at my previous role and had life pretty easy. I can&#x27;t help but feel that the current wave of job changing is fueled by hype and greed, and honestly I do not think that companies deserve to be screwed by all this turnover. While I am confident I can do fine in my new role, I have a nagging disappointment about contributing to this current trend.",
