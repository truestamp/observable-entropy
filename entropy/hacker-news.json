      "text": "Hi everyone - long time Rails developer here.  I&#x27;ve been building a project with the Phoenix Framework lately and am absolutely loving it.<p>The project requires a high number of Websocket connections and concurrency features - which technically speaking, makes Phoenix a great tool for the job.<p>My only concern is about wether there is a strong enough community to keep the project going for years and years to come.  Jose Valim and Chris McCord have been doing an incredible job and I respect them to the nth degree.<p>My question to the community is twofold - does anyone have thoughts on the future of the Phoenix Framework, and has anyone made a gamble on an upcoming technology that turned out to be the right or totally wrong decision?",
