      "text": "Howdy. I am beginning work on a small application to render out a list of courses, their prerequisites and any dependants in an easy to digest fashion. I spent yesterday scraping the data, and today I would like to begin work on rendering it.<p>To get started, I&#x27;d like to find a framework I can use to render out the relations between each course in a graph. I&#x27;d be fine with working in either JS or Python for this. For anybody who uses Obsidian (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;), the &quot;Graph View&quot; feature is kind of what I am going for? In the sense that I would like the ability to manipulate the graph and not just pump out a static image.<p>I&#x27;ll gladly look into any recommendations, I&#x27;m eager to get this over with!",
