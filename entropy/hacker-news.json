      "text": "I am done with Netflix, Hulu etc. Their quality is not good, it is mostly mindless entertainment anyway. In Netflix&#x27;s case, their documentaries are shitty too.<p>Are there any video services worth subscribing to? Both educational and entertainment? I did some googling, found these so far - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wondrium.com&#x2F;, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curiositystream.com&#x2F;. They seem good, though I am yet to try.<p>Any more? Any diamond in the rough? I am aware of some YouTube channels, but I prefer sites like the two above. Especially indie, smaller teams that I can support, however tiny amount my money is.",
