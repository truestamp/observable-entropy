      "text": "Jetpack Compose is the future of Android UI. Companies and developers do not want to invest hundreds of hours in learning it from scratch.<p>It took me a few months before Compose clicked. This is coming from someone with 10 years of professional Android experience and a passion in UI development. I saw the benefits of the new framework since day 1, but it took a while for it to feel productive with it.<p>Because of this, I decided to make it dead simple for companies and devs to use Jetpack Compose. I am writing an eBook that translates everything you know from Views to Compose so that you can use Compose straight away.<p>The eBook is currently being writen and available for pre-order. I have received some good feedback from people from the Android community so far. Happy to hear your thoughts.<p>- Alex Styl",
