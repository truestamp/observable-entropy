The URL for July&#x27;s report looks something like this:<p>fancyreport.com?from=2022-07-01&amp;to=2022-07-31<p>Typing this URL manually every month was just enough pain for me to put up a simple script on somedomainiown.com&#x2F;magic that redirected me to the report for the current month by automatically filling in the &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; values in the URL. This way, I could bookmark one link and always open the latest report with one click.<p>At some point, I figured I should put this behind a UI so that I could share it with my colleagues and maybe HN too. A couple of weeks of hacking, and here we are with an MVP the little imposter inside me finally accepted to post online.<p>P.S. the &quot;formule&quot; implementation gets the job done for me, but is pretty rudimentary. Would love to know if you have a specific use case that&#x27;d benefit from other parameters or a more advanced formula system.",
