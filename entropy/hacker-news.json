      "text": "Hi all! We’re considering a move to AWS from an on-premise Kubernetes installation. \nFor someone who hasn’t played much with AWS before, how would you recommend to most efficiently get up to speed with best practices, architecture patterns, common pitfalls, etc.?<p>Ideally, we would not lift-and-shift our applications, but instead rearchitect important parts to actually take advantage of AWS’ benefits.<p>So - any great resources you can recommend? Courses, books, blog posts - any recommendations would be appreciated.<p>Thanks!",
