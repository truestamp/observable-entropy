      "text": "I&#x27;m employed at one of the big software giants as a senior engineer. Life has been good so far, except that a sense of job stagnancy is creeping in. I talked to my manager about promotion and moving up the ladder to take on more complex projects, and he said that moving from senior to upper levels is not easy, and irrespective of skillset it takes time and patience (plus the usual take ownership yada yada, most of which I&#x27;m already doing).<p>I&#x27;m almost 40 and there is like an ocean of people in the same boat as me (in my current company), many of them with half my experience.  So, I feel like completely stuck on how to get ahead of the pack.<p>I&#x27;ve taken full ownership of decently sized projects (in terms of complexity&#x2F;scale), with hands-on execution, leading the team all the way from design to the production deployment.  I&#x27;ve tried giving team wide presentations on tech topics, took part in hiring drives and so on, but nothing seems to make any difference.  I&#x27;ve also tried applying to other teams within the company, but they are ready to take me at my current level, but not for a higher level.<p>I often see people reaching the positions of architects&#x2F;tech fellows at these large companies at just 10-12 years of experience, and I fail to understand what exactly did they do right.  Is it all about luck&#x2F;being in right place at the right time ?<p>There&#x27;s the obvious solution of moving to a different (albeit much smaller) company, but I like the work life balance, tech stack we use and some other perks the company provides.  So, trying to see what I can do here before giving up and moving on to a different company altogether.<p>Any&#x2F;All helpful comments is highly appreciated !",
