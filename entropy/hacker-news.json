I&#x27;m looking for ways to issue licenses to those who pay for it (think product key).<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m in no mood to start handling encryption processes so  I started looking for solutions.<p>I came across products like keygen, kryptolens, and netlicensing.io that offer some sort of API to validate licenses within the app, but all of these are small companies with 5-10 people that could go out of business any time and generally I don&#x27;t see any &quot;big names&quot; there.<p>Am I missing something obvious here? What are the standard solutions for this?",

Although we advertise on our web site, unless people are looking quite specifically, they are unlikely to find the adverts (unlike FANGs which would attract candidates directly).<p>Also, Recruiters tend to be a poor and expensive solution. It is hard to tell the good from those who just claim to be good and we get a lot of noise from them. Also, I&#x27;m not sure that the best candidates just call a random recruiter to find them a job.<p>What are others doing to both find jobs and to recruit?",
