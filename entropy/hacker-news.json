      "text": "For the first time in my career I&#x27;m working for a company that gives engineers (and non-engineers) 20% investment time weekly to work on projects of their choosing - open source, presenting, learning new tech, etc. It&#x27;s great.<p>But it&#x27;s also good for them, since everybody keeps getting better at what they do, and it promotes the company as well. So in the long run, it makes them more money.<p>Other than Google (who is known for this), what other companies do you know of that give their people &quot;growth time&quot; &#x2F; &quot;investment time&quot; every week? I&#x27;ve only found a few so far, but there must be more.",
