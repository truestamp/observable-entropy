One central place to get a pulse on project changes, bottlenecks, and updates from across tools. Think of it as a manager IDE.<p>No not an engineering performance measurement tool, a first point of contact to triage and prioritize the day without having to spend time digging into 4-5 information channels  (Slack channels, unexpected meetings, task management boards, pull requests, etc).<p>This is our experimental quest at rethinking the manager workflow. De-cluttering everyday information to get to answers fast with a clear view on where things are and how things are moving is our starting point.<p>We&#x27;d love your feedback!<p>We have over 375+ managers on our waitlist and would love to put this in the hands of all managers.
