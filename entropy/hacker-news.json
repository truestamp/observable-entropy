      "text": "Thought experiment.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that a number of services only work well&#x2F;are viable when the app collects a lot of information from its users.<p>What if we make all app&#x27;s collected data available publicly in a database - with user identity anonymized.<p>This would make me a lot more comfortable to use the service. I would have less of that feeling &quot;they are profiting over me&quot;. And it would incite competition since all companies would have access to the data as well. Something like open banking [1], but for user data.<p>The challenge is to ensure the data is published in a format where you can not trace back to the users, while still allowing ML apps to use it [2].<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear community thoughts on this.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Open_banking\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Differential_privacy",
