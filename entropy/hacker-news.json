      "text": "Hello,<p>I&#x27;d like to ask you for advice regarding career in programming.\nI&#x27;m currently a first year student in software engineering (informatyka stosowana) at Polish university. In future I&#x27;d like to try my luck at finding an apprenticeship, so that after I&#x27;m done with studies I will have some experience.<p>How should I prepare for that task?\nI know that the common advice for this is grinding Leetcode (i.e in general algorithms theory and so on) and having a good Github portfolio. But I&#x27;ve seen people being divided on that one, as I often found voices saying that most likely it is harmful. \nRelated to that, what constitutes a good project to show? I&#x27;ve been toying with ideas of making games in C++ with some graphic library, but all my ideas seem derivative.<p>What would be the tasks I would do as an apprentice? I know that this depends of a looooot of things, but on average what would I be expected to do? (our teachers often scare us that our only job would be making coffee).",
