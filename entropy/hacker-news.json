      "text": "I want to present our library to provide rate-limiting functionality in Java - Bucket4j. \nBased on our library, you can limit your API in Java. \nThrough the Bucket4j, we can work in a distributed environment because we have implementations with many databases, such as Redis, Hazelcast, Apache Ignite, Infinispan, Oracle coherence, Dynamodb, PostgreSQL, MySQL, e.t.c.\nAlso, we have a considerable API to work with Rate-Limiting: \n1) Monitoring API - you can monitor all of your limits in runtime through any monitoring system (dropwizard, prometeus, e.t.c).\n2) On-the-fly Configuration replacement - you can replace a configuration with a new configuration and distribute tokens as needed.\n3) Diagnostic API - to get detailed information about limits.\n4) Batching API - to optimize work with database for high load keys.\n5) Blocking API\n6) Scheduler API\n7) Opportunity to work with multi-bandwidth management\n...\nAnd many other APIs.<p>If you work with Java and need a rate-limiting in your project, please look to Bucket4j.<p>GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bucket4j&#x2F;bucket4j<p>Report about Bucket4j: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kG_hF7p7xYI<p>Thank you for your attention!",
