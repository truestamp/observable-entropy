      "text": "I&#x27;m trying to build a bit of a homelab at my apartment in the US (East Coast), but there just aren&#x27;t any ISPs which offer good upload bandwidth in my area.<p>I find myself often wanting to move around 5-250GB of data, and I&#x27;m looking for a way to do that quickly.<p>I can think of two approaches:<p>1) Rent a cloud instance, and use their high bandwidth connection.\n2) Rent a bare metal server, and use their high bandwidth connection.<p>What service would you recommend for solving this problem? My two main use cases would be:\n1) Download files quickly to the server.\n2) Send files quickly from this server to another device.<p>The cloud computing is full of so many different services that I&#x27;m having a hard time even comparing a cheap linux server to something offered by a cloud provider. Does anyone have any recommendations?",
