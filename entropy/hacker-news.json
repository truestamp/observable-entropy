      "text": "Hi HN, we are Deepak and Sama, co-founders of BoxyHQ (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boxyhq.com&#x2F;). BoxyHQ provides an open-source platform for developers to quickly integrate enterprise features into their software solutions. These include SAML Single Sign-On (SSO), Audit logs, with more to come :)<p>We know how tedious SAML SSO integrations can be, so we built a free tool to help you with testing the feature as you go about building it. Mock SAML emulates a SAML Identity Provider and lets you test both Service Provider and Identity Provider flows without having to create accounts or users. Head over to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mocksaml.com to try it out, there’s no registration required.<p>We have also open-sourced the code (Apache 2.0 license), so feel free to head over to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;boxyhq&#x2F;mock-saml and self-host the service or even better make it part of your CI&#x2F;CD pipeline to add SAML tests.<p>Our team would love to hear your feedback, you can also reach out to me at deepak@boxyhq.com",
