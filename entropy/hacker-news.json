      "text": "So I’ve learned today that Canadians need a smartphone, probably only iPhone or Android, to travel back to Canada. They have this new app, ArriveCan, that they require you to fill out some basic information that probably would be fine to fill out with paper or something else. But that option simply does not exist.<p>For most of our crowd, this is not an issue. But imagine those that are older. Those that don’t want to use android or iOS. Or in the case of a friend, those who have low battery and basically no data.<p>I think it’s ridiculous.<p>(for the record: I am strongly pro-vaccine and pretty in favor of reasonable restrictions)",

      "text": "Hacker news is filled with political posts. These types of posts include posts on Government regulation, legal, politics, international politics, party politics, European politics, US&#x2F;China relations etc. Its well within our right and within the HN policy. However I wonder if we should change that policy?<p>I find the community is unwelcoming to ideas other than establishment Democratic Party views, and that makes discussion particularity boring, nonconstructive, and tends toward flame war type discussion. Users that express the wrong opinion, are  met with downvotes and this feels very unnecessary.<p>I propose either 1) ban political posts (we did this after the 2016 election for 1 week or 2) create a politics tab, whose posts are not featured, allowing users to flag posts as politics.<p>What do you think?",
