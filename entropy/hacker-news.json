      "text": "We all agree that Bitcoin is a waste of energy.<p>According to recent reports, Bitcoin comsumes the same amount of energy as Argentina.<p>Therefore, it would only take the combined processing power of a network of people greater than that of Argentina to corrupt the ledger and destroy the trust in the currency.<p>We have more combined processing power to finally make this achievable.<p>I agree that some people have invested in Bitcoin as a hedge against their country&#x27;s failing currency.<p>But these people are in the minority, and a full-scale network attack on this technology is for the greater good of the planet as a whole.<p>So this is a call to arms. While Bitcoin is still vulnerable, who is prepared to attack it in a coordinated manner and undermine the technology of this space forever?<p>I believe this is the last opportunity we&#x27;ll have.",
