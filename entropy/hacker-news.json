The dashboards are custom built but accessible via the web.<p>We&#x27;d like to set up about 6 of these devices and want to keep them as low maintenance as possible.<p>It feels like overkill to setup a laptop for each screen just for this purpose but we weren&#x27;t sure in 2022 what the best approach from a cost and reliability perspective would be.<p>Some routes we have considered:<p><pre><code>  - Use &#x27;Smart TVs&#x27; and rely on the built-in browser (can be janky to use)\n  - Use a Raspberry Pi connected to a monitor (hard to source new Pi&#x27;s at the moment)\n  - Use an Amazon Fire Stick (they have an auto-sleep that can&#x27;t seem to be disabled)\n  - Use an no-name Raspberry Pi-esque mini USB-C PC (dubious quality)\n</code></pre>\nDo any of those seem like the obvious choice or are we missing something even more straightforward?",
