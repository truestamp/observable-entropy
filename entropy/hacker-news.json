      "text": "Here is a potentially great opportunity for game development teams and small companies, completely free, all costs covered, and no strings attached.<p>This coming summer we are running the third edition of F2P Campus in Spain from July 18 to September 18. This is a not-for-profit accelerator for free-to-play game development teams that covers all your costs (travel up to a certain amount, an apartment for your team, meals, local transport, work area and even gym&#x2F;swimming pool pass), with no strings attached. It is funded by local institutions, with the sole aim of fostering the local game dev ecosystem. It is open to teams from anywhere in the world (in the past we&#x27;ve had teams from Finland, Canada, South Korea, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine, and Spain).<p>During the campus, we bring top industry professionals, such as VP-level executives, senior designers, etc... to mentor the teams. We have had mentors from the US, South Korea, China, and all over Europe: King, Nexon, Ubi Soft, Social Point, Scopely, Tilting Point, Zeptolab, and many more. Great advice &amp; connections.<p>We already ran two editions in 2018 and 2019 and there are several teams out of those batches who have gone on to hit it big (one of the teams was just the 3 founders, and went on to get 250MM+ downloads, they&#x27;re a 20-person team today and growing).<p>Here are three links for more info:<p>* 2-min video summary of the 2018 edition: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g8qfCTbOeLE<p>* 2-min video summary of the 2019 edition: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cdkb8jG0ZZQ<p>* Web site: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.f2pcampus.com<p>Deadline for applications is June 5, so it&#x27;s tight, but the application process is bureaucracy free - just present your team and project with some support materials.",
