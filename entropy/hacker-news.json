      "text": "Currently I hear more and more people talking about Scrum being the &quot;old way&quot; of developing software, but imho Scrum is still extremely entrenched (at least here in Europe).<p>At my current place (product company) we do things like: have a one hour meeting to discuss what we&#x27;re going to discuss in a later one hour backlog meeting, the output of which which will decide what we &quot;analyze&quot; in 4 separate 1 hour full-team estimation meetings, which will dictate what we &quot;commit&quot; to during the full-day full-team demo&#x2F;retro&#x2F;commitment scrum day. We do this every 2 weeks. No wonder Product Management seem unsatisfied with the progress we&#x27;re making, but they seem powerless to stop this madness.<p>What project management approach have you seen gaining in popularity to replace Scrum? What comes next? Any ideas?",
