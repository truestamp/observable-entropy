      "text": "I feel like I hate IG for personal reasons and reasons that have been discussed ad nauseam. But as an artist I feel like it&#x27;s the only place to share work with professional peers. That said I very intentionally shifted to a dev career to not be financially dependent on my art, platforms like IG, broken arts institutions, toxic art communities etc. In any case considering fully getting off IG at long last but wanted to solicit some general wisdom from my favorite dev community. Thanks in advance :^p",
