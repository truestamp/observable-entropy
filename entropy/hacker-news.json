It&#x27;s in the Intelex Past Masters series of Philosophy texts, which is available online at (most&#x2F;many?) universities, but I&#x27;m not at one. (It seems individuals can&#x27;t subscribe to that - I just tried.) It&#x27;s seemingly not on LibGen&#x2F;Scihub, or archive.org, Gutenberg, or anywhere online, and it seems paper copies start at &gt;$400 for its 130 pages. The book was published in 1939, reprinted in 1994. How can I get hold of it? Paper or ebook is fine. Any ideas? What&#x2F;where else should I try? I&#x27;m willing to pay, but not &gt;$400!
