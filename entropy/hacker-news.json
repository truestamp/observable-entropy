Is there a similar workflow I can use on Linux &#x2F; BSD?<p>Requirements:<p><pre><code>  - Easy &amp; fast sync music from desktop to mobile and vice versa. (Should only sync diff of course. Remote sync is a plus)\n  - Decent music library management, easy CRUD &amp; tag edit\n  - Decent music playing experience on both desktop &amp; mobile\n  - Scriptable and nice interface would be a plus plus</code></pre>",
