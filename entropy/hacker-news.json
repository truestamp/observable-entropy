      "text": "There&#x27;s a new frontend for Imgur called IMGIN[0] and it&#x27;s great for viewing Imgur posts without all the tracking and having to view with JS turned on.<p>I was thinking: Since Imgur became so popular because of Reddit (and was eventually sold to Medialab later on), that Hackernews should have its own (unofficial fan based) image-sharing service. We could support the project with Patreon or Liberapay if needed.<p>There&#x27;s always different services I&#x27;ve seen people use, and we can&#x27;t seem to agree on which one to use. Many have questionable privacy and are monetized with privacy-invasive ADs to stay afloat.<p>I think images are sometimes a great way to explain concepts without resorting to words. There&#x27;s plenty of tech-related memes I have stored up that I&#x27;d love to share, but would much rather share on an agreed-upon service that all HN&#x27;ers collectively like, instead of sketchy services.<p>Can we build this, or is that a huge ask?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgin.voidnet.tech&#x2F;",
