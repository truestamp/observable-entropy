      "text": "I grow tired of 4+ subscriptions running concurrently and I am considering moving back to purchasing original content and (re)building my content library.<p>Is there an open source content library management system that I can run on a SmartTV or RaspberryPi?<p>It’s important to me that my kids have the ability to safely find content that my wife and I find suitable for the children, and that is growing harder to do with modern subscription services.<p>It would be ideal if I can index my own DVD rips and VHS-&gt;MP4 files, and store this all locally for personal use.<p>Any help is appreciated!",
