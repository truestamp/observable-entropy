      "text": "My small, tech-savvy-but-not-tech team needs a project management system -- projects&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;kanban, maybe a wiki. But open-source solutions with good UI&#x2F;UX seem to be, almost inevitably, designed around software projects and I know from past experience something clunky won&#x27;t get used regularly.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at YouTrack, Gitlab, Taiga and others -- all fantastic, if only I could sufficiently hide some of the dev-specific functionality. Should I just give up and get a ClickUp or Jira subscription? Or have you found a self-hosted option for non-software project management?",

      "text": "For context, I recently made an iOS app as a hobby project. Overall, I found the SwiftUI development experience very pleasant compared to using React Native a few years back or a native iOS app even further back.<p>I’m interested in trying out one or two alternatives for Android or cross-platform apps, but I’d like to actually try using my app(s) more substantially on both platforms.<p>Is there any way having two phones is not as terrible as I imagine it would be? Is there a particularly good Android tablet&#x2F;phablet I should consider?<p>I’m personally interested in mainly continuing to use iOS devices and mixing in an Android device, but I’m curious if anyone has successfully done the opposite as well.",
