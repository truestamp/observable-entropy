      "text": "Hi all,<p>I _love_ Neovim. However, I think many parts of it could be easier to configure or understand, especially when it comes to LSPs. There&#x27;s a ton of plugins that fill the gap, but some of them are sparse in documentation. There&#x27;s also distributions like LunarVim that attempt to add a Doom Emacs-like layer above.<p>My approach is a bit different, simply giving an opinionated, modular, and documented configuration that an interested user can easily modify to their needs. It makes use of the most helpful plugins I&#x27;ve encountered to create the best experience I could muster while retaining an air of simplicity.<p>I hope this is helpful to someone out there!",
