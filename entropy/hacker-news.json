It could take the form of government grants depending on the size. My rationale is that governments benefit from the general prosperity of open source more so than solo authors or small companies.<p>I am restricting the scope to simple and small libraries where investment is more clearly beneficial unlike Tensorflow as that is large and complex.<p>Here is an extreme example, the &#x27;either&#x27; crate is a &#x27;rayon&#x27; dependency and many others. Paradoxically a project of this size likely does not need funding but it is really important.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bluss&#x2F;either<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;either&#x2F;reverse_dependencies<p>With applications having so many dependencies, peculiar&#x2F;&#x27;rogue&#x27; library changes are guaranteed.",
