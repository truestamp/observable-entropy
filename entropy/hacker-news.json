Once a month seems like a good interval for me.<p>Doing this, though, would take away my chance of participating in some discussions I otherwise would, as they&#x27;d be archived before I see them.<p>Increasing submission life to a month will mitigate that and allow me, and likely others, to reduce the amount of time spent on HN looking for interesting links and waiting&#x2F;hoping for them to become successful so we have plenty of people to have a discussion with.<p>And there have been many threads on HN which I wish didn&#x27;t die out so early, because there was plenty opportunity for it to grow further.<p>I&#x27;d like to read what the HN crowd thinks about this and what you like&#x2F;dislike about it.",
