      "text": "Why does every post having to do with a scientifically testable question almost invariably have top comments which are purely anecdotal rather than even attempting to point at empirical evidence?<p>This is particularly noticeable in anything having to do with quality of life or lifestyle questions, including the current front page question about anti-depressants. Indeed that relatively upvoted post goes so far as to ask purely for anecdotes - neatly dismissing nearly a century of evidence on the placebo effect, the known wide variance of reactions to any intervention and a million other documented factors that render anecdotes useless. Indeed, as far as HN is concerned, we may as well be in the dark ages, taking a poll on how HNers respond to leeches.<p>On a site users often describe as a kind of oasis from the nonsense perpetuated on the rest of social media, this seems rather baffling and suggests a need for - at minimum - some self-reflection.",
