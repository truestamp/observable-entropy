      "text": "Hi, I graduated from an enginnering school since 10 months now. I have had a job as a fullstack dev just after graduation in small company where the main activity is (solutions integrator) So  I&#x27;m the only Dev in there.<p>I like the work environment, but my main problem is that I feel that I need a superior who knows well about programming and who can help me out when facing some bugs or critical questions. Since I&#x27;ve started I&#x27;ve been working with several programming languages dependng on customers proposals. I don&#x27;t like that because I&#x27;m not being good at any of them. Because I don&#x27;t have the time needed to learn that programminglanguage and all technologies around it. I don&#x27;t know if I have to keep with the company or not. What are the advantages and the drawbacks of staying in this company.\nSorry my bad english.",
