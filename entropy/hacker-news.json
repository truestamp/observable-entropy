      "text": "Recently I started doing exercises over at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exercism.org&#x2F; and they just overhauled their platform with new features and most importantly a new user interface.<p>I spent about half an hour trying a couple of challenges and navigating the site and I noticed I started having a headache.<p>The website contains a ton of information and all of the information is organized in a way to make the UI look good, without giving much attention to the user experience, I noticed the following pattern in the site:\n- Overly formatted text (Bold, Underlines, Italics, Heading...). I mean it&#x27;s just way too much.\n- Excessive use of graphics and drawings. Yes, they are pretty, but they are everywhere!\n- As a newcomer I found the onboarding to be fair, but after the onboarding things started to go south, I couldn&#x27;t find where the exercises were located, there were lessons, paths of some sort and exercises in between, things quickly got messy and I was going back and fourth trying to find where I was.<p>Now I might be ranting and everything&#x27;s fine with the site, but I want to really know is this the new modern web? Is this the way a website &#x2F; web app should be laid out? With rounded borders, graphics, icons and different colors all over the place?<p>Also please do keep in mind I have nothing against Exercism itself, I really do like their platform and their exercises, I am just sharing my opinion on a topic which started to really get into my nerves lately with most sites I visit.",
