      "text": "Note: I graduated a master in CS in 2018. So I am by no means a new student.<p>I was thinking of studying an applied mathematics degree at the Technical University of Delft [1]. So I contacted a student who graduated from it and he told me that the program is very proof-based and not much about mathematical modeling (it has a few courses on it but that&#x27;s it). I find this odd since I had the (perhaps naive) impression that when you <i>apply</i> mathematics, then it means you are using mathematics to model something.<p>So my question is: which bachelor program comes closest to getting a lot of experience in mathematical modeling? I kind of have the feeling that a bachelor of applied physics has more mathematical modeling in it, but also a lot of IRL experimentation (which I do not feel like learning, I just want to model a phenomenon or a bunch of data).<p>Has anyone done a program that had a lot of mathematical modeling in it?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tudelft.nl&#x2F;en&#x2F;education&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;bachelors&#x2F;tw&#x2F;bachelor-of-applied-mathematics&#x2F;the-curriculum",
