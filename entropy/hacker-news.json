It used to be in the good ol&#x27; days you would search for a topic and some forum would discuss it at length, with hundreds of comments, and then the topic got locked as the issue was resolved.<p>I still see forums in search results, but they&#x27;re mostly old-timer forums which have sufficient funding and a credible userbase, and are staying regardless.<p>Did social media absorb these forums? Did messenger apps absorb them? Did Discord absorb them? Did Reddit absorb them?<p>Where&#x27;s have all the forums gone?",
