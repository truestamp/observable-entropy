      "text": "I do lots of data analyses in the command-line and I was missing a simple utility to plot the output of a command (without having to script it). I like very much the Matplotlib API but I found no CLI to pipe data into it. So, I wrote MatplotCLI, a simple CLI that reads data from the stdin and allows to easily create interactive plots from the command-line. Have a look at the README for  examples and recipes. Let me know what you think, thanks!<p>Some examples:<p><pre><code>    $ plt &quot;hist(x,30)&quot; &lt; sample.json\n\n    $ cat sample.json | plt --no-show &quot;hist(x,30); savefig(&#x27;myimage.png&#x27;)&quot;\n\n    $ plt --no-input &quot;\n    x = np.linspace(-1,1,2000);\n    y = x*np.sin(1&#x2F;x);\n    plot(x,y);\n    axis(&#x27;scaled&#x27;);\n    grid(True)&quot;</code></pre>",
