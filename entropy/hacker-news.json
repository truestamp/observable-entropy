      "text": "I have been typing on computer keyboards since the Eighties. Naturally, I have become a very proficient typist.<p>For the past decade or so, I have been trying to do the same thing with on-screen keyboards (tablets, phones). It&#x27;s been a total failure - and I&#x27;m quite annoyed by my lack of progress with those. No matter what I try - pecking the screen with my indexes, trying to use my thumbs (seriously? how do people do it? thumbs are the largest fingers, how do you hit the letter you want with them?), using a wavy movement with my index, without lifting it until the desired word is suggested - everything I&#x27;ve tried is far less efficient than typing on a keyboard, even on a lousy one.<p>What am I missing? How did <i>you</i> get proficient with on-screen keyboards, fellow HNers?",
