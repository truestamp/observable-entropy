      "text": "I launched MVP - website builder for podcasters a year ago just to validate my idea. Reached $1000MRR, earned over $10k in the last year, reInvested that money and reLaunched a few days ago!<p>In case I&#x27;ve already validated my idea (hope so) the main target of this post is not to get feedback or to get more customers (of course both are nice to have :D). The main purpose of my post is to say that everybody knows so far, but probably sometimes ignores it. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend months or years implementing &quot;all possible features&quot; and spending time on pixel-shifting. Just get that shit out as soon as possible and try to sell it. You will have time for improvements and polishing later on, and the most important part - you will have some feedback from your early customers, they will give you the directions!<p>Yes I know, this is nothing new. I&#x27;ve read this many times before, but somehow ignored it, burned more than 6 years building things that nobody needs, and of course none of them are running today.<p>This website builder was my first try to go with MVP:<p>1. Launched MVP on December 2020<p>2. Found early customers in the next months<p>3. Collected a feedback and implemented the most requested features<p>4. After noticing that it&#x27;s growing month by month, invested almost all earned $ into reBranding: premium domain https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onpodium.com (previously it was podsite.io), hired designer for logo, website design, paid for consultations with marketers, implemented many different features and relaunched&#x2F;rebranded two days ago<p>5. The TODO list is still huge, but it&#x27;s not MVP anymore and I can&#x27;t wait for what will happen in 2022!<p>I didn&#x27;t say anything new, but if this post will trigger at least one of you to think again that MVP is enough for the start - then I think it&#x27;s enough! :)<p>Good luck with your side projects!",
