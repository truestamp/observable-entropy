      "text": "I am involved with a small-scale open source CMS project. We&#x27;ve had a recent uptick of incoming emails concerning CCPA, with a similar boilerplate:<p>==8&lt;==<p>To Whom It May Concern:<p>My name is [REDCATED], and I am a resident of Norfolk, Virginia. I have a few questions about your process for responding to California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) data access requests:<p>Would you process a CCPA data access request from me even though I am not a resident of California?\nDo you process CCPA data access requests via email, a website, or telephone? If via a website, what is the URL I should go to?\nWhat personal information do I have to submit for you to verify and process a CCPA data access request?\nWhat information do you provide in response to a CCPA data access request?\nTo be clear, I am not submitting a data access request at this time. My questions are about your process for when I do submit a request.<p>Thank you in advance for your answers to these questions. If there is a better contact for processing CCPA requests regarding [REDACTED].com, I kindly ask that you forward my request to them.<p>I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within 45 days of this email, as required by Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.<p>Sincerely,<p>[REDACTED]<p>==8&lt;==<p>I don&#x27;t recognise any of the names (we&#x27;re a small project, we know a lot of the users between us) and they&#x27;re all using small &#x2F; anonymous email providers. The emails arrive at an advertised email address, so it&#x27;s not obviously a test to check for a warm human…or is it? A reply is sent with a link to our privacy policy, and a clarification that we don&#x27;t store any user data outside of forum user accounts, and answers to the questions. It&#x27;s a copy-paste job to send a reply, and it&#x27;s done promptly, but I&#x27;m confused as to what&#x27;s triggered the influx of emails. Am I missing something?",
