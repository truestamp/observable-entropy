      "text": "After the Giveupgithub.org campaign, i started thinking about leaving GitHub.\nI don&#x27;t have big projects on GitHub, but everyone moving will help the campaign, and send a clear message to GitHub leadership about Copilot.<p>I tried switching for a bit with Gitea(Codeberg) and Drone CI&#x2F;CD.\nAnd it was OK, but i missed a lot of the niceties of GitHub, and i felt that Drone CI&#x2F;CD is not that great compared to GH-Actions or GitLab CI&#x2F;CD.\nI returned to GitHub due to popularity and the nicites of GH-actions but I&#x27;m now thinking of using GitLab.\nYes its closed source(gitlab.com) and its limited on the free tier(especially for projects, even open repos), but its probably more funded and stable than community hosts like Codeberg, and the CI&#x2F;CD is awesome, with 50,000 minutes for Public repos or self hosting.\nAnd there is no Copilot, at least not yet.\nGitlab.com is not listed on the SFC&#x27;s website, because its not open source, but i think its better than just sticking with GitHub.\nOn the other hand, its still closed source, and its way more (free tier) limited and less popular than GitHub.<p>So what do you think? is switching to GitLab for Ethical reasons the right choice? or it doesn&#x27;t really make sense unless its an actually open platform?",
