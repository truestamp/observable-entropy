Absolutely dreading the return to the daily commute. Also got a first child on the way and would love to see them grow up!<p>Unfortunately the bank is not very open to permanent wfh, for the usual variety of reasons like &quot;in-person energy&quot; despite most colleagues being in India or the US (so effectively remote to me).<p>Are there any banks or buy-side firms which allow&#x2F;appreciate fully-remote?<p>What sort of compensation is attainable?<p>Keen to hear your experiences.",
