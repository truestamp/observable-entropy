Employable is a vague term but when I think about most online college courses I imagine they teach more theory than practical skills used in most tech jobs to me.<p>I&#x27;d imagine learning web development is probably the fastest track to becoming employable today but I&#x27;m curious what your recommendations are for how to learn that in the fastest way.",
