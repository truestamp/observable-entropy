      "text": "A lot of people asked when Five&#x2F;Three&#x2F;One would be on Android when it made the front page a couple of weeks ago. That day has arrived!<p>I&#x27;ve already made $70 from IAP in the two initial weeks, which is more than I expected. My goal for now is to make a grand total of a grand, like I did with the iOS app (which is now making &gt;$500&#x2F;mo [0]).<p>Anyways, this is not the end of the journey. I&#x27;m starting work on another tiny project for now, but will work on an Apple Watch companion for Five&#x2F;Three&#x2F;One after that.<p>Hope you enjoy and get stronger!<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31508009\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31508009</a>",
