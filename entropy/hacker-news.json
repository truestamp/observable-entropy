      "text": "I have struggled to find my place in DAOs.<p>It&#x27;s great that DAOs are open organizations and you can join to any Discord you like. However, sometimes it feels very hard to really find your own place in any of them. You participate in discussions, vote in proposals, and still might miss a project if you&#x27;re not online at the right time (happens often to me since I&#x27;m from Europe...).<p>When you apply for a traditional job, you at least know the process â€“ traditional jobs have multiple problems (not least the very existence of gatekeepers!) but if anything it&#x27;s easy to know how to get involved. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the case with DAOs today.<p>I think there are two main problems in joining DAOs today:<p>- How to get involved? It feels like all organizations have their own ways of onboarding new contributors. I&#x27;d just like to start coding immediately without a need to grind my way from bottom in every org.\n- Which organizations to contribute to? There are so many new orgs emerging all the time that I constantly feel like missing out of something.<p>To solve this, my co-founder and I founded Kleoverse (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kleoverse.com&#x2F;). We gather together all DAOs and open Web3 working opportunities, so that it&#x27;s frictionless for you as a developer to find the most suitable projects and organizations to work with.<p>Soon, we&#x27;ll help you to build your Web3-native professional identity so that you can verifiably prove your talent. Makes it even easier to find work in Web3 and DAOs :)<p>If you find this interesting, ensure your early access by signing up today",
