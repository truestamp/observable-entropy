      "text": "Any technologist familiar with blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs is almost certainly aware that the entire scope of these technologies is promoting fraud, scams, and Greater Fool schemes.  As a legitimate technological framework for the mythical decentralized &quot;Web 3.0&quot;, anyone who spends more then an hour learning about how enthusiasts propose to actually implement &quot;Web 3.0&quot; tech on blockchains knows that there is not a shred of legitimacy to the thought that blockchain can drive even a tiny, mundane application - never-mind the &quot;new web&quot;.<p>For those not familiar with the industry, the YouTube documentary &quot;Line Goes Up&quot; by Dan Olson (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) has been pointed to many times in HN threads, and is a great introduction to how dangerous these technologies really are.  Within a few hours of following any tutorial on building a decentralized app, most developers should be able to see what an absolute disaster zone trying to work with this fundamentally broken technology would be, and what a nightmarish step backwards it is for developers concerned with cost, speed, privacy, safety, and ease.<p>I think it is important as technologists, engineers, and developers that we start making it very loud and clear to the public how fraud-ridden and dangerous these systems are.  With most early-adopters running dry, the Ponzi scheme will only be able to continue by expanding into the average consumer market - and if as a community we stay silent about why and how these systems are simply convoluted scam practices, we are dooming ourselves to work with them.",
