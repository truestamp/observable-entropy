      "text": "Hi all,<p>Just released a new version of taskwarrior-syncall (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bergercookie&#x2F;taskwarrior-syncall\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bergercookie&#x2F;taskwarrior-syncall</a>). It&#x27;s a bi-directional synchronization framework, which keeps in sync your Taskwarrior tasks with a variety of other services including Google Calendar events and Notion.<p>In the latest version, I&#x27;m adding support for synchronization with checklists in Google Keep. I.e., every Taskwarrior task is converted and kept in sync with an item in a google keep note check list.<p>Demo here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bergercookie&#x2F;taskwarrior-syncall&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;misc&#x2F;tw_gkeep_sync.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bergercookie&#x2F;taskwarrior-syncall&#x2F;blob&#x2F;mas...</a>",

      "text": "Over time I&#x27;ve developed an internal library which I think is super neat. It&#x27;s a state management library for react and we use it everywhere in our codebase for some time. I asked my boss if I could open source under my GitHub to which he responded that it should go under the companies&#x27; GitHub and now is not the right time to do that.<p>It just feels so unfair to me. I guess he is probably correct, legally speaking. This kind of legal flex really demoralizes me though. Am I now at risk of some legal issue by even disclosing this discussion publicly?<p>Have you had this issue before? What&#x27;s your view?",
