If I don&#x27;t, fine, let the crowd downvote me. But why do the mods and Hacker News use bots and artificial down votes instead of outright bans? It is like they are trying to drive a different consensus that they like better than allowing what the crowd would naturally let rise or fall. It&#x27;s censorship full tilt in my opinion on a site that proudly boasts the America notion of free speech and right to not be censored. I guess they mean government censoring, but they can censor citizens how they like.",
