      "text": "I&#x27;m curious about a game genre that seems really niche. A poverty or low-income simulator game that might put people in the shoes of such folks, particularly showing the struggles of low-income people in the USA without much of a safety net.<p>There is SPENT (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;playspent.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;). It&#x27;s a linear, choose your own adventure story, but not really a game, IMHO.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a couple apps on Google Play but they have under 100 downloads, and focus more on stock trading.<p>Is this a niche worth exploring? Would it be possible to make a game that is both entertaining and educational about the real challenges these people face, at the same time?",
