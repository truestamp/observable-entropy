I&#x27;m talking about failures that will have life long consequences unless solution is found or miracle happens soon. When your last hope utterly shatters. When you have already tried multiple times and failed. When there is no space left behind you to retreat. When it&#x27;s your fault too and lot of being unlucky.<p>How do you deal with rejections and failures where everything was riding on it and you did 200% and hoped for the luck, but it still didn&#x27;t work out just like last 10 times it  before it.<p>I guess I want to know how to rebound, how improve chances of success, how to not let every setback cause you to think back on last 1000 back to back failures.<p>I&#x27;ve read all motivation quotes so don&#x27;t cite them.",
