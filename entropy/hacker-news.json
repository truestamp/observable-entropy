      "text": "This whole process is sucky for seemingly no reason. We found our own home we want and put a single offer and it got accepted and yet our realtor is taking a 2.5% cut.<p>Our mortgage officer only seems knowledgeable because they uses terms I can&#x27;t understand but it seems like most of their work is just plugging my numbers into a calculator to tell me my options (and not really giving me much advice). Seems like I could do this myself but I&#x27;m scared my info will get sold to a million more people.<p>Speaking of which, as soon as I submitted information to a loan officer they pulled my credit which then led to dozens of spam calls from mortgage companies. Finally I found out that when my credit was pulled, Equifax gave my info out to a bunch of people telling them I was looking for a mortgage. I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this.<p>These things are just the beginning and I&#x27;d imagine there are some tools or approaches that could reduce the pain, even just a little bit.",
