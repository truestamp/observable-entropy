      "text": "Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve started receiving robocalls from area codes that I happen to have just called or received a call from.<p>At first I thought this was just me noticing a pattern that wasn&#x27;t really there, but when I looked back at my phone records I could see that I had literally never received a phone call from either of these area codes, and that within a day of talking with someone in that area code.<p>Has anyone else experienced this? How would robocallers get this information — interception, buying it from my cell phone company, or something else?<p>Even if they&#x27;re just buying a list of area codes I&#x27;ve talked to, this seems completely inappropriate. And if they&#x27;re getting the actual numbers, that&#x27;s even worse.",
