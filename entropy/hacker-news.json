      "text": "Hey HN,<p>I with my team just launched LeaksID on Product Hunt: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;leaksid. LeaksID is an online converter that enriches documents with anti-leak invisible marks.<p>With LeaksID, you can be sure that all your private documents are protected.<p>How does it work?<p>- Upload your documents into the system\n- LeaksID will automatically add anti-leak marks (our marks are not watermarks! the main comparison is that our marks are invisible and you can&#x27;t remove them)\n- View, share and print your documents. Every time, you will get a unique enriched copy\n- If one of your documents is compromised, with LeaksID you will be able to find the leaker (even the name of a violator)<p>Interesting fact: LeaksID can create more than 2 trillion unique copies of one A4 document!<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback from the community. And if you have any questions about the marking technology, how LeaksID adds marks, how we investigate the leaker, feel free to ask.<p>Thank you!",

      "text": "There really needs to be a freelance job board or something that allows refugees and asylum seekers in dangerous countries to do remote work and get paid safely (Bitcoin for instance) so they can support themselves. Imagine being an engineer hiding out in Afghanistan right now with no way to support yourself because you can&#x27;t &quot;verify your identity&quot;. You may have to hide for years or face death. That&#x27;s a big issue that needs to be solved. My question is has this been solved and I just can&#x27;t find anything? Or is it just something that can&#x27;t be solved and we leave these people helpless? Seems like a major humanitarian issue that could be easily solved.",
