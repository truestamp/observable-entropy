For those who don&#x27;t know, Logitech has special software to remap certain buttons on the mouse, as well as change scrolling direction, etc. Many users (including me) have run into issues where the software stops remapping the buttons, and it won&#x27;t be fixed until a reboot of the computer. Not even reseting the bluetooth module or killing bluetoothd will fix it. Note that this only happens when the mouse is connected via bluetooth, not via the USB receiver.<p>A few days ago I stumbled upon the strangest fix: unlocking my Bitwarden password manager, which is installed as a Safari extension. So far this is 100% reproducible, across dozens of tries. I can&#x27;t see the connection, and don&#x27;t have the time to spend debugging, but this info may be useful to other Logitech mouse users.",
