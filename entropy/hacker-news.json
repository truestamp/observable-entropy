      "text": "I think I may have tricked myself into a confirmation bias when it comes to my personal thoughts on the subject. It seems the algorithms have decided I like watching TEOTWAWKI type videos on Youtube and now my personalized adds are all for Prepper items and Bullion.<p>The stock markets have treated me quite well the last couple years but recently I have been feeling nervous.<p>I like the concept of crypto but do not have a strong understanding of it beyond the general ideas. In some ways I wonder how many people really know what is going on, very similar to the pre 2008 derivatives market build up.<p>I do like shiny things but am concerned that my current bullish mindset of precious metal might have more to do with being brainwashed to a certain extent from the media and advertising systems pushing that content to me.<p>So I was hoping I could humbly ask the YC community members to share their opinions on investing in one, two or all three of these market spaces.<p>As with anything regarding predicting the future there are no right or wrong answers and I understand any comments are opinions and not financial advice.:\\<p>Thanks",
