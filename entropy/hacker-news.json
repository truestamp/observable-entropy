      "text": "A group of agencies in Sweden have set up a project to find cloud providers who can provide an alternative to MS Teams&#x2F;O365 following the Schrems2 decision [1]. Similar work is ongoing in other EU countries. Will more US software providers find partners in the EU to run cloud services in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve risk of handing over customer data under FISA 702? There is definitely a huge need for compliant cloud solutions in the EU.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;computersweden.idg.se&#x2F;2.2683&#x2F;1.754943&#x2F;swedish-gov-teams-alternative",

I looked at react native, and even though it uses JavaScript on the client side, due to the JSX compiler it will be difficult to update the app dynamically(that is my understanding, please correct me if I am wrong).<p>So, the only option available is Cordova. If you are using Cordova for cross-platform apps development, what is your experience? And what are its pros and cons?",
