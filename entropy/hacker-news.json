      "text": "Hey all,<p>We are a small team and always struggled to track our product SLO&#x27;s and Error budgets. So we wrote a small tool to track our product SLO, Error-budget, False positive incidents, and SLO burning rate. It also provides some analytics into how the team might have spent their error budget over time. This tool saved us a lot of time which we would have otherwise spent in aggregating SLO metrics from multiple places. Hope this will be helpful for some.<p>Currently integration with Prometheus, Pingdom, Grafana and Newrelic are supported. We are planning to add a few more integrations in the near future.<p>We&#x27;ll be happy to get your feedback, suggestions and patches to make this a better tool for the community :)<p>Link to Github repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;roshan8&#x2F;slo-tracker\nBlog post: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;squadcast&#x2F;introducing-our-open-source-slo-tracker-a-simple-tool-to-track-slos-and-error-budget-4dp",
