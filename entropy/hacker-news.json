Can&#x27;t they be used for some amazing lossy image compression?<p>IMO, No hard-coded algorithm can work as well as a neural net to figure out how much information is needed for the human eye to understand an image.<p>What do you think? Also are there any discord&#x2F;other channels to discuss data compression?",
