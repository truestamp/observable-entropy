      "text": "I&#x27;m a machine learning engineer and the job requires a great deal of thinking and mental energy which I actually like. The problem is that I noticed that after work, I am not at all as chill as who I am on the weekends. Both my gf and mood tracker acknowledge that my mood is much more chill on the weekends.<p>Initially, I assumed this is because our projects are open-ended and after work, I&#x27;m still thinking about what to do tomorrow or some research ideas. This is partly correct but i tried 10 min meditation after work, 30 min reading a book and going out for 5 min to smoke. These helped not to think about work but I still feel that my &quot;thinking motor&quot; is still on and active. I think about a lot of things (this time not about work) and I am not at all as mindful and as chill as what I am on the weekends.<p>I noticed that on the weekends when I look at the flowers, i cherish the experience and enjoy this little thing. But after work, i still notice the beauty, but don&#x27;t feel that good experience of enjoying observing a beautiful flower. I think because I am not as mindful and as chill as what I am on the weekends.<p>Is it because deep down the work anxiety is still there? or scientifically we have a notion of &quot;thinking motor&quot; which we turn on during the day and it&#x27;s not clear how to turn it off? if we can turn it off and be like weekends, how?",

The static website generator space is too crowded to make sense of anything.<p>I am going to spend money on domain name and hosting, but we want to keep development&#x2F;maintenance in-house.

      "text": "Suggestion: Consider building a &quot;data center satellite&quot;, perhaps in\nsynchronous orbit, that contains a continuous upload of the whole\ninternet (a petabyte fits in a relatively small cube of silicon chips).<p>Add a &quot;local cache&quot; capability to each low earth satellite that holds\nrecently accessed pages. Pages can be marked with Time-to-live\nbefore needing a refresh so relatively static pages (like youtube)\ncan be kept and only highly active pages (e.g. news) can be swapped\n(and cached based on least-recently-used). This is essentially a CDN\n(e.g. an Akamai-like service).<p>The result is a much lower lag time, lower round-trips to Earth, \nand less need for Earth stations.<p>Plus, in the future, they could put such &quot;satellite data centers&quot;\nin orbit around Mars, thus minimizing Mars internet access times\nfor the Mars human data settlements.",
