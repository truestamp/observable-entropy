Sure, you can track every transaction on the blockchain, but unless you know what wallet address corresponds to which identity, you ain&#x27;t got bubkess.<p>As a result, I am leaving Binance, and I would encourage others to consider doing the same.<p>And just before anyone reaches for the age-old argument that &quot;they are a private corporation and can do what they want&quot;, I will preemptively respond: if too many big corps engage in bad behaviour, then you are left with no place to turn to and essentially lose your digital rights, so I find that argument to be naive, short sighted, and entirely unacceptable.<p>We must demand more of the businesses that we depend on. We must hold them to a higher standard so that we are not left in the end without alternatives.<p>Fight for your rights now, or risk being controlled and silenced forever.",
