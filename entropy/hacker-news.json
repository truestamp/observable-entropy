      "text": "Hi,<p>I&#x27;m thinking of starting a few side projects but very worried about the Intellectual Property clause within my employement contract I signed years ago.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a lawyer who could help me parse the following clauses, or am I snookered and should just quit.<p>I&#x27;m wordering how an overlap is determined. Would that be for a judge to decide?<p>From my contract:<p>We understand that lots of our employees have tech related ideas that they work on outside of working hours.

You will promptly provide to said company, and otherwise keep confidential, full written details of all inventions, copyright works or designs originated, conceived, written or made by you, alone or with others (“Intellectual Property”), and work relating to Intellectual Property that you have worked on at any time during the course of your employment with said company which relate to, or are reasonably capable of being used in, the business of said company (&quot;Employment IP&quot;). Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the CEO, you are assigning said company absolutely all rights, title, benefits and interests in the Employment IP.

      "text": "I&#x27;m a mid career research scientist (15 years post-PhD) with expertise in cloud computing and AI (mostly vision). I currently work at an industry research lab (almost a decade at my current employer) The work I have done has resulted in papers at top IEEE and ACM conferences, and I am in a quasi management position at my current employer (lead a team of 6; mix of scientists and engineers).<p>While being a success in an industry lab setting, I am interested in moving to an Internet scale company. I have a very hard time selling myself. The work I have done has not made it into products .. just papers and patents. I could probably move to a professor job as I have reputation in my subfield with a strong publication record, on the program committees of key conferences, etc.<p>I am extremely passionate about technology. I am also pretty decent as a manager (be it as a coach or where I am representing my part of the lab to other parts of the business). I also feel a bit of faker syndrome. I have a high salary (350K USD), which is problematic .. it makes going to small companies hard to stomach (I see engineering managers get paid 150K in some small companies) and the larger companies (FANG-Amazon) pay a lot more but seem impossible for me to get into. I did try getting into such companies when I was fresh out of school but flunked the interviews.<p>One other issue .. I feel at home coding but my currently role leave me nearly no time to code. I do management stuff and lead research projects.<p>Any advice would be most appreciated.",
