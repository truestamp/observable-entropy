      "text": "I noticed that engineers are less interested in VSOP in young startups as this means that they receive smaller salary, work till a burnout and risk that project dies before the vesting period ends. As alternative I was thinking to motivate them by providing quarterly bonuses for achieving reachable goals. This way, my hope is that as a company we can identify &quot;10X developers&quot; and retain them with a fair deal. This is a bit different to just &quot;increase compensation&quot; as usually engineers lose motivation with the time.<p>What do you think about this model?",
