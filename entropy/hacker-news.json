As a frequent user with lots of accounts I&#x27;ve noticed that the app is now significantly slower: It takes several seconds to start the application and to generate the next iteration of pins. The &quot;click to reveal pin&quot; is just jarring to use and doesn&#x27;t add any additional security in my opinion. Wondering if anybody else on HN shares this frustration.",
