      "text": "It&#x27;s been a few years since I took a look at WordPress - front-end UI only. (I&#x27;m not familar with the front-end and back-end code).<p>Recently I took a look at WordPress 5.8 (July 2021) to see what has changed.<p>The lastest version of WordPress has enabled &#x27;blocks&#x27; for full-site editing i.e. blocks are not just for the main content part of a website but also for the surrounding site furniture like headings, footers, sidebars etc.<p>My first impression is that the block pattern is more flexible and rich in functionality for site editing. Is it also too complicated?<p>My impression: I like where WordPress is heading with the &#x27;block&#x27; concept. Other publishing platforms are taking a different focus e.g. Ghost.<p>I don&#x27;t how the changes have been met by the WordPress Community, but I&#x27;m interested in your take on the future of WordPress, and full site-editing using &#x27;blocks&#x27;.",
