      "text": "I&#x27;m trying to launch my SaaS product (ecommerce store builder) in the US, while living in another country (Vietnam). From alot of the advice I see on the internet, acquiring your first customers is best done through your network. While I did go to highschool in the US, that was a long time ago and I don&#x27;t have any network there. Some advice on how to get my first customers would be greatly appreciated.<p>I know it&#x27;s a big climb, but startups and software in general don&#x27;t exist in Vietnam unless you are willing to stay unprofitable. The market leader in my product category has been unprofitable for 13 years, running on VC money. So this is not just a move out of the blue, but rather necessary for our survival. Thanks for reading.",
