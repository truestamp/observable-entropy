      "text": "In my Calc 2 course, we&#x27;re essentially just taught how to solve different types of problems, one after the other. Right now we&#x27;re finding the volume of solids created by rotating a the graph of a function about an axis. That kind of thing.<p>Anyway, a majority of my peers don&#x27;t learn nearly as much from the lectures or the textbook (which is godawful) as much as they learn from the Internet. In particular channels like Organic Chemistry Tutor. I have no data, but I would not be surprised if the failure rates for math classes would be much, much higher if not for YouTube videos making up for universities&#x27; incompetence at actually teaching.<p>My problem is that I prefer written explanations over text, since it&#x27;s a lot faster and I can listen to music while I do it instead of a very slow voice-over. My issue with textbooks is that the ones I&#x27;ve read have been basically unreadable compared to the clarity and practicality of video tutorials.<p>Are there any sources that will teach me Calc in a clear and comprehensible way, preferably with worked solutions for problems?",

      "text": "Hello, I am interested in compilers and have been trying to build my own compiler.<p>To make things little easier for me, I have defined my grammar and tokens to resemble Algol, which made tokenizing easier and I have a near complete tokenizer.<p>So I was able to get an input stream and transform it into an array of tokens, but I was having a hard time parsing, turning the array into a tree (AST).<p>After I wish to try try different parsing techniques to learn more about parsing and hopefully attempt at writing a semantic analyzer.<p>I was hoping to get some recommendation on where to start and good resources that I can use to achieve my goal.<p>Thanks",
