      "text": "One my friend wanted to post a rental listing last week on craigslist. In it, there is a description like this: &quot;One of the rooms is rented to a 4th-year male student, and we look for a respectful tenant to rent the other room.&quot;<p>however, the system doesn&#x27;t allow the posting to be published, citing the reason that the keyword &quot;male&quot; is used. It&#x27;s an automatic block. No human review or flagging.<p>It seems craigslist blocks rental posting with gender keyword regardless of the intention of the word&#x27;s usage.<p>Why does Craigslist does that? Is it to comply with some law? or is it because of some potential legal liability as the host of classified advertisements? Is it a technical reason?",
