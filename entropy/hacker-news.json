      "text": "2021 is coming to an end. Let&#x27;s look back at how good (or crappy) our predictions and expectations were considering the uncertainty during this pandemic. The expectations can be yours (e.g. &quot;my 2021 resolutions&quot;).<p>To make the discussion more useful, I propose this format:<p>- My predictions: We recover from the pandemic even though life is not 100% back to normal.<p>- My expectations: 1. To launch a personal project (mobile app). 2. To write more.<p>- What happened: 1. I guess the recovery will happen in 2022 instead. 2. The app launched after much delay but was still half-baked. I blame it on using fancy new tech, also unclear direction. 3. I bought a house for investment. This life event sparked an idea for my app and hopefully will give more direction, still refining the idea. 4. I realized I&#x27;m not good at foreseeing the future esp. for my financial benefit.",
