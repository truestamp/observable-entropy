By saying &quot;getting hurt&quot; I intend to include all minor injuries that jeopardize your next session or your work so that&#x27;s why I put &quot;exhausting too much&quot; in the title.<p>I imagine for someone who is active and has good joints, he&#x2F;she might be able to burn 400-500 calories every day BEFORE going to work. But is anything more than that, say, 800-1000 calories possible for you? I guess it&#x27;s a completely different picture for athletes so this is targeted for laymen.",
