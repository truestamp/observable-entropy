Google fi charges $10 &#x2F; GB for additional data only SIMs, Twilio Super SIMs are $0.10 &#x2F; MB, and now Verizon is offering 5G Home Unlimited for $50 month-to-month.<p>The use case I&#x27;m trying to solve for is an urban location where sensors are sending MQTT data on an occasional basis and not using more than 1 or 2 GB per month. At the moment, the Google fi SIM is the most cost effective, but it isn&#x27;t scalable in a business context.<p>What are others doing to resolve cellular data connectivity at a reasonable price?",
