I don&#x27;t feel like carrying my 4K monitor in my hand luggage.<p>Are there VR headsets good enough for remote work?<p>Note: I own the Quest 2 and I don&#x27;t consider it good enough for this purpose (I used the Immersed app). I know people say that you get used to it. I didn&#x27;t get used to it. I&#x27;d much rather use a 4K screen. I do like the Quest 2 for gaming (e.g. Eleven Table Tennis or Beat Saber).<p>Also solutions like Simula VR is not what I&#x27;m looking for as I&#x27;m looking for a monitor replacement.",
