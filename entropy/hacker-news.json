Post your trial-project idea(s) that you would like to work on with your potential co-founder as a pilot project before committing to working on a startup.<p>2. Invite other members to join you, or join other member&#x27;s trial-project.<p>3. Discuss each other&#x27;s trial-project ideas and decide on one project that you would work together on a trial basis. Set a deadline for the project.<p>4. Demo your project to other members on the server.<p>5. Decide whether to work together on actual startup, or part ways.<p>6. If trial-project team clicks and decide to work together then congratulation; go build that next unicorn. Or go to step #1 above and repeat.<p>Server is at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;qz6HcPKnbw",
