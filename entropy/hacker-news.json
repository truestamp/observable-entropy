Reflexively we purchased rat baits, and are now seeing the fruits of our purchase.<p>Now I doubt whether the simple act of a being trying to find safe shelter should result in the brutal death of that rat and it’s friends&#x2F;family. A car is merely a possession, and yet in response I have painfully killed many innocent beings.<p>I feel I’ve overreacted. Does anybody have any thoughts regarding taking life to protect mere possessions?",
