      "text": "The average wakes up time informs what’s called “temperature minimum” — the time in each 24-hour cycle when your body’s temperature is the lowest. The actual temp is not essential, but the time tends to be two hours before your typical wake-up time if you&#x27;re consistent with sleep schedule.<p>The temperature minimum defines the trough of your temperature across the 24-hour cycle. And immediately after that, your temperature will start to rise.<p>You can be reasonably sure that your best work will be done anywhere from four to six hours after your temperature minimum. Nobody can say the exact time. You have to find it. It could be four, five or six hours after your minimum temperature and it varies from person to person.<p>If you’re someone who wakes up on average at 7:00 a.m., your minimum temperature is at 5:00 a.m. If you tend to wake up around 6:30 a.m., that means your temperature minimum is at 4:30 a.m. You can add five hours to that time which would mean that a 90-minute deep focus work session could fall at 9:30 a.m. and the timing would be pretty optimised. Or you could do it at 10:30 a.m. or 8:30 a.m. Somewhere in that time frame would be all right. Find the right timing for you.",
