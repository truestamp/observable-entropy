      "text": "So I had enough of failing to understand some of the words in English which are super obscure. :)<p>I&#x27;ve built Wordle Hints.<p>This has three hints.<p>One: You can select an individual letter to be revealed.<p>Two: You can reveal two hints which is one synonym of the word and another explanation of the word. A complete sentence which explains the meaning of it so you can understand and move forward.<p>I&#x27;m using this to further my vocabulary. It&#x27;s fully automatic, so there is always a word and explanation available. It doesn&#x27;t track anything, it&#x27;s free forever and I do make any kind of extra network calls. The whole code can be found here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wordlehints&#x2F;wordlehints\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wordlehints&#x2F;wordlehints</a>.<p>Please don&#x27;t scrutinise the Javascript and HTML too much. This is my first site and I have no experience writing Javascript just like a little tiny bit. :)<p>Thanks!",
