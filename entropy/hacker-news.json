      "text": "Hey guys,<p>I drive to work a lot, spending on average of 2 hours each day. So I have plenty of time to listen to Podcast and audiobook on my ride. And I think it would be nice to be able to do the same with my reading list, but I couldn&#x27;t find any decent app on the market that doing this. So I set out to do it myself.<p>Sooo this is the product: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sendtopod.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sendtopod.com&#x2F;</a><p>You may ask why?<p>The reasons are simple:<p>- It&#x27;s more convenient to listen to articles while you driving, running, or even before going to bed.\n- Listen take less effort than reading.\n- Your eyes need to rest after staring at screens all day.\n- Podcast app is a great tools for listening to audio content with support for:\n  - CarPlay, Android Auto support built-in\n  - Smart queuing\n  - Offline listening<p>I see that <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hq.getmatter.app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hq.getmatter.app&#x2F;</a> did a great job of read later app, it also have an OK text to speech audio, but does not have a podcast feed I can subscribe to.<p>I also see AudioRead.com do this but text to speech is IMHO not pleasant enough to listen to for a long time.<p>I&#x27;m running beta for this, would love to hear your feedback on ... anything really.<p>Thanks you all!",
