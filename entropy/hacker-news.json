      "text": "I recently heard that some senior management at my company monitor employee &quot;work habit&quot; using Microsoft Office&#x27;s Viva monitoring (across all their reports).<p>I do get &quot;Viva digest&quot; email, but it is grossly inaccurate for me. It says I have &quot;80%&quot; focus time when clearly I have been in meetings (sometimes unnecessary but beyond my control) and in-person collaboration all day for a week.<p>I can&#x27;t think what could be wrong! Sometimes I don&#x27;t get time to &quot;accept&quot; my meetings (mainly because I haven&#x27;t figured out which one of my conflicts to pick) but I still attend the one I feel is appropriate.<p>Could Viva be using this to predict that I am not attending a meeting?<p>Where is the accountability on Microsoft for having designed unverifiable and un-auditable monitoring methods that clearly could affect people&#x27;s career?<p>Do they assume I am &quot;working&quot; entirely inside office products?<p>I am fairly key employee that I am not particularly worried, and my immediate manager is a sane person. but I can&#x27;t imagine what happens to some poor soul who needs to keep their job.<p>I guess I will stop my rant. Anyone with similar experience?",
