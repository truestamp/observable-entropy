      "text": "I recently read &quot;Out of the Tarpit&quot;, where the claim was that state management and side-effects was a big cause of complexity in our code bases. Wanted to hear concrete stories of whether that was true.<p>A friend was telling me that he had to write a user onboarding flow involving external APIs like Stripe and Mailchimp. Writing it and testing it involved setup on staging accounts and mocking the objects that got returned from the service.<p>I was wondering if HN had any war stories about how side-effects really made your code base more complicated and made your job harder. Or maybe it wasn&#x27;t, and you were able to find easy ways to mitigate state management&#x2F;side effect complications?",
