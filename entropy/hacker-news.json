      "text": "I decided to leave my boring 9-5 job and concentrate on a side project. Based on profits it was and is a no brainer, simply the right thing to do.<p>Now after about nearly 8 months, I really struggle. On the social part:<p>- kind of miss the boring big meetings\n- miss talk and argue with colleagues. Even with the annoying one. \n- The small battles were kind of fun, in retrospective.<p>and so on. Of course the obvious solution would be to get some employees. BUT I don&#x27;t want to hire, only because I need a bit social interaction.<p>Anyone in a similar situation? Maybe I miss some obvious solutions. Would love to hear from you guys!",
