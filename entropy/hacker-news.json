      "text": "Many here might already know that the controversial new 802.11bf wifi standard, set to be introduced in 2024, will enable active &quot;remote monitoring&quot; of movements or objects through the microwaves the devices themselves emit. Microwave sensing works similar to the more well known radar or ultrasound.<p>I&#x27;m trying to find out if remote sensing&#x2F;monitoring is something that&#x27;s in practice possible with the 5G antennas that are installed everywhere now. I&#x27;ve searched for papers but might not know the exact terminology, so I didn&#x27;t find anything. I know it&#x27;s theoretically possible and what made me wonder is that with the new wifi standard they&#x27;re shortening the wavelength specifically to get higher resolution imagery. I&#x27;ve seen the argument brought up many times that 5G doesn&#x27;t bring much speed advantages and that many people don&#x27;t understand why they increased the frequency so much, which creates some problems (like shorter working distance, for example). Now maybe I&#x27;m going full conspiracy here, but it would make perfect sense to do this if one of the goals were monitoring the movement of EVERYTHING in the range of the mobile network antennas. Is this a thing that could practically be done? Feel free to tell me I&#x27;m crazy, but please do include an explanation with a source for why or why not.",
